Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000), stdin contains `t` inputs: strings `s`, each consisting of lowercase English letters and of length at most 10.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    s = input().strip(' ')
    a = set()
    for i in s:
        a.add(i)
    if len(a) > 1:
        print('YES')
        newstr = s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]
        isreverse = s[::-1]
        if newstr != s:
            print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2])
        elif isreverse != s:
            print(isreverse)
        else:
            print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[0:len(s) // 2])
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is the last character in the string `s`, `s` is an empty string, `a` is a set containing all unique characters from the input string `s`. If the number of unique characters in `s` is more than 1, then if newstr is not equal to s, the second half of the string s concatenated with the first half of the string s is printed. If newstr is equal to s, the string s is rearranged by swapping its first and second halves, and if isreverse is equal to s, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, the value of isreverse is printed. If the number of unique characters in `s` is less than or equal to 1, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 1, `s` is a string containing a single line of input from stdin with leading and trailing spaces removed, `i` is the last character in the string `s`, `a` is a set containing all unique characters in the string `s`. If `a` contains more than one unique character, 'YES' is printed and either the reverse of `s` or the second half of `s` followed by the first half of `s` is printed depending on whether the reverse of `s` is equal to `s` or not. If `a` contains only one unique character, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`s` is a non-empty string containing a single line of input from stdin with leading and trailing spaces removed, `a` is a set containing all characters in the string `s`, `t` is greater than the last character in the string `s` plus 1, `i` is the last character in the string `s`, `stdin` is empty. If `a` has more than one character, 'YES' is printed. If the rotation of `s` by half its length is not equal to `s`, then the second half of the string `s` followed by the first half of the string `s` is printed. If the rotation of `s` by half its length is equal to `s` and the reverse of `s` is not equal to `s`, the reverse of `s` is printed. If the rotation of `s` by half its length is equal to `s` and the reverse of `s` is equal to `s`, then the second half of the string `s` followed by the first half of the string `s` is printed. If `a` has only one character, 'NO' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
