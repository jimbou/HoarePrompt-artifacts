The only variable in the loop head is variable  `t` and `i`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is the last character in the string `s`. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is the last character in the string `s` plus 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than the last character in the string `s` plus 1.
State: **`t` is greater than the last character in the string `s` plus 1, `s` is a string containing a single line of input from stdin with leading and trailing spaces removed, `i` is the last character in the string `s` plus 1, `a` is a set containing all unique characters in the string `s`.**
