The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 10, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `values` is a list of `max(numbers)` + 1 zeros, `sum_values` is a list of `max(numbers)` + 1 zeros, and `total` is 0. These states do not ensure that the loop will execute, so they need to be adjusted to `i` is less than 10.

State: **`t` is 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `values` is a list of `max(numbers)` + 1 zeros, `sum_values` is a list of `max(numbers)` + 1 zeros, `total` is 0, `i` is less than 10**
