Functionality: **This function reads a sequence of integers from standard input, calculates the sum of all integers from 0 to each number in the sequence, and prints the results. The function first initializes two lists, `values` and `sum_values`, to store the calculated values and their cumulative sums, respectively. It then populates these lists using a recursive formula based on the last digit and remaining digits of each number. Finally, it prints the cumulative sum for each number in the input sequence.**
