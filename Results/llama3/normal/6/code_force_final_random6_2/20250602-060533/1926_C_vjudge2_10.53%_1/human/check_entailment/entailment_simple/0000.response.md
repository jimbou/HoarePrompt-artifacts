Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the sum of the numbers on the board after Vladislav replaces each integer with the sum of its digits. The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the sum of the digits for each number from 1 to n, and then prints the sum of the numbers on the board for each test case.

The program first initializes two lists, `values` and `sum_values`, to store the sum of the digits for each number and the sum of the numbers on the board up to each number, respectively. It then calculates the sum of the digits for each number from 1 to n using dynamic programming, and stores the results in the `values` and `sum_values` lists.

Finally, the program prints the sum of the numbers on the board for each test case by looking up the corresponding value in the `sum_values` list.

Correctness: **True**
