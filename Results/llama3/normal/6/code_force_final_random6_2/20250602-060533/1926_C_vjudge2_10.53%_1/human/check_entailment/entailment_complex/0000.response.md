Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the sum of the numbers on the board after Vladislav replaces each integer with the sum of its digits. The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the sum of the numbers from 1 to n, where n is the largest number Vladislav writes.

The program first initializes two lists, `values` and `sum_values`, to store the calculated values and their cumulative sums, respectively. It then populates these lists using a recursive formula based on the last digit and remaining digits of each number.

The program correctly handles the base cases for numbers from 1 to 9 and then uses a loop to calculate the values and cumulative sums for numbers from 10 to n. The recursive formula used is correct, and the program correctly updates the `values` and `sum_values` lists.

Finally, the program prints the cumulative sum for each number in the input sequence, which is the desired output.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The loop that calculates the values and cumulative sums for numbers from 10 to n uses the variable `n` which is the maximum number in the input sequence. This means that the program will only calculate the values and cumulative sums up to the maximum number in the input sequence, not for each individual number in the sequence.

To fix this error, the program should use a separate variable to iterate over the numbers from 10 to the maximum number in the input sequence, and use the `n` variable to access the corresponding value in the `sum_values` list.

Correctness: **False**
