The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 11, `n` is greater than or equal to 11. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 12, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than or equal to 12.
State: **`t` is 0, numbers is a list containing t integers between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, values is a list of max(numbers) + 1 integers where the ith index is i, except for the 10th index which is the sum of the last digit of i and the value at the index of the remaining digits of i, and the 11th index which is the sum of the last digit of 11 and the value at the index of the remaining digits of 11, sum_values is a list of max(numbers) + 1 integers where the ith index is the sum of all integers from 0 to i, except for the 10th index which is the sum of the value at the 10th index and the sum of all integers from 0 to 9, and the 11th index which is the sum of the value at the 11th index and the sum of all integers from 0 to 10, total is 45, i is 12, n is greater than or equal to 12**
