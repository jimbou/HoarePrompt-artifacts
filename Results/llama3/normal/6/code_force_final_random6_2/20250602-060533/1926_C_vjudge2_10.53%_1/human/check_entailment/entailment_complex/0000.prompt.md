Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

    numbers = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        numbers.append(n)
        
    #State: t is 0, numbers is a list containing t integers between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, stdin is empty.
    values = [(0) for _ in range(max(numbers) + 1)]

    for i in range(10, n + 1):
        word = str(i)
        
        last = int(word[len(word) - 1])
        
        remainder = int(word[:-1])
        
        values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]
        
        sum_total = values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]
        
        sum_values[i] = sum_total
        
    #State: t is 0, numbers is a list containing t integers between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, values is a list of max(numbers) + 1 integers where the ith index is i, except for the indices from 10 to n which are the sum of the last digit of i and the value at the index of the remaining digits of i, sum_values is a list of max(numbers) + 1 integers where the ith index is the sum of all integers from 0 to i, except for the indices from 10 to n which are the sum of the value at the ith index and the sum of all integers from 0 to i - 1, total is 45, i is n + 1, n is greater than or equal to 10
    for n in numbers:
        print(sum_values[n])
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `numbers` is an empty list, `values` is a list of max(initial_numbers) + 1 integers where the ith index is i, except for the indices from 10 to max(initial_numbers) which are the sum of the last digit of i and the value at the index of the remaining digits of i, `sum_values` is a list of max(initial_numbers) + 1 integers where the ith index is the sum of all integers from 0 to i, except for the indices from 10 to max(initial_numbers) which are the sum of the value at the ith index and the sum of all integers from 0 to i - 1, `total` is 45, `i` is max(initial_numbers) + 1, `n` is the last number in the list `initial_numbers`, and the sum of all integers from 0 to n is being printed for all numbers in the list `initial_numbers`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a sequence of integers from standard input, calculates the sum of all integers from 0 to each number in the sequence, and prints the results. The function first initializes two lists, `values` and `sum_values`, to store the calculated values and their cumulative sums, respectively. It then populates these lists using a recursive formula based on the last digit and remaining digits of each number. Finally, it prints the cumulative sum for each number in the input sequence.
