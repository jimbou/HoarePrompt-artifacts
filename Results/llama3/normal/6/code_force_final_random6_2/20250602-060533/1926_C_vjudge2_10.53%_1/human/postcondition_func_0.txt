This function reads a sequence of integers from standard input, calculates the cumulative sum of values for each integer based on a specific formula, and prints the cumulative sum for each integer. The formula involves summing the values of the digits in each integer, where the value of each digit is determined by its position in the integer. The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a single integer. The function does not return any value, but instead prints the cumulative sum for each integer in the input sequence.
