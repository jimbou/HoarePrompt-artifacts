Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive, numbers is a list containing two integers between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive.**

The code snippet first assigns an integer value from stdin to `n`. Since stdin is empty in the initial state, this line does not affect any variables. The second line appends the value of `n` to the list `numbers`. As a result, `numbers` now contains two integers between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive. The value of `t` remains unchanged.
