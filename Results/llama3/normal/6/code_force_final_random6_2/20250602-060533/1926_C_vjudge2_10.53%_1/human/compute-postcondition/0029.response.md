To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `n` and `numbers`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more numbers in the list `numbers`. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is the second number in the list `numbers`, and `i` is `n + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `n` should be the next number in the list `numbers`, and `i` should be reset to the first number in the list `numbers`.

Since `numbers` is a list containing at least 2 integers, we can assume that there is a third number in the list. Let's call this number `next_n`.

State: **`t` is 0, `numbers` is a list containing at least 3 integers between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `values` is a list of max(numbers) + 1 integers where the ith index is i, except for the indices from 10 to next_n which are the sum of the last digit of i and the value at the index of the remaining digits of i, `sum_values` is a list of max(numbers) + 1 integers where the ith index is the sum of all integers from 0 to i, except for the indices from 10 to next_n which are the sum of the value at the ith index and the sum of all integers from 0 to i - 1, `total` is 45, `i` is next_n, `n` is next_n**
