Output State: **t is 0, numbers is a list containing t integers between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, values is a list of max(numbers) + 1 integers where the ith index is i, sum_values is a list of max(numbers) + 1 integers where the ith index is the sum of all integers from 0 to i, total is 20, i is 10, values[i] is 10, sum_values[i] is 20**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged at 0. The list `numbers` still contains `t` integers between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, but its specific elements are not modified by the code. The list `values` has its `i`th index updated to `i`, which is 10. The list `sum_values` has its `i`th index updated to `total`, which is now 20. The variable `total` is incremented by `i`, which is 10, making it 20. The variable `i` remains unchanged at 10.
