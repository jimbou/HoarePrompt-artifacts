Output State: **t is 0, numbers is a list containing t integers between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, values is a list of max(numbers) + 1 integers where the ith index is i, sum_values is a list of max(numbers) + 1 integers where the ith index is the sum of all integers from 0 to i, total is i + 1, i is less than 11, values[i] is i, total is i + 1, sum_values[i] is i + 1**

The code executes three lines. The first line assigns the value of `i` to `values[i]`. The second line increments `total` by the value of `i`. The third line assigns the value of `total` to `sum_values[i]`. Since `i` is less than 11, `values[i]` becomes `i`, `total` becomes `i + 1`, and `sum_values[i]` becomes `i + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
