Output State: **t is 0, numbers is a list containing t integers between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, values is a list of max(numbers) + 1 integers where the ith index is i, sum_values is a list of max(numbers) + 1 integers where the ith index is the sum of all integers from 0 to i, total is i, i is less than 10**

The code modifies the values of `values`, `sum_values`, and `total`. The first line assigns the value of `i` to the `i`th index of `values`. The second line increments `total` by the value of `i`. The third line assigns the value of `total` to the `i`th index of `sum_values`. Since `i` is less than 10, the values of `values` and `sum_values` are updated accordingly. The value of `total` is also updated to be equal to `i`. The other variables, `t` and `numbers`, remain unchanged.
