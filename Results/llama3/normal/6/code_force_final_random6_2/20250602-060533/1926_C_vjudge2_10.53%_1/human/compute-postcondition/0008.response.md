Output State: **t is 0, numbers is a list containing t integers between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, values is a list of max(numbers) + 1 zeros, sum_values is a list of max(numbers) + 1 zeros, total is 0**

In this output state, the initial state's information about `t` and `numbers` remains unchanged as the code snippet does not modify these variables. The code introduces three new variables: `values`, `sum_values`, and `total`. 

`values` and `sum_values` are both lists initialized with zeros, where the length of each list is determined by `max(numbers) + 1`. Since `numbers` contains integers between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, the maximum value in `numbers` will be at most 2 * 10^5. Therefore, `values` and `sum_values` will each have a length of at most 2 * 10^5 + 1.

`total` is initialized to 0 and remains unchanged throughout the code snippet.

The final state includes all the information from the initial state that remains valid after the code execution, along with the new variables and their values introduced by the code.
