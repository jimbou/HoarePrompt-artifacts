Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, numbers is an empty list, stdin contains 1 input: a sequence of integers (between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive)**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `t`. Since the input is between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `t` becomes an integer within this range. The second line initializes an empty list `numbers`. No other variables are affected. Stdin now contains only one input: a sequence of integers (between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive).
