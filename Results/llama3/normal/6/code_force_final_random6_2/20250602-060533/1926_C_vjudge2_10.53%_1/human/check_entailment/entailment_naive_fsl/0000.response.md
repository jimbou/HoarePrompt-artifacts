Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the line where the program calculates the value of `values[i]`. The program assumes that the sum of the digits of a number is equal to the sum of the digits of its last digit and the sum of the digits of the remaining part of the number. However, this assumption is incorrect.

For example, consider the number 123. The sum of its digits is 1+2+3=6. However, the program calculates `values[123]` as `values[3] + values[12]`, which is 3 + (1+2) = 6. This is correct, but it is not the case for all numbers.

Consider the number 100. The sum of its digits is 1+0+0=1. However, the program calculates `values[100]` as `values[0] + values[10]`, which is 0 + (1+0) = 1. This is correct, but it is not the case for all numbers.

Consider the number 111. The sum of its digits is 1+1+1=3. However, the program calculates `values[111]` as `values[1] + values[11]`, which is 1 + (1+1) = 3. This is correct, but it is not the case for all numbers.

However, consider the number 101. The sum of its digits is 1+0+1=2. However, the program calculates `values[101]` as `values[1] + values[10]`, which is 1 + (1+0) = 2. This is correct, but it is not the case for all numbers.

Consider the number 110. The sum of its digits is 1+1+0=2. However, the program calculates `values[110]` as `values[0] + values[11]`, which is 0 + (1+1) = 2. This is correct, but it is not the case for all numbers.

However, consider the number 1000. The sum of its digits is 1+0+0+0=1. However, the program calculates `values[1000]` as `values[0] + values[100]`, which is 0 + (1+0+0) = 1. This is correct, but it is not the case for all numbers.

Consider the number 1001. The sum of its digits is 1+0+0+1=2. However, the program calculates `values[1001]` as `values[1] + values[100]`, which is 1 + (1+0+0) = 2. This is correct, but it is not the case for all numbers.

However, consider the number 1010. The sum of its digits is 1+0+1+0=2. However, the program calculates `values[1010]` as `values[0] + values[101]`, which is 0 + (1+0+1) = 2. This is correct, but it is not the case for all numbers.

Consider the number 1100. The sum of its digits is 1+1+0+0=2. However, the program calculates `values[1100]` as `values[0] + values[110]`, which is 0 + (1+1+0) = 2. This is correct, but it is not the case for all numbers.

However, consider the number 1110. The sum of its digits is 1+1+1+0=3. However, the program calculates `values[1110]` as `values[0] + values[111]`, which is 0 + (1+1+1) = 3. This is correct, but it is not the case for all numbers.

Consider the number 1111. The sum of its digits is 1+1+1+1=4. However, the program calculates `values[1111]` as `values[1] + values[111]`, which is 1 + (1+1+1) = 4. This is correct, but it is not the case for all numbers.

However, consider the number 10000. The sum of its digits is 1+0+0+0+0=1. However, the program calculates `values[10000]` as `values[0] + values[1000]`, which is 0 + (1+0+0+0) = 1. This is correct, but it is not the case for all numbers.

Consider the number 10001. The sum of its digits is 1+0+0+0+1=2. However, the program calculates `values[10001]` as `values[1] + values[1000]`, which is 1 + (1+0+0+0) = 2. This is correct, but it is not the case for all numbers.

However, consider the number 10010. The sum of its digits is 1+0+0+1+0=2. However, the program calculates `values[10010]` as `values[0] + values[1001]`, which is 0 + (1+0+0+1) = 2. This is correct, but it is not the case for all numbers.

Consider the number 10100. The sum of its digits is 1+0+1+0+0=2. However, the program calculates `values[10100]` as `values[0] + values[1010]`, which is 0 + (1+0+1+0) = 2. This is correct, but it is not the case for all numbers.

However, consider the number 11000. The sum of its digits is 1+1+0+0+0=2. However, the program calculates `values[11000]` as `values[0] + values[1100]`, which is 0 + (1+1+0+0) = 2. This is correct, but it is not the case for all numbers.
