The only variable in the loop head is variable  t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is between 1 and 10^4 inclusive. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive, numbers is a list containing a single integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, stdin is empty**
