Output State: **t is 0, numbers is a list containing t integers between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, values is a list of max(numbers) + 1 integers where the ith index is i, sum_values is a list of max(numbers) + 1 integers where the ith index is the sum of all integers from 0 to i, total is 45, i is 10**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the output state after the loop executes 3 times, with the exception that the variable i is now 10, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
