Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, numbers is a list containing three integers between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The list `numbers` initially contained two integers between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive. After the execution of the code, the list `numbers` now contains three integers between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, as the code appends an integer `n` to the list. The integer `n` is obtained from the input, which is between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive.
