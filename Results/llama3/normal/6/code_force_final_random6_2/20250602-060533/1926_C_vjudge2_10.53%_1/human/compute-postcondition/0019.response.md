Output State: **t is 0, numbers is a list containing t integers between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, values is a list of max(numbers) + 1 integers where the ith index is i, except for the 10th index which is the sum of the last digit of i and the value at the index of the remaining digits of i, and the 11th index which is the sum of the last digit of 11 and the value at the index of the remaining digits of 11, sum_values is a list of max(numbers) + 1 integers where the ith index is the sum of all integers from 0 to i, except for the 10th index which is the sum of the value at the 10th index and the sum of all integers from 0 to 9, and the 11th index which is the sum of the value at the 11th index and the sum of all integers from 0 to 10, total is 45, i is 11, n is greater than or equal to 11**

Explanation:

The code block modifies the values of `values` and `sum_values` lists at the 11th index. The `values` list now has an additional exception at the 11th index, where the value is the sum of the last digit of 11 (1) and the value at the index of the remaining digits of 11 (10). The `sum_values` list also has an additional exception at the 11th index, where the value is the sum of the value at the 11th index and the sum of all integers from 0 to 10. The other variables remain unchanged.
