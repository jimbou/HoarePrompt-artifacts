Output: ** `t` is 0, `numbers` is a list containing at least 3 integers between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `values` is a list of max(numbers) + 1 integers where the ith index is i, except for the indices from 10 to next_n which are the sum of the last digit of i and the value at the index of the remaining digits of i, `sum_values` is a list of max(numbers) + 1 integers where the ith index is the sum of all integers from 0 to i, except for the indices from 10 to next_n which are the sum of the value at the ith index and the sum of all integers from 0 to i - 1, `total` is 45, `i` is next_n, `n` is next_n, and the sum of all integers from 0 to n is being printed**
