To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `n` and `numbers`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `numbers` list. If the list has at least 1 number, the loop can execute. Since `n` is the loop variable, it will take on the value of the first number in the list at the start of the loop.

State: **`t` is 0, `numbers` is a list containing at least 1 integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `values` is a list of max(numbers) + 1 integers where the ith index is i, except for the indices from 10 to n which are the sum of the last digit of i and the value at the index of the remaining digits of i, `sum_values` is a list of max(numbers) + 1 integers where the ith index is the sum of all integers from 0 to i, except for the indices from 10 to n which are the sum of the value at the ith index and the sum of all integers from 0 to i - 1, `total` is 45, `i` is n + 1, `n` is the first number in the list `numbers`**
