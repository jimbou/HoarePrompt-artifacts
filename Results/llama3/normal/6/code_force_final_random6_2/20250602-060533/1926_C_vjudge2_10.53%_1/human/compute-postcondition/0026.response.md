To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `n` and `numbers`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `numbers`. If the list has at least one more integer, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `numbers` is a list containing at least 1 integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `n` is the first number in the list `numbers`, and `i` is `n + 1`.

For the loop to execute again, `numbers` must have at least one more integer, and `n` must be the next integer in the list.

State: **`t` is 0, `numbers` is a list containing at least 2 integers between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `values` is a list of max(numbers) + 1 integers where the ith index is i, except for the indices from 10 to n which are the sum of the last digit of i and the value at the index of the remaining digits of i, `sum_values` is a list of max(numbers) + 1 integers where the ith index is the sum of all integers from 0 to i, except for the indices from 10 to n which are the sum of the value at the ith index and the sum of all integers from 0 to i - 1, `total` is 45, `i` is n + 1, `n` is the second number in the list `numbers`**
