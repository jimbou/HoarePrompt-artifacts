Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is 0, numbers is a list containing t integers between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, values is a list of max(numbers) + 1 integers where the ith index is i, sum_values is a list of max(numbers) + 1 integers where the ith index is the sum of all integers from 0 to i, total is 45, i is 10
Code of the loop:
for i in range(10, n + 1):
    word = str(i)
    last = int(word[len(word) - 1])
    remainder = int(word[:-1])
    values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]
    sum_total = values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]
    sum_values[i] = sum_total


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is 0, numbers is a list containing t integers between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, values is a list of max(numbers) + 1 integers where the ith index is i, except for the 10th index which is the sum of the last digit of i and the value at the index of the remaining digits of i, sum_values is a list of max(numbers) + 1 integers where the ith index is the sum of all integers from 0 to i, except for the 10th index which is the sum of the value at the 10th index and the sum of all integers from 0 to 9, total is 45, i is 10, n is greater than or equal to 10

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is 0, numbers is a list containing t integers between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, values is a list of max(numbers) + 1 integers where the ith index is i, except for the 10th index which is the sum of the last digit of i and the value at the index of the remaining digits of i, and the 11th index which is the sum of the last digit of 11 and the value at the index of the remaining digits of 11, sum_values is a list of max(numbers) + 1 integers where the ith index is the sum of all integers from 0 to i, except for the 10th index which is the sum of the value at the 10th index and the sum of all integers from 0 to 9, and the 11th index which is the sum of the value at the 11th index and the sum of all integers from 0 to 10, total is 45, i is 11, n is greater than or equal to 11

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is 0, numbers is a list containing t integers between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, values is a list of max(numbers) + 1 integers where the ith index is i, except for the 10th index which is the sum of the last digit of i and the value at the index of the remaining digits of i, the 11th index which is the sum of the last digit of 11 and the value at the index of the remaining digits of 11, and the 12th index which is the sum of the last digit of 12 and the value at the index of the remaining digits of 12, sum_values is a list of max(numbers) + 1 integers where the ith index is the sum of all integers from 0 to i, except for the 10th index which is the sum of the value at the 10th index and the sum of all integers from 0 to 9, the 11th index which is the sum of the value at the 11th index and the sum of all integers from 0 to 10, and the 12th index which is the sum of the value at the 12th index and the sum of all integers from 0 to 11, total is 45, i is 12, n is greater than or equal to 12




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
