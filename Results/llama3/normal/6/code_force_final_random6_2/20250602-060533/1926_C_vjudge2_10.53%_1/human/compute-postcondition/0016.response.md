To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than or equal to 10, since the range starts from 10.

State: **`t` is 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `values` is a list of max(numbers) + 1 integers where the ith index is i, `sum_values` is a list of max(numbers) + 1 integers where the ith index is the sum of all integers from 0 to i, `total` is 45, `i` is 10, `n` must be greater than or equal to 10**
