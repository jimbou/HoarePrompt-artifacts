#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (the number of test cases) and then a sequence of integers (the largest number Vladislav writes in each test case). The number of test cases is a positive integer and the largest number Vladislav writes in each test case is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^5.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a sequence of integers from standard input, calculates the cumulative sum of values for each integer based on a specific formula, and prints the cumulative sum for each integer. The formula involves summing the values of the digits in each integer, where the value of each digit is determined by its position in the integer. The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a single integer. The function does not return any value, but instead prints the cumulative sum for each integer in the input sequence.
