Output State: **t is 0, numbers is a list containing t integers between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, values is a list of max(numbers) + 1 integers where the ith index is i, except for the 10th index which is the sum of the last digit of i and the value at the index of the remaining digits of i, sum_values is a list of max(numbers) + 1 integers where the ith index is the sum of all integers from 0 to i, except for the 10th index which is the sum of the value at the 10th index and the sum of all integers from 0 to 9, total is 45, i is 10, n is greater than or equal to 10**

The code modifies the values of `values` and `sum_values` at the 10th index. The value of `values` at the 10th index is now the sum of the last digit of `i` (which is 0) and the value at the index of the remaining digits of `i` (which is 1). The value of `sum_values` at the 10th index is now the sum of the value at the 10th index of `values` and the sum of all integers from 0 to 9. The other variables remain unchanged.
