Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is 0, numbers is a list containing t integers between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, values is a list of max(numbers) + 1 integers where the ith index is i, except for the indices from 10 to n which are the sum of the last digit of i and the value at the index of the remaining digits of i, sum_values is a list of max(numbers) + 1 integers where the ith index is the sum of all integers from 0 to i, except for the indices from 10 to n which are the sum of the value at the ith index and the sum of all integers from 0 to i - 1, total is 45, i is n + 1, n is greater than or equal to 10
Code of the loop:
for n in numbers:
    print(sum_values[n])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is 0, `numbers` is a list containing at least 1 integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `values` is a list of max(numbers) + 1 integers where the ith index is i, except for the indices from 10 to n which are the sum of the last digit of i and the value at the index of the remaining digits of i, `sum_values` is a list of max(numbers) + 1 integers where the ith index is the sum of all integers from 0 to i, except for the indices from 10 to n which are the sum of the value at the ith index and the sum of all integers from 0 to i - 1, `total` is 45, `i` is n + 1, `n` is the first number in the list `numbers`, and the sum of all integers from 0 to n is being printed, where n is the first number in the list `numbers`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is 0, `numbers` is a list containing at least 2 integers between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `values` is a list of max(numbers) + 1 integers where the ith index is i, except for the indices from 10 to n which are the sum of the last digit of i and the value at the index of the remaining digits of i, `sum_values` is a list of max(numbers) + 1 integers where the ith index is the sum of all integers from 0 to i, except for the indices from 10 to n which are the sum of the value at the ith index and the sum of all integers from 0 to i - 1, `total` is 45, `i` is n + 1, `n` is the second number in the list `numbers`, and the sum of all integers from 0 to n is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is 0, `numbers` is a list containing at least 3 integers between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `values` is a list of max(numbers) + 1 integers where the ith index is i, except for the indices from 10 to next_n which are the sum of the last digit of i and the value at the index of the remaining digits of i, `sum_values` is a list of max(numbers) + 1 integers where the ith index is the sum of all integers from 0 to i, except for the indices from 10 to next_n which are the sum of the value at the ith index and the sum of all integers from 0 to i - 1, `total` is 45, `i` is next_n, `n` is next_n, and the sum of all integers from 0 to n is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
