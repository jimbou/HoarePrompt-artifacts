The code prints the value at the nth index of the `sum_values` list. 

Since `n` is the first number in the list `numbers`, the value at the nth index of the `sum_values` list is the sum of all integers from 0 to `n`, except for the indices from 10 to `n` which are the sum of the value at the ith index and the sum of all integers from 0 to `i - 1`.

Output: **the sum of all integers from 0 to n (where n is the first number in the list numbers)**
