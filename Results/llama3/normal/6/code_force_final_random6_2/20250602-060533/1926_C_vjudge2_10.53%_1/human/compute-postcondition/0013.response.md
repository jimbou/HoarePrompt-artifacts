To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the state of the variable `i` in the loop head.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than 10. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is less than 11, which means it can be 10 or less. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than 10.

So, we can adjust the state of `i` to be 10, which is the next value in the range.

State: **`t` is 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `values` is a list of max(numbers) + 1 integers where the ith index is i, `sum_values` is a list of max(numbers) + 1 integers where the ith index is the sum of all integers from 0 to i, `total` is 10 + 1, `i` is 10, `values[i]` is 10, `total` is 10 + 1, `sum_values[i]` is 10 + 1**
