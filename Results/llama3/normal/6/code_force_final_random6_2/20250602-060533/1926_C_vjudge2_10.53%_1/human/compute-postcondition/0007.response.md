Output State: **t is 0, numbers is a list containing t integers between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, stdin is empty.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable 't' will be 0 (since it started between 1 and 10^4 inclusive and decreased by 1 each iteration), the list 'numbers' will contain 't' integers (which is now 0, so the list will be empty), and the standard input 'stdin' will be empty (since all inputs have been read).
