This function calculates and prints the minimum value of a given integer `pergunta` and the sum of the minimum values of two lists `a` and `b` from index `m-1` to `0`. The function takes no arguments and returns no value, but it modifies the `pergunta` variable and prints the result. The function assumes that `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n`, and `m` is an integer such that `1 <= m <= n <= 200000`.
