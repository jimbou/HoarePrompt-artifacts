The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than -1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `m-2`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be `m-3` (since the loop iterates in reverse order with a step of -1).
State: **`pergunta` is the minimum of its original value and `x + a[m-2]`, `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= `n` <= 200000, `x` is the sum of the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for `i` from `n-1` down to `m-1`, and `i` is `m-3`**
