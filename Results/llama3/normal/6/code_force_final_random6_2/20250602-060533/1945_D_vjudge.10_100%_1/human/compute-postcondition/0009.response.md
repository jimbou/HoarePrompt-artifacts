Output State: **`pergunta` is the minimum of its original value and `x + a[m-2]`, `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= `n` <= 200000, `x` is the sum of the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for `i` from `n-1` down to `m-1`, and `i` is `m-2` if `i` is less than `m`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been updated to include the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for the current value of `i`, which is `m-2`. The other variables remain unchanged. The state of `pergunta` is still dependent on its original value and the updated value of `x + a[m-2]`. The lists `a` and `b` and the integer `n` and `m` remain unchanged.
