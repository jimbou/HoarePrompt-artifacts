Output State: **`pergunta` is the minimum of its original value and `x + a[m-2]`, `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= `n` <= 200000, `x` is the sum of the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for `i` from `n-1` down to `m`, and `i` is `m-2`.**

In this output state, the value of `pergunta` has been updated to be the minimum of its original value and `x + a[m-2]`. The values of the other variables, including `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, `x`, and `i`, remain unchanged.
