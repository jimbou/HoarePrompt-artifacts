According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is not guaranteed to be at least 1, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is now `n-1`.

State: **`pergunta` is an integer, `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= `n` <= 200000, `x` is 0, `i` is `n-1**
