Output State: **pergunta is the minimum of its original value and x + a[i] for all i from m-1 down to 0, a and b are lists of integers of length n, n is greater than or equal to 0, m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= n <= 200000, x is the sum of the minimum of a[i] and b[i] for i from n-1 down to 0, and i is -1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `pergunta` is the minimum of its original value and the sum of `x` and `a[i]` for all `i` from `m-1` down to `0`. The lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged, with a length of `n`. The value of `n` is greater than or equal to `0`, and `m` is an integer between `1` and `n` (inclusive), with a maximum value of `200000`. The variable `x` is the sum of the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from `n-1` down to `0`. Finally, the loop counter `i` is `-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
