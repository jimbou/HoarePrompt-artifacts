Output State: **`pergunta` is the minimum of its original value, `x + a[m-2]`, and if `i` is less than `m`, `x + a[m-3]`. `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= `n` <= 200000, `x` is the sum of the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for `i` from `n-1` down to `m-2`, and `i` is either `m-3` or remains unchanged if `i` is not less than `m`.**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been updated by adding the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` to it. The value of `i` remains unchanged if it is not less than `m`, otherwise it becomes `m-3`. The other variables, `pergunta`, `a`, `b`, `n`, and `m`, remain unchanged.
