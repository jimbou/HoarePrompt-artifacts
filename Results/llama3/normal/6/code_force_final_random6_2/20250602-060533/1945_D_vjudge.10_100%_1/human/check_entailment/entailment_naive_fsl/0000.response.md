Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first m people in line. The function `func_1` iterates over the list of people in reverse order, keeping track of the minimum cost to reach each position. It uses the variable `x` to accumulate the minimum cost to reach each position, and updates the `pergunta` variable with the minimum cost to reach a position that is within the first m people.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when m is 1, or when the number of people is equal to m. It also correctly handles the case when the cost to bribe a person is less than the cost to bribe the person in front of them.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem description work correctly with the given program. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
