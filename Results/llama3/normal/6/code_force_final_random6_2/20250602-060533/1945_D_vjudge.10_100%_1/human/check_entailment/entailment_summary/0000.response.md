Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. The function `func_1` calculates the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to reach a position among the first `m` people in the queue.

Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. The program initializes `pergunta` to infinity, which will store the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend.
2. The program iterates over the lists `a` and `b` from the end to the beginning (i.e., from `n-1` to `0`).
3. For each position `i`, if `i` is less than `m`, the program updates `pergunta` to be the minimum of its current value and the sum of the coins Kirill needs to spend to reach position `i` (i.e., `x + a[i]`).
4. The program updates `x` to be the sum of the minimum values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. This represents the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to reach position `i` from the end of the queue.
5. Finally, the program prints the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend, which is stored in `pergunta`.

The time complexity of the program is O(n), where n is the number of people in the queue. This is because the program iterates over the lists `a` and `b` once.

The space complexity of the program is O(1), excluding the input lists `a` and `b`. This is because the program only uses a constant amount of space to store the variables `pergunta`, `x`, and the loop counter `i`.

Correctness: **True**
