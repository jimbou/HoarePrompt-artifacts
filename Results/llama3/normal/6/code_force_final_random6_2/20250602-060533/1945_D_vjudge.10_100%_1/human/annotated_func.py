#State of the program right berfore the function call: pergunta is an integer, a and b are lists of integers of length n, n and m are integers such that 1 <= m <= n <= 200000, and the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if i < m:
            pergunta = min(pergunta, x + a[i])
        
        x += min(a[i], b[i])
        
    #State: pergunta is the minimum of its original value and x + a[i] for all i from m-1 down to 0, a and b are lists of integers of length n, n is greater than or equal to 0, m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= n <= 200000, x is the sum of the minimum of a[i] and b[i] for i from n-1 down to 0, and i is -1.
    print(pergunta)
    #This is printed: minimum value of pergunta (where pergunta is the minimum of its original value and x + a[i] for all i from m-1 down to 0)

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and prints the minimum value of a given integer `pergunta` and the sum of the minimum values of two lists `a` and `b` from index `m-1` to `0`. The function takes no arguments and returns no value, but it modifies the `pergunta` variable and prints the result. The function assumes that `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n`, and `m` is an integer such that `1 <= m <= n <= 200000`.
