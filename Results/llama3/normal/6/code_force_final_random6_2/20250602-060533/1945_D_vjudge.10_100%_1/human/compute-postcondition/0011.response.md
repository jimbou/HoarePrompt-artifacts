Output State: **`pergunta` is the minimum of its original value, `x + a[m-2]`, and `x + a[m-3]`, `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= `n` <= 200000, `x` is the sum of the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for `i` from `n-1` down to `m-1`, and `i` is `m-3`**
