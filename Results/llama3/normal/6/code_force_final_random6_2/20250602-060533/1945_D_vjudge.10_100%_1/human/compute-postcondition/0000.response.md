Output State: **`pergunta` is an integer, `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n`, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= `m` <= `n` <= 200000, and the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `x` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `x` that has been assigned the value 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
