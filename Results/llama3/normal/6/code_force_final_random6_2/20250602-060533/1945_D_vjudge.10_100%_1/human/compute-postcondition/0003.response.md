Output State: **`pergunta` is the minimum of its original value and `x + a[i]`, `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= `n` <= 200000, `x` is 0, `i` is `n-1` and the current value of `i` is less than `m`.**

In this output state, the value of `pergunta` has been updated to be the minimum of its original value and the sum of `x` (which is 0) and the element at index `i` in list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged, with `a` and `b` still being lists of integers of length `n`, `n` still being greater than 0, `m` still being an integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive), `x` still being 0, and `i` still being `n-1` and less than `m`.
