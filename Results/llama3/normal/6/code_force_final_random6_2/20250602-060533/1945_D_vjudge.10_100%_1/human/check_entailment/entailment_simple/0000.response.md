Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input data, including the number of test cases, the number of people in the queue, the maximum allowable final position of Kirill, and the values of `a` and `b`.

2. The program initializes the variable `pergunta` to infinity, which will be used to store the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend.

3. The program then iterates over the values of `a` and `b` in reverse order (from `n-1` to `0`). For each iteration, it checks if the current position `i` is less than the maximum allowable final position `m`. If it is, the program updates the value of `pergunta` to be the minimum of its current value and the sum of `x` (the cumulative sum of the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`) and `a[i]`.

4. The program also updates the value of `x` by adding the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` to it. This ensures that `x` always stores the cumulative sum of the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` from the current position `i` to the end of the queue.

5. Finally, the program prints the minimum value of `pergunta`, which represents the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to reach a position within the maximum allowable final position `m`.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
