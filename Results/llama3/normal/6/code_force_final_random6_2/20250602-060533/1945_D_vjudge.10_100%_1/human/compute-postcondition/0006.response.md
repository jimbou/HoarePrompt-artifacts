To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):`, which means that `i` is the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted.

According to the code, `i` starts at `n - 1` and decrements by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `-1`. Since `i` is `m - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, we need to decrement it by 1 to get the next value.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`pergunta` is the minimum of its original value and `x + a[i]`, `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= `n` <= 200000, `x` is the sum of the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for `i` from `n-1` down to `m`, and `i` is `m-2`**

Note that we only adjusted the state of `i`, as it is the only variable in the loop head. The other variables remain unchanged.
