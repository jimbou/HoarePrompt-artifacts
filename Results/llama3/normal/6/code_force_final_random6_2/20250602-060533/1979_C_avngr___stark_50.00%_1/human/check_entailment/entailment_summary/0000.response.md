Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem where the goal is to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. The program takes the number of outcomes and their corresponding multipliers as input and calculates the bets for each outcome.

The program first calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers, which is the smallest number that is a multiple of all the multipliers. It then calculates the bets for each outcome by dividing the LCM by the corresponding multiplier. The program also calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the bets to minimize the total amount of coins bet.

The program checks if the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the LCM divided by the GCD. If it is, the program prints the bets for each outcome. Otherwise, it prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required.

The execution summary shows that the program correctly calculates the GCD of the bets and uses it to minimize the total amount of coins bet. The program also correctly checks if the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the LCM divided by the GCD and prints the bets or -1 accordingly.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and execution summary, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
