Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least n elements, `hcf` is the Greatest Common Divisor of all elements of the list `numbers`, `num` is the last element of the list `numbers`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the list `numbers` remains unchanged, but the variable `hcf` now holds the Greatest Common Divisor of all elements in the list `numbers`. The variable `num` now holds the value of the last element in the list `numbers`.
