#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers, where each integer is a multiplier for the amount of coins if the corresponding outcome turns out to be winning, and the length of the list is the number of outcomes.
    hcf = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        hcf = gcd(hcf, num)
        
    #State: `numbers` is a list of integers with at least n elements, `hcf` is the Greatest Common Divisor of all elements of the list `numbers`, `num` is the last element of the list `numbers`.
    return hcf
    #The program returns the Greatest Common Divisor of all elements of the list `numbers`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of all elements in a given list of integers. It takes a list of integers as input, where each integer represents a multiplier for the amount of coins for a corresponding winning outcome, and returns the GCD of these multipliers. The function assumes the input list has at least one element.
