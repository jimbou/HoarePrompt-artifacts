Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem where you have to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. The program takes the number of test cases, the number of outcomes, and the multipliers for each outcome as input.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1.  The program first calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all the multipliers. This is done by multiplying all the multipliers together.
2.  Then, for each outcome, it calculates the amount of coins to bet by dividing the LCM by the multiplier for that outcome. This ensures that the amount of coins received back for each outcome will be the same.
3.  The program then calculates the highest common factor (HCF) of all the amounts of coins to bet. This is done using a custom function `func_1` that uses the `gcd` function from the `math` module to find the HCF.
4.  The program then divides each amount of coins to bet by the HCF. This is done to minimize the total amount of coins bet while still ensuring that the amount of coins received back for each outcome will be the same.
5.  Finally, the program checks if the total amount of coins bet is less than the amount of coins received back for each outcome. If it is, the program prints the amounts of coins to bet for each outcome. Otherwise, it prints -1.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
