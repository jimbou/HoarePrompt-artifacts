Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem where you have to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game, such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program first calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all the multipliers, which is the smallest number that is a multiple of all the multipliers. Then, for each outcome, it calculates the amount of coins to bet by dividing the LCM by the multiplier for that outcome.

The program then calculates the highest common factor (HCF) of all the amounts of coins to bet, and divides each amount by the HCF. This is done to minimize the total amount of coins bet, while still ensuring that the total amount is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Finally, the program checks if the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the LCM divided by the HCF. If it is, the program prints out the amounts of coins to bet for each outcome. Otherwise, it prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required.

The program is correct because it correctly calculates the LCM and HCF of the multipliers, and uses these values to determine the amounts of coins to bet for each outcome. The program also correctly checks if the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome, and prints out the correct result.

Correctness: **True**
