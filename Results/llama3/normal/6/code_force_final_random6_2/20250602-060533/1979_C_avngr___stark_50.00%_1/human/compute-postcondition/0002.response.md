To calculate the output state, let's break down the given code and initial state.

Initial State: `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `hcf` is the first element of the list `numbers`, `num` is the second element of the list `numbers`.

The code snippet is:
```
hcf = gcd(hcf, num)
```
Here, `gcd` is a function that calculates the Greatest Common Divisor of two numbers.

Now, let's analyze the impact of the code on the program:

* The value of `hcf` is updated to be the Greatest Common Divisor of its current value (which is the first element of the list `numbers`) and `num` (which is the second element of the list `numbers`).
* The values of `numbers` and `num` remain unchanged.

Since `hcf` is now the Greatest Common Divisor of the first two elements of the list `numbers`, we can express its new value as `gcd(numbers[0], numbers[1])`.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `hcf` is the Greatest Common Divisor of the first two elements of the list `numbers`, `num` is the second element of the list `numbers`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of numbers remains the same, but the value of `hcf` is now the Greatest Common Divisor of the first two elements of the list, and the value of `num` is still the second element of the list.
