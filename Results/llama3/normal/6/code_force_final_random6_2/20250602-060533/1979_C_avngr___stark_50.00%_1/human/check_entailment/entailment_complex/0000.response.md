Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem where you need to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. The program takes the number of outcomes and the multiplier for each outcome as input, calculates the bets for each outcome, and checks if the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program uses a function `func_1` to calculate the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the multipliers for all outcomes. This GCD is used to reduce the bets for each outcome while ensuring that the total amount of coins bet remains less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the bets for each outcome and checks the condition for coming out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. It also handles the case where there is no way to distribute the coins as required and outputs -1 in such cases.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states provided as comments.

Correctness: **True**
