To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for num in numbers[1:]:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `num` and `numbers`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `numbers`. If the list has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `numbers` has at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element of the list `numbers`.

For the loop to be executed one more time, the list `numbers` must have at least 3 elements, and `num` must be the third element of the list `numbers`.

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `hcf` is the Greatest Common Divisor of the first two elements of the list `numbers`, `num` is the third element of the list `numbers`.**
