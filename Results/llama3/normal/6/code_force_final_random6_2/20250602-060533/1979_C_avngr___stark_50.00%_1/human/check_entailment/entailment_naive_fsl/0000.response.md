Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to distribute the coins in such a way that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program first calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all the multipliers, which is the smallest number that is a multiple of all the multipliers. It then calculates the amount of coins to bet on each outcome by dividing the LCM by the multiplier for that outcome. This ensures that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is equal to the LCM.

The program then checks if the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the LCM. If it is, then the program prints the amounts of coins to bet on each outcome. If it is not, then the program prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the case where the multipliers are all equal, the case where the multipliers are all different, and the case where the multipliers are a mix of equal and different values.

The program also correctly handles the case where the number of outcomes is 1, in which case the program prints -1, because there is no way to distribute the coins in such a way that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
