Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: ans_list is a list containing one element which is the value of ans after the code execution, n is a positive integer, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, ans is a[0], res is n - 1, _ is 1, i is n - 1, and dif is a[n - 1] - a[n - 2], stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    dif = a[i + 1] - a[i]
    if dif == 0:
        res -= 1
    if dif != 0:
        if k >= dif * (i + 1):
            ans += dif
            k -= dif * (i + 1)
            res -= 1
        else:
            ans += k // (i + 1)
            if i != 0:
                res += k % (i + 1)
            k = 0
            break
        if k == 0:
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`ans_list` is a list containing one element which is the value of `ans` after the code execution, `n` is at least 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ans` is a[0], `res` is n - 1, `_` is 1, `i` is n - 2. If the difference between a[n - 2] and a[n - 3] is 0, then `res` is updated to n - 2. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. Additionally, if the difference `dif` is not equal to 0, then if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, then `ans` is `a[0] + dif`, `res` is `n - 2`, and `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1) - dif * (i + 1)`. If `k` is less than `dif * (i + 1)`, then `ans` is `a[0] + 0 // (n - 2 + 1)`, `res` is `n - 1 + 0 % (n - 1)`, and `k` is 0. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`ans_list` is a list containing one element which is the value of `ans` after the code execution, `n` is at least 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ans` is `a[0]` plus `dif` if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, otherwise `ans` is `a[0]` plus 0 // (n), `res` is `n - 2` if `dif != 0` and `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, otherwise `res` is `n - 1` if `dif != 0` and `i != 0`, otherwise `res` is `n - 2` if `dif == 0` and `i != 0`, otherwise `res` is `n - 3`, `k` is an integer equal to its original value minus `dif * (i + 1)` if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, otherwise `k` is 0, `_` is 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `dif` is `a[n] - a[n-1]`. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`ans_list` is a list containing one element which is the value of `ans` after the code execution, `n` is at least 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is `n - 1`, `dif` is `a[n-1] - a[n-2]`, `_` is 1. If `dif` is not equal to 0, then if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, `ans` is `a[0]` plus `dif`, `res` is `n - 3`, and `k` is an integer equal to its original value minus `dif * (i + 1)`. Otherwise, `k` is 0, `ans` is `a[0]` plus 0 // (n), and `res` is `n - 2` if `dif != 0` and `i != 0`, otherwise `res` is `n - 3`. If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `dif` is 0, `res` is `n - 3` if `i != 0`, otherwise `res` is `n - 4`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
