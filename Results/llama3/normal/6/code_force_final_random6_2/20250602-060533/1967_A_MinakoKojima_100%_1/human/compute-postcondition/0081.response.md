Postcondition: ***`ans_list` is a list containing one element which is the value of `ans` after the code execution, `n` is at least 3, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ans` is a[0] + k // (n), `res` is n - 1 + k % n if dif != 0 and i != 0, otherwise `res` is n - 2 + k % n, `_` is 1, `i` is n - 1, `dif` is a[n] - a[n-1]***
