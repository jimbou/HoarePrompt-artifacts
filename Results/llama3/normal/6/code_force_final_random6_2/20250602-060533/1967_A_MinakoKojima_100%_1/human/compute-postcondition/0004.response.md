Output State: **`ans_list` is an empty list, `n` is at least 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ans` is the smallest integer in `a`, `res` is `n - 1`, `_` is 0, `i` is 0, `dif` is the difference between the second smallest integer in `a` and the smallest integer in `a`**.

In this output state, the value of `dif` is calculated as the difference between the second smallest integer in `a` and the smallest integer in `a`, since `i` is 0 and `a` is a sorted list of integers. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
