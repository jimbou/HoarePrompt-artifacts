Output State: **`ans_list` is an empty list, `n` is at least 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ans` is the smallest integer in `a` plus `k // (i + 1)`, `res` is `n - 1 + k % (i + 1)`, `_` is 0, the difference between the second smallest integer in `a` and the smallest integer in `a` is not 0, and `k` is less than `dif * (i + 1)`. The current value of `i` is not 0**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to `n - 1 + k % (i + 1)`, which means it has been incremented by the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `n`, `k`, `a`, `ans`, and the difference between the second smallest integer in `a` and the smallest integer in `a` are still valid.
