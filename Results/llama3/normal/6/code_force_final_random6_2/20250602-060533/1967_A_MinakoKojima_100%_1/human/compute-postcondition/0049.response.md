Postcondition: **`ans_list` is an empty list, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-zero integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ans` is the smallest integer in `a` plus the sum of all non-zero differences between consecutive integers in `a` that are less than or equal to `k` divided by the index of the difference plus 1, `res` is the number of non-zero differences between consecutive integers in `a` that are less than or equal to `k` divided by the index of the difference plus 1, `_` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, and the current value of `dif` is `a[n - 1] - a[n - 2]`.**
