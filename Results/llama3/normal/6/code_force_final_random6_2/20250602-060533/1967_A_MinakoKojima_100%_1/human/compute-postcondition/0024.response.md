Output State: **`ans_list` is an empty list, `n` is at least 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `res` is either `n - 2` or `n - 3`, `_` is 0, `i` is 1, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been decremented by 1, so it is now either `n - 2` or `n - 3`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
