Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: ans_list is an empty list, n is a positive integer, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, ans is the smallest integer in a, res is n - 1, _ is 0, stdin contains 0 inputs
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    dif = a[i + 1] - a[i]
    if dif == 0:
        res -= 1
    if dif != 0:
        if k >= dif * (i + 1):
            ans += dif
            k -= dif * (i + 1)
            res -= 1
        else:
            ans += k // (i + 1)
            if i != 0:
                res += k % (i + 1)
            k = 0
            break
        if k == 0:
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`ans_list` is an empty list, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `res` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `_` is 0, `i` is 0. If the difference between the second smallest integer in `a` and the smallest integer in `a` is not 0, then if `k` was previously greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, the previous value of `ans` was the smallest integer in `a` plus `dif`, and the previous value of `k` was the original value of `k` minus `dif` times `i` plus 1. Otherwise, the previous value of `ans` was the smallest integer in `a`, and the previous value of `k` was 0. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the difference between the second smallest integer in `a` and the smallest integer in `a` is 0, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`ans_list` is an empty list, `n` is at least 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `_` is 0, `i` is 1, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`. If `dif` is not 0, then if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, then `ans` is `dif`, `k` is decreased by `dif * (i + 1)`, and `res` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by `k // (i + 1)`, and `k` is set to 0. `res` is either `n - 1`, `n - 2`, `n - 3`, or `n - 4`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `dif` is 0, `res` is either `n - 2` or `n - 3`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`ans_list` is an empty list, `n` is at least 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `_` is 0, `i` is 2, `dif` is `a[3] - a[2]`. If `dif` is not 0, then if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, then `ans` is increased by `dif`, `k` is decreased by `dif * (i + 1)`, and `res` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `k` is set to 0, and `res` is either `n - 3` or `n - 4`. If `dif` is 0, then `res` is either `n - 3` or `n - 4`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
