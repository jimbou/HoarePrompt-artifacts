Output State: **ans_list is a list containing one element which is the value of ans after the code execution, n is a positive integer, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, ans is a[0], res is n - 1, _ is 1, i is n - 1, and dif is a[n - 1] - a[n - 2], stdin is empty**

The code snippet consists of four lines. The first line assigns the values of two integers from stdin to n and k, respectively. The second line assigns a list of integers from stdin to a and sorts it. The third line assigns the first element of the sorted list a to ans. The fourth line assigns n - 1 to res.

After the code execution, the values of n and k are updated to the input values. The list a is sorted and its elements are now in ascending order. The value of ans is updated to the first element of the sorted list a. The value of res is updated to n - 1. The values of _, i, and dif remain unchanged. Stdin is now empty since all inputs have been consumed.
