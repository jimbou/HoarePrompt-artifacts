Postcondition: ***`ans_list` is a list containing two elements, the first element is the original value of `ans`, and the second element is the updated value of `ans` after the code execution. `n` is at least 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `res` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2` or `n - 3` increased by `k % (i + 1)` if `i` is not equal to 0, otherwise `res` remains either `n - 1` or `n - 2` or `n - 3`. `_` is 2, `i` is 2, `dif` is `a[3] - a[2]`, and `ans` is increased by `k // 3`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is either `n - 2` or `n - 3` increased by `k % (i + 1)` if `i` is not equal to 0, otherwise `res` remains either `n - 2` or `n - 3`.***
