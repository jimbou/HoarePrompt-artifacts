Output State: **`ans_list` is an empty list, `n` is at least 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `res` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `_` is 0, `i` is 1, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`, `ans` is increased by `k // (i + 1)`, if `dif` is 0, `res` is either `n - 2` or `n - 3`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `ans_list` is still empty, the value of `n` is still at least 3, the list `a` is still sorted, the value of `res` is still either `n - 1` or `n - 2`, the value of `_` is still 0, the value of `i` is still 1, the value of `dif` is still `a[2] - a[1]`. The value of `ans` has been increased by `k // (i + 1)`. If `dif` is 0, the value of `res` is either `n - 2` or `n - 3`.
