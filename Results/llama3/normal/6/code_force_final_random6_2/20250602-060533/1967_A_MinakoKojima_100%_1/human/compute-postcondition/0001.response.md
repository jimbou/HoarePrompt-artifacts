The only variables in the loop head are variable _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `int(input())`. If `int(input())` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `ans_list` is an empty list does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `int(input())` is greater than 0 and _ is now 0. 
State: **`ans_list` is an empty list, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, _ is 0**
