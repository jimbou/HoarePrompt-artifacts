Postcondition: ***`ans_list` is a list containing one element which is the value of `ans` after the code execution, `n` is at least 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ans` is a[0], `res` is n - 1, `_` is 1, `i` is n - 2. If the difference between a[n - 2] and a[n - 3] is 0, then `res` is updated to n - 2. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. Additionally, if the difference `dif` is not equal to 0, then if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, then `ans` is `a[0] + dif`, `res` is `n - 2`, and `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1) - dif * (i + 1)`. If `k` is less than `dif * (i + 1)`, then `ans` is `a[0] + 0 // (n - 2 + 1)`, `res` is `n - 1 + 0 % (n - 1)`, and `k` is 0. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
