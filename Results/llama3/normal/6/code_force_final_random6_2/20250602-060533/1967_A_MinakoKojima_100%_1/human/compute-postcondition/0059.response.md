Postcondition: ***`ans_list` is a list containing one element which is the value of `ans` after the code execution, `n` is at least 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ans` is a[0], `res` is n - 1, `_` is 1, `i` is n - 2. If the difference between a[n - 2] and a[n - 3] is 0, then `res` is updated to n - 2. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
