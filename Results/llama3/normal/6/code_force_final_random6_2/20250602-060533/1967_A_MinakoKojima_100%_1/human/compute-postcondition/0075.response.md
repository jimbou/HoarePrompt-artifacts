Output State: **`ans_list` is a list containing one element which is the value of `ans` after the code execution, `n` is at least 3, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ans` is a[0], `res` is n - 1, `_` is 1, `i` is n - 1, `dif` is a[n] - a[n-1]**.

In this output state, the value of `dif` is calculated as the difference between the last element and the second last element of the sorted list `a`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
