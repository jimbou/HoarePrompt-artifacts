Postcondition: ***`ans_list` is an empty list, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ans` is the smallest integer in `a` plus the sum of all non-zero differences between consecutive integers in `a` that are less than or equal to `k` divided by the index of the difference plus 1, `res` is the number of non-zero differences between consecutive integers in `a` that are less than or equal to `k` divided by the index of the difference plus 1, `_` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, and `dif` is `a[n - 1] - a[n - 2]`. If `k` is non-zero, `ans` is increased by `k` divided by `n` and `res` is increased by the remainder of `k` divided by `n`.***
