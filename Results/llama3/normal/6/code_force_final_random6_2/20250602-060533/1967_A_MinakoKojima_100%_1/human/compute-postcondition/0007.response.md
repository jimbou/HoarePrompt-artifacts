Postcondition: ***`ans_list` is an empty list, `n` is at least 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ans` is the smallest integer in `a`, `res` is `n - 1`, `_` is 0, `i` is 0, and the difference between the second smallest integer in `a` and the smallest integer in `a` is either 0, meaning the second smallest integer in `a` is equal to the smallest integer in `a` and `res` is `n - 2`, or the difference is not 0***
