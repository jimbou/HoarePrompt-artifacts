The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 2 and `i` is now `n - 2`. 
State: **`ans_list` is a list containing one element which is the value of ans after the code execution, `n` is at least 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ans` is a[0], `res` is n - 1, `_` is 1, `i` is n - 2, and `dif` is a[n - 1] - a[n - 2], stdin is empty**
