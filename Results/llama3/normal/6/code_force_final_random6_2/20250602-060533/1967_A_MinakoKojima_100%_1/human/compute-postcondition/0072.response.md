Postcondition: **`ans_list` is a list containing one element which is the value of `ans` after the code execution, `n` is at least 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers. If the difference between `a[n - 2]` and `a[n - 3]` is 0, then the current value of `res` is `n - 2`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. Additionally, the difference `dif` is not equal to 0. If `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, then `ans` is `a[0] + dif`, `res` is `n - 2`, and `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1) - dif * (i + 1)`. If `k` is less than `dif * (i + 1)`, then `ans` is `a[0] + 0 // (n - 2 + 1)`, `res` is `n - 1 + 0 % (n - 1)`, and `k` is 0. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
