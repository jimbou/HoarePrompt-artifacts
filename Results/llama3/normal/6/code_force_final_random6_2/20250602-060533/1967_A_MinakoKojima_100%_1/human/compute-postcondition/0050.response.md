Output State: **ans_list is an empty list, n is a positive integer, k is a non-zero integer, a is a sorted list of integers, ans is the smallest integer in a plus the sum of all non-zero differences between consecutive integers in a that are less than or equal to k divided by the index of the difference plus 1 plus k divided by n, res is the number of non-zero differences between consecutive integers in a that are less than or equal to k divided by the index of the difference plus 1 plus the remainder of k divided by n, _ is 0, i is n - 1, and dif is a[n - 1] - a[n - 2].**

The code adds the integer division of `k` by `n` to `ans`, and the remainder of `k` divided by `n` to `res`. The values of `ans_list`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `_`, `i`, and `dif` remain unchanged.
