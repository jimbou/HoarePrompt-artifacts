Output State: **ans_list is a list containing two elements, the first element is the value of ans before the code execution, and the second element is the value of ans after the code execution, n is a positive integer, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, ans is a[0], res is n - 1, _ is 2, i is -1, dif is a[n - 1] - a[n - 2], stdin is empty**

In this output state, the values of `ans_list`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `ans`, `res`, `_`, `i`, and `dif` are updated based on the code execution. The `ans_list` still contains two elements, but the second element is now the value of `ans` after the code execution, which is `a[0]`. The `n` and `k` values are updated based on the input. The `a` list is sorted and contains the input integers. The `ans` value is now `a[0]`. The `res` value is updated to `n - 1`. The `_` value remains unchanged at 2. The `i` value remains unchanged at -1. The `dif` value is updated to `a[n - 1] - a[n - 2]`. The `stdin` is now empty as it has been used to input values for `n`, `k`, and `a`.
