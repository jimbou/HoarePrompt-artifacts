To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer, but it does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 2. Additionally, `i` is -1, which is not a valid value for the loop to start, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 0.

State: **`ans_list` is a list containing two elements, the first element is the value of `ans` before the code execution, and the second element is the value of `ans` after the code execution, `n` is at least 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ans` is `a[0]`, `res` is `n - 1`, `_` is 2, `i` is 0, `dif` is `a[n - 1] - a[n - 2]`, `stdin` is empty**
