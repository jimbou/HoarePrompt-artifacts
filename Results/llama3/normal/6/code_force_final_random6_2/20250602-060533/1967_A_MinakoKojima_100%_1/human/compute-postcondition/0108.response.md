Output State: **`ans_list` is a list containing two elements, the first element is the value of `ans` before the code execution, and the second element is the value of `ans` after the code execution, `n` is at least 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ans` is `a[0]`, `res` is `n - 1`, `_` is 2, `i` is 0, `dif` is `a[1] - a[0]`, `stdin` is empty**

In this output state, the value of `dif` has been updated to `a[1] - a[0]`, which is the difference between the second and first elements of the sorted list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
