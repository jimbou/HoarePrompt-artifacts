Postcondition: **`ans_list` is a list containing one element which is the value of `ans` after the code execution, `n` is at least 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ans` is a[0], `res` is n - 1, `_` is 1, `i` is n - 2. If the difference between a[n - 2] and a[n - 3] is 0, then the current value of `res` is n - 2. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. Additionally, the difference `dif` is not equal to 0.**
