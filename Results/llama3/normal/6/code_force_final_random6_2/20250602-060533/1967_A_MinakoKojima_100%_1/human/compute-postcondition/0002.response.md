Output State: **ans_list is an empty list, n is a positive integer, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, ans is the smallest integer in a, res is n - 1, _ is 0, stdin contains 0 inputs**

In this output state, `ans_list` remains an empty list as it is not modified by the code. The values of `n` and `k` are assigned from the input, with `n` being a positive integer as per the precondition. The list `a` is sorted in ascending order, and `ans` is set to the smallest integer in `a`, which is `a[0]`. The variable `res` is calculated as `n - 1`. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0. Stdin is empty as all inputs have been consumed by the code.
