Output State: **`ans_list` is an empty list, `n` is at least 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `_` is 0, `i` is 2, `dif` is `a[3] - a[2]`. If `dif` is not 0, then if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, then `ans` is `dif`, `k` is decreased by `dif * (i + 1)`, and `res` is either `n - 2`, `n - 3`, `n - 4`, or `n - 5`. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by `k // (i + 1)`, and `k` is set to 0. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `dif` is 0, `res` is either `n - 3` or `n - 4**.

In natural language, the output state is: The list `ans_list` is still empty, and the value of `n` is still at least 3. The list `a` is still sorted, and the variable `_` is still 0. The value of `i` is still 2, and the value of `dif` is still the difference between the third and second elements of `a`. The value of `res` has been decreased by 1. If `dif` is not 0, the value of `res` can be `n - 2`, `n - 3`, `n - 4`, or `n - 5`. If `dif` is 0, the value of `res` can be `n - 3` or `n - 4`. The other variables' values are still the same as before.
