Postcondition: ***`ans_list` is a list containing one element which is the value of `ans` after the code execution, `n` is at least 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ans` is a[0] + k // (n - 2 + 1). If the current value of `i` is not 0, then `res` is n - 1 + k % (n - 1) and `i` is n - 2. If the difference between a[n - 2] and a[n - 3] is 0, then the current value of `res` is n - 2 + k % (n - 1). If the current value of `i` is 0, then the postcondition is the same as the precondition.***
