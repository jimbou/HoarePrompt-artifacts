Output State: **`ans_list` is a list containing two elements, the first element is the original value of `ans`, and the second element is the original value of `ans` which is `a[0]`, `n` is at least 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `res` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `_` is 2, `i` is 1, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. The `ans` remains the same as the original value `a[0]` because the break statement does not affect the values of the variables. The `ans_list` contains the original value of `ans` which is `a[0]` as its first element and the same value as its second element because the `ans` did not change.
