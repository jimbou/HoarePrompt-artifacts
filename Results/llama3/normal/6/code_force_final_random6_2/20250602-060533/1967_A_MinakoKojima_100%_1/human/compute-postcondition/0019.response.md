Output State: **`ans_list` is an empty list, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `res` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `_` is 0, `i` is 0, and the difference between the second smallest integer in `a` and the smallest integer in `a` is not 0. The current value of `k` is 0. If `k` was previously greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, then the previous value of `ans` was the smallest integer in `a` plus `dif`, and the previous value of `k` was the original value of `k` minus `dif` times `i` plus 1. Otherwise, the previous value of `ans` was the smallest integer in `a`, and the previous value of `k` was 0. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables do not change, but the program flow is affected by the break statement.
