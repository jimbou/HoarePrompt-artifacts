Output State: **`ans_list` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, where n is a positive integer and k is a non-negative integer. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where each a_i is a positive integer.**

In this output state, `ans_list` is a newly created empty list, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases, each with two lines of input. The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k, where n is a positive integer and k is a non-negative integer. The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where each a_i is a positive integer.
