Postcondition: ***`ans_list` is an empty list, `n` is at least 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `_` is 0, `i` is 1, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, then `ans` is `dif`, `k` is decreased by `dif * (i + 1)`, and `res` is decreased by 1. If `dif` is 0, `res` is either `n - 3` or `n - 4`. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by `k // (i + 1)`, and `k` is set to 0. `res` is either `n - 1`, `n - 2`, `n - 3`, or `n - 4`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
