Postcondition: ***`ans_list` is a list containing two elements, the first element is the value of `ans` before the code execution, and the second element is the value of `ans` after the code execution, `n` is at least 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ans` is `a[0]`, `res` is `n - 1`, `_` is 2, `i` is 0, `dif` is `a[1] - a[0]`, `stdin` is empty. The current value of `dif` is not 0, and `k` is less than `dif * (i + 1)`***
