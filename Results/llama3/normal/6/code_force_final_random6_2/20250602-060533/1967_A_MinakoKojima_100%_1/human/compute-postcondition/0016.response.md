Output State: **ans_list is an empty list, n is at least 2, k is 0, a is a sorted list of integers, ans is the smallest integer in a, res is n - 1, _ is 0, the difference between the second smallest integer in a and the smallest integer in a is not 0.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated to 0, and the value of `ans` has been updated to the smallest integer in `a` since `k` is now 0. The value of `res` has also been updated to `n - 1` since `i` is 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
