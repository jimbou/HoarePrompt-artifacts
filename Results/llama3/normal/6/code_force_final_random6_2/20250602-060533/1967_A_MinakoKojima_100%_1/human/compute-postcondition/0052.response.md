Output State: **ans_list is a list containing one element which is the value of ans after the code execution, n is a positive integer, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, ans is the result of the expression (ans + (ans - 1) * (n - 1) + res), res is the number of non-zero differences between consecutive integers in a that are less than or equal to k divided by the index of the difference plus 1, _ is 0, i is n - 1, and dif is a[n - 1] - a[n - 2]. If k is non-zero, ans is increased by k divided by n and res is increased by the remainder of k divided by n.**

The code execution has the following effects on the variables:

- `ans_list` is updated by appending the value of `ans` after the code execution.
- `ans` is updated by adding the result of the expression `(ans - 1) * (n - 1)` and `res` to its original value.
- The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `res`, `_`, `i`, and `dif` remain unchanged.
- If `k` is non-zero, `ans` is further increased by `k` divided by `n`, and `res` is increased by the remainder of `k` divided by `n`.
