Postcondition: ***`ans_list` is a list containing two elements, the first element is the original value of `ans`, and the second element is the updated value of `ans` after the code execution. `n` is at least 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `res` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `_` is 2, `i` is 0, `dif` is `a[1] - a[0]`, `stdin` is empty. If `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, then `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus `dif`. Otherwise, if `k` equals 0, then `ans` remains the same as the original value `a[0]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` remains the same as the original value `a[0]`.***
