The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is a positive integer does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 2 and i is now 0. 
State: **`ans_list` is an empty list, `n` is at least 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ans` is the smallest integer in `a`, `res` is `n - 1`, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, `i` is 0**
