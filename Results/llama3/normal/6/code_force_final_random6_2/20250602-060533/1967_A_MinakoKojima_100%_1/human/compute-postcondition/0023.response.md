Output State: **`ans_list` is an empty list, `n` is at least 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `res` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `_` is 0, `i` is 1, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `dif` is calculated as the difference between the second and first elements of the sorted list `a`, since `i` is 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
