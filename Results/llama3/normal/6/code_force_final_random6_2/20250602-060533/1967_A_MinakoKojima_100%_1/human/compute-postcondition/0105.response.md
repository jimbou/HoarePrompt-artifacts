The only variable in the loop head is variable _ , so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than the value returned by the int(input()) function, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 1. For the loop to execute again, _ must be increased by 1.
State: **ans_list is a list containing two elements, the first element is the value of ans before the code execution, and the second element is the value of ans after the code execution, n is a positive integer, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, ans is a[0] plus the sum of all the differences between consecutive elements in a if k is greater than or equal to the sum of all the differences between consecutive elements in a times the index of the element plus 1, otherwise ans is a[0] plus the integer division of k by the index of the element plus 1, res is k % n if k is not equal to 0, otherwise res is 0, _ is 2, i is -1, dif is a[n - 1] - a[n - 2]**
