Postcondition: ***`ans_list` is an empty list, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `res` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `_` is 0, `i` is 0, and the difference between the second smallest integer in `a` and the smallest integer in `a` is not 0. If `k` was previously greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, then the previous value of `ans` was the smallest integer in `a` plus `dif`, and the previous value of `k` was the original value of `k` minus `dif` times `i` plus 1. Otherwise, the previous value of `ans` was the smallest integer in `a`, and the previous value of `k` was 0. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
