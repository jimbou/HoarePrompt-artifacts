Postcondition: ***`ans_list` is an empty list, `n` is at least 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ans` is the smallest integer in `a` plus `k // (i + 1)`, `res` is `n - 1` if `i` is 0, otherwise `res` is `n - 1 + k % (i + 1)`, `_` is 0, the difference between the second smallest integer in `a` and the smallest integer in `a` is not 0, and `k` is less than `dif * (i + 1)`.***
