Output State: **`ans_list` is an empty list, `n` is at least 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `res` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2` or `n - 3` or `n - 4`, `_` is 0, `i` is 1, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`, `ans` is increased by `k // (i + 1)`, if `dif` is 0, `res` is either `n - 2` or `n - 3` or `n - 4`.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to include the possibility of `n - 4` because `k % (i + 1)` could be 1, which would increment `res` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
