Postcondition: ***`ans_list` is a list containing one element which is the value of `ans` after the code execution, `n` is at least 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is `n - 1`, `dif` is `a[n-1] - a[n-2]`, `_` is 1. If `dif` is not equal to 0, then if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, `ans` is `a[0]` plus `dif`, `res` is `n - 3`, and `k` is an integer equal to its original value minus `dif * (i + 1)`. Otherwise, `k` is 0, `ans` is `a[0]` plus 0 // (n), and `res` is `n - 2` if `dif != 0` and `i != 0`, otherwise `res` is `n - 3`. If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `dif` is 0, `res` is `n - 3` if `i != 0`, otherwise `res` is `n - 4`.***
