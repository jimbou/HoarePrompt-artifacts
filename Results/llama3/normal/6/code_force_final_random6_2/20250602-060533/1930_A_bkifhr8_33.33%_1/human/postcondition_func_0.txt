This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the results. It expects the input to start with an integer t, representing the number of test cases, followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n, representing the number of pairs, followed by 2n integers. The function calculates the sum of the minimum of each pair of integers for each test case and stores the results in a list. Finally, it prints the results for each test case.
