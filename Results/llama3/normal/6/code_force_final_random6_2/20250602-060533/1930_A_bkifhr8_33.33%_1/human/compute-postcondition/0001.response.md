To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and `t`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `t` is already given to be an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, we can conclude that `t` is indeed at least 1.

The variable `i` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts, so we can set its initial value to 0.

The other variables, `ans_f` and `stdin`, are not directly related to the loop head, so we don't need to adjust their states.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, `ans_f` is an empty list, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `i` is 0**
