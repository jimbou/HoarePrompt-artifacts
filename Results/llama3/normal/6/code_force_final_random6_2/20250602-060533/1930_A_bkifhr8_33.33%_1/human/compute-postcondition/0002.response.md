The code block consists of four lines. The first line initializes a variable `ans` to 0. The second line reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The third line reads a string from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `l`. The fourth line splits the string `l` into a list of substrings separated by spaces and assigns it to the variable `lst`.

After executing the entire code block, the output state is as follows:

Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, ans_f is an empty list, stdin contains t-2 test cases, i is 0, ans is 0, n is an integer, l is a string, lst is a list of substrings**
