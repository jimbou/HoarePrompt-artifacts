The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and list ans_f, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the ans_f.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, ans_f has at least 1 element, i is t. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the i is the second element of the list.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, `ans_f` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `ans_f`, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus `n` * 2 times the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` for each iteration, `l` is a string containing the input string, `n` is an integer, `lst` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, and stdin contains -t test cases, and the value of `i` which is equal to `t` is being printed**
