Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive and greater than n * 2 + 1, ans_f is a list containing the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of lst and its original value plus the original value of ans, i is 0, ans is the original value of ans plus the minimum of the first two elements of lst, l is a string containing the input string, n must be at least 1, lst is a list containing the elements of the input string split by spaces with the first two elements removed, and the length of lst is not equal to 2, stdin contains -2 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `ans_f` also remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `i` remains 0 as it is not affected by the code. The value of `ans` is incremented by the minimum of the first two elements of `lst`, which are removed from the list. The value of `l` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `n` remains at least 1 as it is not affected by the code. The list `lst` has its first two elements removed, and its length is no longer equal to 2. The stdin contains -2 test cases as it is not affected by the code.
