To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` and its original value, `i` is 1, `ans` is 0, `l` is a string containing the input string, `n` must be at least 1, `lst` is a list containing the elements of the input string split by spaces, and `stdin` contains -1 test cases.**
