Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, `ans_f` is an empty list, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `i` is 0, `ans` is the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` and its original value, `l` is a string, `n` must be greater than 0. If the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, `lst` has two fewer elements than before. Otherwise, `lst` has exactly 2 elements.***
