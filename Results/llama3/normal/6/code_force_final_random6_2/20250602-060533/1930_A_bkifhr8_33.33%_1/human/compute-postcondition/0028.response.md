Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, ans_f is a list containing the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of lst and its original value, i is 2, n must be at least 1, l is a string containing the input string, stdin contains -1 test cases, ans is the original value of ans plus the minimum of the first two elements of lst, and lst contains the elements of the input string split by spaces with the first two elements removed.**

In this final state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `ans_f` also remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `i` remains 2 as it is not affected by the code. The value of `n` must still be at least 1 as it is not modified by the code. The value of `l` remains a string containing the input string as it is not affected by the code. The value of `stdin` remains -1 test cases as it is not modified by the code.

The value of `ans` is updated to be the original value of `ans` plus the minimum of the first two elements of `lst`. This is because the first line of the code adds the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` to `ans`.

The value of `lst` is updated to contain the elements of the input string split by spaces with the first two elements removed. This is because the second and third lines of the code remove the first two elements of `lst`.
