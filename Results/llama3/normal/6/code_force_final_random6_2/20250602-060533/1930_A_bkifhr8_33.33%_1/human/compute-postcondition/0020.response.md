Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, ans_f is a list containing the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of lst and its original value, i is n * 2 + 1, ans is 0, l is a string containing the input string, n is an integer, lst is a list containing the elements of the input string split by spaces, and stdin contains -1 test cases.**

Here's a breakdown of the changes:

* The first line sets `ans` to 0, overwriting its original value.
* The second line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`, overwriting its original value. Since stdin contains 0 test cases, this line will consume one test case, leaving -1 test cases in stdin.
* The third line reads a string from stdin and assigns it to `l`, overwriting its original value.
* The fourth line splits the string `l` by spaces and assigns the resulting list to `lst`, overwriting its original empty value.

Note that `t`, `ans_f`, and `i` are not modified by the code, so their values remain the same as in the initial state.
