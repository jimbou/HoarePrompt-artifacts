Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in all cases. The issue lies in the way the program removes elements from the list. The program removes elements at indices 0 and 1 in each iteration, which is not correct. This approach does not guarantee that the minimum of the two numbers is always added to the score.

For example, consider the input:

3
2
1 1 2 1

The program will remove the first two elements (1 and 1) in the first iteration, and then remove the next two elements (2 and 1) in the second iteration. However, the correct approach would be to remove the two smallest numbers (1 and 1) in the first iteration, and then remove the next two smallest numbers (1 and 2) in the second iteration.

A correct approach would be to sort the list in ascending order and then remove the smallest numbers in each iteration. Here is a corrected version of the program:

def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for i in range(t):
        ans = 0
        n = int(input())
        l = input()
        lst = list(map(int, l.split(' ')))
        lst.sort()
        for i in range(n):
            ans += min(lst[2*i], lst[2*i+1])
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)

This corrected program sorts the list in ascending order and then removes the smallest numbers in each iteration, ensuring that the minimum of the two numbers is always added to the score.
