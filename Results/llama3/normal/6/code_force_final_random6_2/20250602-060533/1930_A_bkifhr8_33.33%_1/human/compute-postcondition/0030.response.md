Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` and its original value, `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 1, `l` is a string containing the input string, and `stdin` contains -1 test cases. If the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the minimum of the first two elements of `lst`, and `lst` contains the elements of the input string split by spaces with the first two elements removed. If the length of `lst` is equal to 2, `ans` is the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` and 0, and `lst` remains unchanged.***
