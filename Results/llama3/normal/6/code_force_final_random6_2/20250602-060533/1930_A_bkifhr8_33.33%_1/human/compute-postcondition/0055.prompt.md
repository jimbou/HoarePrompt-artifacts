Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, ans_f is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    ans = 0
    n = int(input())
    l = input()
    lst = l.split(' ')
    for i in range(n * 2):
        if len(lst) != 2:
            ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
            lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
            lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
        else:
            ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
            break
    ans_f.append(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` and its original value, `i` is `n * 2`, `ans` is the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` and its original value, `l` is a string, `n` is an integer, `lst` is an empty list, and stdin contains 0 test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` and its original value plus the original value of `ans`, `i` is `n * 2`, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` for each iteration, `l` is a string containing the input string, `n` is an integer, `lst` is a list containing the elements of the input string split by spaces with all elements removed if the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, and stdin contains -1 test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive and greater than `n` * 2 + 1, `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` and its original value plus the original value of `ans` and the value of `ans` which is the original value of `ans` plus `n` * 2 times the minimum of the first two elements of `lst`, `i` is `n` * 2, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus `n` * 2 times the minimum of the first two elements of `lst`, `l` is a string containing the input string, `n` is an integer, `lst` is an empty list, and stdin contains -1 test cases.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
