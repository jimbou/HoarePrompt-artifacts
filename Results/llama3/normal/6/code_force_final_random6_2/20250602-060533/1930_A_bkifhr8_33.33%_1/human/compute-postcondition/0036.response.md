Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` and its original value plus the original value of `ans`, `i` is `n * 2`, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` for each iteration, `l` is a string containing the input string, `n` is an integer, `lst` is a list containing the elements of the input string split by spaces with all elements removed if the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, and stdin contains -1 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is appended to the list `ans_f`. The values of `t`, `i`, `l`, `n`, and `lst` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains -1 test cases.
