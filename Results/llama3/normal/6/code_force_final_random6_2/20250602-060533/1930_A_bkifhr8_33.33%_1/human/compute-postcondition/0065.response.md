Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, `ans_f` is a list that must have at least `t` elements, `i` is the last element of `ans_f`, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus `n` * 2 times the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` for each iteration, `l` is a string containing the input string, `n` is an integer, `lst` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, and stdin contains -t test cases, and the value of `i` which is equal to `t` is being printed**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will have the same characteristics as the initial state, but with the following changes:

*   `ans_f` will have at least `t` elements, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive.
*   `i` will be the last element of `ans_f`.
*   `ans` will be the original value of `ans` plus `n` * 2 times the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` for each iteration.
*   The value of `i` which is equal to `t` is being printed.

The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body remains unchanged.
