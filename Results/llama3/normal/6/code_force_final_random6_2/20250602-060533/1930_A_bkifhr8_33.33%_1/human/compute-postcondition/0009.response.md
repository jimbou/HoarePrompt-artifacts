To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved accordingly.

The loop head is `for i in range(n * 2):`. The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n * 2`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `n` remains the same.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `i` is 1
* `n` must be greater than 0 (no change)

The other variables in the state (`t`, `ans_f`, `stdin`, `ans`, `l`, `lst`) are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, `ans_f` is an empty list, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `i` is 1, `ans` is the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` and its original value, `l` is a string, `n` must be greater than 0. If the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, `lst` has two fewer elements than before. Otherwise, `lst` has exactly 2 elements.**
