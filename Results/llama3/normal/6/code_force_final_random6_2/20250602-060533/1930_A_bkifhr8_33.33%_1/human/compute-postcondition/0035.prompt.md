Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, ans_f is a list containing the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of lst and its original value, i is n * 2 + 1, ans is 0, l is a string containing the input string, n is an integer, lst is a list containing the elements of the input string split by spaces, and stdin contains -1 test cases.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n * 2):
    if len(lst) != 2:
        ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
        lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
        lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
    else:
        ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` and its original value, `i` is 1, `n` must be at least 1, `l` is a string containing the input string, and `stdin` contains -1 test cases. If the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the minimum of the first two elements of `lst`, and `lst` contains the elements of the input string split by spaces with the first two elements removed. If the length of `lst` is equal to 2, `ans` is the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` and 0, and `lst` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` and its original value, `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 1, `l` is a string containing the input string, and `stdin` contains -1 test cases. If the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the minimum of the first two elements of `lst`, and `lst` contains the elements of the input string split by spaces with the first two elements removed. If the length of `lst` is equal to 2, `ans` is the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` and 0, and `lst` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, ans_f is a list containing the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of lst and its original value, i is 3, n must be at least 2, l is a string containing the input string, stdin contains -1 test cases. If the length of lst is not equal to 2, ans is the original value of ans plus the minimum of the first two elements of lst, and lst contains the elements of the input string split by spaces with the first two elements removed. If the length of lst is equal to 2, ans is the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of lst and 0, and lst remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
