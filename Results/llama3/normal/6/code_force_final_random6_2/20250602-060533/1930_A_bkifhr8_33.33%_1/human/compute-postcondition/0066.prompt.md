You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7).
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for i in range(t):
        ans = 0
        
        n = int(input())
        
        l = input()
        
        lst = l.split(' ')
        
        for i in range(n * 2):
            if len(lst) != 2:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
                lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
            else:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                break
        
        ans_f.append(ans)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` and its original value plus the original value of `ans` and the value of `ans` which is the original value of `ans` plus `n` * 2 times the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` for each iteration, `i` is `t`, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus `n` * 2 times the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` for each iteration, `l` is a string containing the input string, `n` is an integer, `lst` is an empty list, and stdin contains -t test cases.
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, `ans_f` is a list that must have at least `t` elements, `i` is the last element of `ans_f`, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus `n` * 2 times the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` for each iteration, `l` is a string containing the input string, `n` is an integer, `lst` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, and stdin contains -t test cases, and the value of `i` which is equal to `t` is being printed

```

Return Postconditions: `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, `ans_f` is a list that must have at least `t` elements, `i` is the last element of `ans_f`, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus `n` * 2 times the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` for each iteration, `l` is a string containing the input string, `n` is an integer, `lst` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, and stdin contains -t test cases, and the value of `i` which is equal to `t` is being printed


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
