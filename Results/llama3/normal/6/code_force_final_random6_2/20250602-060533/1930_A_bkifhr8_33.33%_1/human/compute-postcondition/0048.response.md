Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive and greater than n * 2 + 1, ans_f is a list containing the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of lst and its original value plus the original value of ans, i is 1, ans is the original value of ans plus the minimum of the first two elements of lst, l is a string containing the input string, n must be at least 1. If the length of lst is not 2, lst has its first two elements removed and stdin contains -2 test cases. If the length of lst is 2, stdin contains -1 test case.***
