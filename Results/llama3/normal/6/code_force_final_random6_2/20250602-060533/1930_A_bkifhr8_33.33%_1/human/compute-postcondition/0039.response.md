To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive and greater than n * 2 + 1, `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of lst and its original value plus the original value of ans, `i` is 0, `ans` is 0, `l` is a string containing the input string, `n` must be at least 1, `lst` is a list containing the elements of the input string split by spaces with all elements removed if the length of lst is not equal to 2, and stdin contains -2 test cases.**
