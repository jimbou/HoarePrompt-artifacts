Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, ans_f is an empty list, stdin contains t-3 test cases, i is 2, ans is the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of lst and its original value. If the length of lst was not equal to 2, ans is increased by the minimum of the first two elements of lst. l is a string, n must be greater than 0, and lst has exactly 2 elements.***
