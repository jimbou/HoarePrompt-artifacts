Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` and its original value plus the original value of `ans` and the value of `ans` which is the original value of `ans` plus `n` * 2 times the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` for each iteration, `i` is `t`, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus `n` * 2 times the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` for each iteration, `l` is a string containing the input string, `n` is an integer, `lst` is an empty list, and stdin contains -t test cases.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed `t` times, and the list `ans_f` contains the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` and its original value plus the original value of `ans` and the value of `ans` which is the original value of `ans` plus `n` * 2 times the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` for each iteration. The variable `i` has reached the value of `t`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations. The variable `ans` contains the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` and its original value plus the original value of `ans` and the value of `ans` which is the original value of `ans` plus `n` * 2 times the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` for each iteration. The variable `l` contains the input string, and `n` is an integer. The list `lst` is empty, and stdin contains -t test cases, indicating that all test cases have been processed.
