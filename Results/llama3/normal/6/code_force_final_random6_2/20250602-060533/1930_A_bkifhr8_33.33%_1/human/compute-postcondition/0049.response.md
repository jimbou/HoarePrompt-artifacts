The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n * 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be at least 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive and greater than n * 2 + 1, ans_f is a list containing the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of lst and its original value plus the original value of ans, i is 2, ans is the original value of ans plus the minimum of the first two elements of lst, l is a string containing the input string, n must be at least 1. If the length of lst is not 2, lst has its first two elements removed and stdin contains -2 test cases. If the length of lst is 2, stdin contains -1 test case.**
