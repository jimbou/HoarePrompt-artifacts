Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive and greater than n * 2 + 1, ans_f is a list containing the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of lst and its original value plus the original value of ans, i is n * 2, ans is the original value of ans plus n * 2 times the minimum of the first two elements of lst, l is a string containing the input string, n is an integer, lst is an empty list, and stdin contains -2 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `t` remains an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive and greater than `n * 2 + 1`, `ans_f` remains a list containing the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` and its original value plus the original value of `ans`, `i` is now `n * 2`, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus `n * 2` times the minimum of the first two elements of `lst`, `l` remains a string containing the input string, `n` remains an integer, `lst` is now an empty list, and `stdin` contains -2 test cases.
