Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive and greater than n * 2 + 1, ans_f is a list containing the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of lst and its original value plus the original value of ans, i is 0, ans is the original value of ans plus the minimum of the first two elements of lst, l is a string containing the input string, n must be at least 1, and stdin contains -1 test cases if the length of lst is 2, otherwise stdin contains -2 test cases and lst has its first two elements removed.***
