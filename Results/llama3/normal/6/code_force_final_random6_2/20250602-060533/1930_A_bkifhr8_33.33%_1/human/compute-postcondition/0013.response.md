To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the loop head variables, which are `i` and `n`. The loop condition is `i in range(n * 2)`, which means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n * 2`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Since `n` is not changed by the loop body, its value remains the same, but it must still be greater than 0 to satisfy the loop condition.

The other variables (`t`, `ans_f`, `stdin`, `ans`, `l`, and `lst`) are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, `ans_f` is an empty list, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `i` is 2, `ans` is the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` and its original value, `l` is a string, `n` must be greater than 0. If the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, `lst` has two fewer elements than before. Otherwise, `lst` has exactly 2 elements and `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases.**
