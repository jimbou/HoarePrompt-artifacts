The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n * 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be at least 2.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` and its original value, `i` is 3, `n` must be at least 2, `l` is a string containing the input string, and `stdin` contains -1 test cases. If the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the minimum of the first two elements of `lst`, and `lst` contains the elements of the input string split by spaces with the first two elements removed. If the length of `lst` is equal to 2, `ans` is the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` and 0, and `lst` remains unchanged.**
