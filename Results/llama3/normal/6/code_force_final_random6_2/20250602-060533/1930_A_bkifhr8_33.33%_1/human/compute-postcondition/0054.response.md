Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive and greater than `n` * 2 + 1, `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` and its original value plus the original value of `ans` and the value of `ans` which is the original value of `ans` plus `n` * 2 times the minimum of the first two elements of `lst`, `i` is `n` * 2, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus `n` * 2 times the minimum of the first two elements of `lst`, `l` is a string containing the input string, `n` is an integer, `lst` is an empty list, and stdin contains -1 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been appended to the list `ans_f`. The values of `t`, `i`, `ans`, `l`, `n`, and `lst` remain unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin has decreased by 1.
