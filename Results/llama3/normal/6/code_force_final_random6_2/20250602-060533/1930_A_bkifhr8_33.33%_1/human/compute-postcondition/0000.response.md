Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, ans_f is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7).**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `t`. Since `t` is between 1 and 5000 inclusive, `t` becomes an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive. The second line initializes `ans_f` as an empty list. No other variables are affected.
