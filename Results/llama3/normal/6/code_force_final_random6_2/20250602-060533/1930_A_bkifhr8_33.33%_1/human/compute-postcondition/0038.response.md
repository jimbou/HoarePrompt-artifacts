Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive and greater than n * 2 + 1, ans_f is a list containing the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of lst and its original value plus the original value of ans, i is n * 2 + 1, ans is 0, l is a string containing the input string, n is an integer, lst is a list containing the elements of the input string split by spaces with all elements removed if the length of lst is not equal to 2, and stdin contains -2 test cases.**

The code first resets the value of `ans` to 0. Then, it reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`. After that, it reads a string from stdin and assigns it to `l`. Finally, it splits the string `l` into a list of elements separated by spaces and assigns it to `lst`. If the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, all elements are removed from `lst`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `i` is not modified by the code, but its value is still `n * 2 + 1` as per the initial state. The value of `ans_f` is not modified by the code, but its value is still a list containing the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` and its original value plus the original value of `ans` as per the initial state. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 2 as two inputs are read from stdin.
