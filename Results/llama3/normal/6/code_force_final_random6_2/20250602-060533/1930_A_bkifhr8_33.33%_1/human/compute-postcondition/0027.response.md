To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n * 2`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.

The state of `n` does not need to be changed, as it is not dependent on the previous iteration.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` and its original value, `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 1, `l` is a string containing the input string, and `stdin` contains -1 test cases. If the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the minimum of the first two elements of `lst`, and `lst` contains the elements of the input string split by spaces with the first two elements removed. If the length of `lst` is equal to 2, `ans` is the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` and 0, and `lst` remains unchanged.**
