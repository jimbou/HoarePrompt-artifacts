Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive and greater than `n` * 2 + 1, `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` and its original value plus the original value of `ans`, `i` is 2, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus twice the minimum of the first two elements of `lst`, `l` is a string containing the input string, `n` must be at least 1. If the length of `lst` was not 2, `lst` is empty and `stdin` contains -2 test cases. Otherwise, `stdin` contains -1 test case.***
