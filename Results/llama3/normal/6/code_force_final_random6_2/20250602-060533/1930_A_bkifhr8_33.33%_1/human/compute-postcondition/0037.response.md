The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n * 2`, `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 and `t` must be greater than `n * 2 + 1`. 
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive and greater than `n * 2 + 1`, `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` and its original value plus the original value of `ans`, `i` is `n * 2 + 1`, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` for each iteration, `l` is a string containing the input string, `n` is an integer, `lst` is a list containing the elements of the input string split by spaces with all elements removed if the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, and stdin contains -1 test cases.**
