To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

Since `i` is initialized to 0, we can keep it as is. However, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

The other variables, `t`, `ans_f`, `stdin`, `ans`, `l`, and `lst`, are not part of the loop head, so we cannot adjust their states.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, `ans_f` is an empty list, `stdin` contains t-2 test cases, `i` is 0, `ans` is 0, `l` is a string, `lst` is a list of substrings, `n` must be greater than 0**
