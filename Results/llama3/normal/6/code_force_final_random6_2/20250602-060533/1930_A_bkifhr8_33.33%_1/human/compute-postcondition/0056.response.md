To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `ans_f`. The loop will execute if `ans_f` has at least one element. 

Since `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` and its original value plus the original value of `ans` and the value of `ans` which is the original value of `ans` plus `n` * 2 times the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` for each iteration, we can infer that `ans_f` will have at least one element if `t` is greater than 0 and `lst` has at least two elements.

However, the state before the loop starts says `lst` is an empty list. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `lst` to have at least two elements.

Additionally, since `i` is `t`, we can infer that `i` will have a value if `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, `ans_f` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `i` is `t`, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus `n` * 2 times the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` for each iteration, `l` is a string containing the input string, `n` is an integer, `lst` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, and stdin contains -t test cases.**
