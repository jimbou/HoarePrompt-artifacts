Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive and greater than n * 2 + 1, ans_f is a list containing the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of lst and its original value plus the original value of ans, i is 2, ans is the original value of ans plus twice the minimum of the first two elements of lst, l is a string containing the input string, n must be at least 1, stdin contains -1 test case.**

In this final state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by twice the minimum of the first two elements of `lst`, as the code executed the line `ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` twice. The value of `ans_f` remains unchanged, as it was not modified by the code. The value of `i` remains 2, as it was not modified by the code. The value of `l` remains unchanged, as it was not modified by the code. The value of `n` remains at least 1, as it was not modified by the code. The value of `t` remains an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive and greater than `n * 2 + 1`, as it was not modified by the code. The stdin now contains -1 test case, as the length of `lst` is 2.
