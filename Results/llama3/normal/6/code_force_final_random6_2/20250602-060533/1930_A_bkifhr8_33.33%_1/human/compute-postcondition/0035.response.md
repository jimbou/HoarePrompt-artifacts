Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, ans_f is a list containing the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of lst and its original value, i is n * 2, ans is the original value of ans plus the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of lst for each iteration, l is a string containing the input string, n is an integer, lst is a list containing the elements of the input string split by spaces with all elements removed if the length of lst is not equal to 2, and stdin contains -1 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `i` has reached its maximum value of `n * 2`, the variable `ans` has accumulated the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` for each iteration, and the list `lst` has been modified by removing all its elements if its length is not equal to 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
