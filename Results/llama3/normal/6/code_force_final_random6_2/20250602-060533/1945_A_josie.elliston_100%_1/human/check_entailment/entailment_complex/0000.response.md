Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate participants in a hike, considering their preferences for living alone, with one other person, or with two others.

Function 1 (`func_1`) calculates the minimum number of tents needed for extroverts and universals. It first checks if the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3. If it's not, it checks if the sum of the remainder of extroverts divided by 3 and universals is less than 3. If it is, the function returns `None`, indicating that it's impossible to accommodate the participants. Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the sum of extroverts and universals divided by 3.

Function 2 (`func_2`) takes into account the number of introverts and calls `func_1` with extroverts and universals as arguments. If `func_1` returns `None`, `func_2` returns -1, indicating that it's impossible to accommodate the participants. Otherwise, it returns the sum of introverts and the result of `func_1`.

The program's logic is correct, and it covers all possible cases:

* If the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3, it checks if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots.
* If there are not enough universals, it returns -1, indicating that it's impossible to accommodate the participants.
* If there are enough universals, it calculates the minimum number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
* It adds the number of introverts to the result, as each introvert needs a separate tent.

Therefore, the program is correct, and it will produce the expected output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
