Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants according to their preferences. The given program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` takes the number of extroverts and universals as input and returns the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate them. It first checks if the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3. If it's not, it checks if the remaining extroverts (i.e., `extroverts % 3`) plus the number of universals is less than 3. If it is, it returns `None`, indicating that it's impossible to accommodate the participants. Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the total number of extroverts and universals divided by 3, which represents the minimum number of tents needed.

`func_2` takes the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals as input and returns the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants. It first calls `func_1` with the number of extroverts and universals as input. If `func_1` returns `None`, it returns -1, indicating that it's impossible to accommodate the participants. Otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of introverts and the result of `func_1`, which represents the minimum number of tents needed.

The program correctly handles the cases where it's impossible to accommodate the participants, such as when there are extroverts left without enough universals to fill the tent. It also correctly calculates the minimum number of tents needed in all other cases.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
