Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, v is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are distinct integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

Explanation:
The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, and each test case starts with an integer `n`, `n` will be an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive. 

The second line initializes a list `v` with `n+1` zeros. 

The third line assigns a new list to `v`, where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the `n` distinct integers from the input, which are between 1 and `n` inclusive. 

Since `t` test cases are provided, after executing the code for one test case, `t-1` test cases remain in stdin.
