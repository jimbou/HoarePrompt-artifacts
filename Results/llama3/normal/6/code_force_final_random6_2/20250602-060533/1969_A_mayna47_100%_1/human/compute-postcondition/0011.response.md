To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 3. Since `n` is at least 2, it must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `v` is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are distinct integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**
