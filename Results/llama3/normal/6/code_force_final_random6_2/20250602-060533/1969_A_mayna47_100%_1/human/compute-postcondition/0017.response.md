Output: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n`, `v` is a list of `n+1` integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are distinct integers between 1 and `n` inclusive, stdin contains `t-1` test cases. If the value at index `v[i]` in the list `v` equals `i` at any point during the loop, then the number 2 is printed and the loop terminates early. Otherwise, the loop completes all iterations without printing anything, and the number 3 is printed**
