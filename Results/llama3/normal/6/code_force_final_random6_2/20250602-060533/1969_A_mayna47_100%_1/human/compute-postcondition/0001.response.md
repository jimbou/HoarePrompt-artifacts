The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 2 and i is now 1. 
State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1,  `v` is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are distinct integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases**
