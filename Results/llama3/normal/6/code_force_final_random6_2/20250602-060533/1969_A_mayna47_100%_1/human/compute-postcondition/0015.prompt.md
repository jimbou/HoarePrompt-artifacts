Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, v is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are distinct integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if v[v[i]] == i:
        print(2)
        return


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1,  `v` is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are distinct integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases, and the value at index `v[i]` in the list `v` is not equal to `i`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is at least 2, `i` is 2,  `v` is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are distinct integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If the value at index `v[i]` in the list `v` equals `i`, then the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `v` is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are distinct integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If the value at index `v[i]` in list `v` is equal to `i`, then the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, no action is taken.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
