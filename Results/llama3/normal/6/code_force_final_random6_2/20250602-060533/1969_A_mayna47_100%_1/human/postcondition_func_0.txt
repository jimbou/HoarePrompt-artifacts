This function reads an integer n and a list of n distinct integers from standard input, then checks if any integer in the list is equal to its index in the list (1-indexed). If a match is found, it prints 2 and returns; otherwise, it prints 3. The function does not modify the input values or store any results, and it does not handle cases where the input is invalid or malformed.
