Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to have at least 2 friends attend the party. The given program attempts to solve this problem.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and their best friends `p_i` in the form of a list `v`.

3. It then checks for each friend `i` if their best friend `v[i]` has `i` as their best friend (`v[v[i]] == i`). If such a pair is found, it prints 2 and returns, as sending invitations to these two friends will result in at least two friends attending the party.

4. If no such pair is found after checking all friends, it prints 3, indicating that at least three invitations are needed to ensure at least two friends attend the party.

The program's logic is correct because:

- If a pair of friends have each other as their best friends, sending invitations to both of them will result in both attending the party, requiring a minimum of 2 invitations.

- If no such pair exists, it means that each friend's best friend is not their best friend's best friend. In this case, sending invitations to any two friends will not result in both attending the party, as one of their best friends will not have an invitation. Therefore, at least three invitations are needed to ensure at least two friends attend the party.

Correctness: **True**
