Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

* The program correctly reads the input values, including the number of test cases `t`, the number of friends `n`, and the list of best friends `p_i`.
* The program uses a 1-indexed array `v` to store the best friends, which is consistent with the problem description.
* The program correctly checks if any integer in the list is equal to its index in the list (1-indexed). If a match is found, it means that two friends are each other's best friends, and sending invitations to both of them will result in at least 2 friends attending the party. In this case, the program prints 2 and returns.
* If no match is found, it means that there are no two friends who are each other's best friends. In this case, the program prints 3, which is the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure that at least 2 friends attend the party.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles the different cases described in the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
