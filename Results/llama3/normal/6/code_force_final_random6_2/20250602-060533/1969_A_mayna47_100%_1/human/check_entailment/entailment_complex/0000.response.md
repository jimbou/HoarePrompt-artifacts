Reasoning:

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states provided as comments. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and a list of `n` distinct integers `p_i` representing the best friends of each friend.
3. The program then checks if any integer in the list `p_i` is equal to its index in the list (1-indexed). If a match is found, it means that the friend and their best friend have a mutual relationship, and Monocarp can send invitations to both of them, resulting in at least 2 friends attending the party. In this case, the program prints 2 and returns.
4. If no match is found, it means that there are no mutual relationships between friends, and Monocarp needs to send invitations to at least 3 friends to ensure that at least 2 friends attend the party. In this case, the program prints 3.

The program correctly handles the cases where there are mutual relationships between friends and where there are no mutual relationships. It also correctly prints the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send in each case.

Correctness: **True**
