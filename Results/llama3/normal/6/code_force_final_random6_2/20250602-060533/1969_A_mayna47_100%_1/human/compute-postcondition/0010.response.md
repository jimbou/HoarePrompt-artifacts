Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `i` is 2,  `v` is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are distinct integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If the value at index `v[i]` in the list `v` equals `i`, then the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
