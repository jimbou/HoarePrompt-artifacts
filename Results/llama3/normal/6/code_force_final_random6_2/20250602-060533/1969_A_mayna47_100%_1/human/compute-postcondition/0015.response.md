Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n`, `v` is a list of `n+1` integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are distinct integers between 1 and `n` inclusive, stdin contains `t-1` test cases. If the value at index `v[i]` in the list `v` equals `i` at any point during the loop, then the number 2 is printed and the loop terminates early. Otherwise, the loop completes all iterations without printing anything.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `n`, and the list `v` will remain unchanged. If at any point during the loop, the value at index `v[i]` in the list `v` equals `i`, the loop will terminate early and print the number 2. If this condition is never met, the loop will complete all its iterations without printing anything. The state of `n` and `stdin` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
