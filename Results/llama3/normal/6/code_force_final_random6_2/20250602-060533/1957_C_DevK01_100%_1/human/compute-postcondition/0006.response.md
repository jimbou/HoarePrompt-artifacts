Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 3, dp is a list containing two elements, the first element is (dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10^9) and the second element is (dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10^9)**

The code block consists of two lines. The first line appends a new element to the end of the list `dp`. This new element is calculated using the last two elements of the list `dp`, the value of `i`, and the modulus operator. The second line removes the first element from the list `dp`. 

After the execution of the code block, the list `dp` contains two elements. The first element is the one that was appended in the first line, and the second element is the last element of the original list `dp`. The value of `n` remains unchanged.
