Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the number of different final configurations possible when continuing the game after k moves. It first calculates the number of remaining valid moves by subtracting the number of moves already made from the total number of moves. If a move is not mirrored by the computer (i.e., r = c), it subtracts 1 from the total number of moves; otherwise, it subtracts 2.

The function func_1(n) calculates the number of different final configurations possible using dynamic programming. It initializes a list dp with the base cases [1, 1] and then iteratively calculates the number of configurations for each remaining move. The formula used is dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2], which represents the number of ways to place a white rook in the current move, considering the possibilities of placing it in a row or column that has not been occupied by a rook yet.

The program correctly handles the modulo operation to avoid large numbers and prints the result modulo 10^9+7.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
