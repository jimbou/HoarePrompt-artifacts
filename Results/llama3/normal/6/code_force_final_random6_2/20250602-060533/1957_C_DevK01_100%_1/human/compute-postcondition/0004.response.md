Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 1, dp is a list containing two elements, the first element is (dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9), the second element is (dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)**

The code block modifies the list `dp` by appending a new element and then removing the first element. The new element is calculated using the last two elements of `dp` and the value of `i`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in the initial state, the value of `i` used in the calculation is `i + 1`. The first element of `dp` is replaced by the newly calculated element, and the second element remains the same. The value of `n` is not affected by the code block.
