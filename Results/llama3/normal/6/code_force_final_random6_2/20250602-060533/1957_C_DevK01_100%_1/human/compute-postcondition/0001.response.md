According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer and `dp` is a list containing two elements, both equal to 1, but this does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 1 and `i` is now 2.
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `dp` is a list containing two elements, both equal to 1, `i` is 2**
