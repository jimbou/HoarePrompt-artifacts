Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 1, dp is a list containing two elements, the first element is 1, the second element is (dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9) where dp[-1] is 1 and i is 2, i is 2**

In this output state, `n` remains unchanged as a positive integer greater than 1. The list `dp` initially contained two elements, both equal to 1. The first line of the code appends a new element to `dp`, which is calculated as `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)`. Since `dp[-1]` is 1 and `i` is 2, this expression simplifies to `(1 + 2 * (2 - 1) * 1) % (7 + 10 ** 9)`, which equals `(1 + 2) % (7 + 10 ** 9)`, resulting in `3 % (7 + 10 ** 9)`. This value is appended to `dp`, making it a list containing three elements: 1, 1, and the calculated value. However, the second line of the code removes the first element of `dp` using `dp.pop(0)`, leaving `dp` with two elements: the original second element (1) and the newly calculated element. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 2.
