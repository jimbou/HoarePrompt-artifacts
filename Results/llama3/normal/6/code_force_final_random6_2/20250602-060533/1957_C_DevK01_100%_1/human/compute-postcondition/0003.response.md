To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the variables in the loop head according to the loop statement.

The loop statement is `for i in range(2, n + 1):`, which means the loop will iterate from `i = 2` to `i = n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is not explicitly stated, but we know that `n` is a positive integer greater than 1. Since the loop iterates from `i = 2` to `i = n`, we can infer that `i` must be less than or equal to `n` at the end of the previous iteration.

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1, so that the loop can execute again. Therefore, `i` should be incremented to `i + 1`.

The state of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

The state of `dp` is not directly related to the loop head, so we don't need to adjust it.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `dp` is a list containing two elements, the first element is 1, the second element is (dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10), `i` is `i + 1`**

Note that we don't know the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, so we can't provide a specific value for `i` in the adjusted state. However, we can express it as `i + 1` to indicate that it has been incremented by 1.
