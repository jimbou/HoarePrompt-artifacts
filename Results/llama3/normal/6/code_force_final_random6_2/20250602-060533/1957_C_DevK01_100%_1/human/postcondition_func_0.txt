Calculates and returns the nth Fibonacci number modulo 10^9 + 7, where n is a positive integer. The function takes no input parameters and returns a single integer value, which is the result of the calculation. The function's purpose is to compute a specific Fibonacci number in a efficient manner, using dynamic programming to store and update only the last two Fibonacci numbers in the sequence.
