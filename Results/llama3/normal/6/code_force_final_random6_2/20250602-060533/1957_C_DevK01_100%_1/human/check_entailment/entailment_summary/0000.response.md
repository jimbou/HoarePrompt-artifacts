Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem involving a chessboard and rooks. The problem requires calculating the number of different final configurations possible when continuing a game after a certain number of moves. The program uses dynamic programming to efficiently compute the result.

The program first reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard (n) and the number of moves already played (k). It then reads the coordinates of each move and updates the size of the chessboard accordingly. If a move is not mirrored by the computer (i.e., the coordinates are the same), it decrements the size of the chessboard by 1; otherwise, it decrements the size by 2.

After processing all moves, the program calls the function `func_1` to calculate the number of possible final configurations. This function uses dynamic programming to compute the nth Fibonacci number modulo 10^9 + 7, where n is the updated size of the chessboard.

The Fibonacci sequence is used to model the number of ways to place rooks on the chessboard such that no two rooks attack each other. The function `func_1` correctly implements this calculation using dynamic programming.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and execution summary, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
