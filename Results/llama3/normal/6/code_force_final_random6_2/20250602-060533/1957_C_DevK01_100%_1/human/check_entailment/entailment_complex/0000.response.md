Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the number of different final configurations possible when continuing the game after k moves. The program uses dynamic programming to efficiently calculate the nth Fibonacci number modulo 10^9 + 7, which represents the number of possible final configurations.

The program first reads the input and initializes the variables n and k. It then iterates over the k moves, updating the value of n based on whether the move is a mirror move or not. After that, it calls the function func_1 with the updated value of n.

The function func_1 calculates the nth Fibonacci number modulo 10^9 + 7 using dynamic programming. It initializes a list dp with the first two Fibonacci numbers and then iteratively calculates the next Fibonacci numbers, updating the list dp accordingly. Finally, it returns the nth Fibonacci number.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
