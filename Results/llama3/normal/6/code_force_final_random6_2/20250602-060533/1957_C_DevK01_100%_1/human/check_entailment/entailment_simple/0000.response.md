Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly calculates the number of possible final configurations of the chessboard after k moves. It does this by iterating over the k moves and updating the number of available rows and columns for the next move.

2. The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible final configurations. The dynamic programming approach is correct because it breaks down the problem into smaller sub-problems (calculating the number of possible configurations for a smaller board) and combines the solutions to these sub-problems to solve the larger problem.

3. The program correctly handles the case where the computer cannot mirror the player's move (i.e., when the player places a rook on a diagonal square). In this case, the program simply decrements the number of available rows and columns by 1.

4. The program correctly calculates the final result modulo 10^9+7 to avoid overflow.

5. The program correctly returns the result of the expression (dp[-1] + 2 * (n - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10^9) as the final answer.

Correctness: **True**
