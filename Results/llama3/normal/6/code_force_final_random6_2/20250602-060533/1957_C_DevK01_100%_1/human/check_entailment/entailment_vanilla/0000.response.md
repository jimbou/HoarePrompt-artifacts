Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the number of different final configurations possible in a game of placing white and black rooks on a chessboard. The game starts with k moves already played, and the task is to continue playing until there are no valid moves remaining.

The program first reads the number of test cases, t. For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard, n, and the number of moves already played, k. It then reads the k moves, each represented by two integers, r and c, denoting the row and column of the move.

The program then calculates the number of remaining valid moves by subtracting 2 from n for each move where r is not equal to c, and subtracting 1 from n for each move where r is equal to c. This is because when r is not equal to c, the computer can mirror the move, resulting in two rooks being placed, while when r is equal to c, the computer cannot mirror the move, resulting in only one rook being placed.

After calculating the number of remaining valid moves, the program calls the function func_1 to calculate the number of different final configurations possible. The function func_1 uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of configurations for each number of remaining valid moves from 1 to n.

The function func_1 initializes a list dp with the base cases for 0 and 1 remaining valid moves. It then iterates from 2 to n, calculating the number of configurations for each number of remaining valid moves using the recurrence relation: dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 * (i-1) * dp[i-2]) % (10^9 + 7). The recurrence relation is derived from the fact that for each remaining valid move, there are two possibilities: either the move is mirrored by the computer, resulting in two rooks being placed, or the move is not mirrored, resulting in only one rook being placed.

Finally, the program prints the result of the function func_1 for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
