#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
    dp = [1, 1]
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        dp += [(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)]
        
        dp.pop(0)
        
    #State: n is a positive integer, dp is a list containing two elements, the first element is (dp[-1] + 2 * (n - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10^9) and the second element is (dp[-1] + 2 * (n - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10^9)
    return dp[-1]
    #The program returns the first element of the list dp, which is the result of the expression (dp[-1] + 2 * (n - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10^9), where n is a positive integer, dp[-1] is the second element of the list dp, and dp[-2] is the first element of the list dp.

#Overall this is what the function does:Calculates and returns the nth Fibonacci number modulo 10^9 + 7, where n is a positive integer. The function takes no input parameters and returns a single integer value, which is the result of the calculation. The function's purpose is to compute a specific Fibonacci number in a efficient manner, using dynamic programming to store and update only the last two Fibonacci numbers in the sequence.
