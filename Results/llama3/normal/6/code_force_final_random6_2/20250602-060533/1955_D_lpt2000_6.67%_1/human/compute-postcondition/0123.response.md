Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer that is less than n and has been incremented by 1, k is an integer, aa is a list of integers that must have at least n elements, bb is a list of integers, cnt_aa is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in aa[:m], cnt_bb is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in bb, D is a Counter object containing the common elements between cnt_aa and cnt_bb, E is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_aa that are not in cnt_bb, C is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_bb that are not in cnt_aa, tot is the sum of D.values(), fnd is 1 if tot is greater than or equal to k, otherwise it is 0, in_aa is the second element in aa[m:], out_aa is the second element in aa[:n - m], D[out_aa] is one less than its original value, C[out_aa] is one more than its original value.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `aa`, `bb`, `cnt_aa`, `cnt_bb`, `E`, `tot`, and `fnd` remain unchanged. The only changes are in the Counter objects `D` and `C`. The value of `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1, and the value of `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1.
