Output State: **`n` is greater than `m`, `m` is greater than 0, `aa` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, `in_aa` is the first element in `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the first element in `aa[:n - m]. If `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0, then `E[out_aa]` is one less than its previous value. Otherwise, `D[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0, `C[out_aa]` is greater than its original value, and `E[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0. Additionally, `C[in_aa]` is less than or equal to 0, and `E[in_aa]` is one more than its previous value.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `aa`, `in_aa`, `out_aa`, `D[out_aa]`, `C[out_aa]`, and `E[out_aa]` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that `E[in_aa]` has been incremented by 1.
