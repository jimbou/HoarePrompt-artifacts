Output State: **`n` is greater than `m`, `m` is greater than 0, `aa` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, `in_aa` is the first element in `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the first element in `aa[:n - m], and D[out_aa] is less than or equal to -1**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `aa`, `in_aa`, and `out_aa` remain unchanged. However, the value of `E[out_aa]` has been decremented by 1, resulting in `D[out_aa]` being less than or equal to -1.
