Output: **n, m, k are integers, aa is a list of at least m integers, bb is a list of integers, cnt_aa is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the first m elements of aa, cnt_bb is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in bb, D is a Counter object containing the common elements and their frequencies between cnt_aa and cnt_bb, E is a Counter object containing the elements and their frequencies in cnt_aa that are not in cnt_bb, C is a Counter object containing the elements and their frequencies in cnt_bb that are not in cnt_aa, tot is an integer equal to the sum of the frequencies of the common elements between aa and bb, fnd is 1 if the total frequency of common elements is greater than or equal to k, otherwise 0, nabors is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0, stdin is empty, in_aa is the last element in aa[m:], out_aa is the last element in aa[:n - m], n is greater than m, and the value of fnd is printed which is either 1 or 0 depending on whether the total frequency of common elements is greater than or equal to k**
