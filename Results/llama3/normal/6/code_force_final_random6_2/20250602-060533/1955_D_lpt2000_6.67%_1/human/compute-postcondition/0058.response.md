Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `m`, `m` is greater than 0, `aa` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements. The current value of `in_aa` is the first element in `aa[m:]` and the current value of `out_aa` is the first element in `aa[:n - m]. If `E[out_aa]` was greater than 0, then `E[out_aa]` is one less than its previous value. Otherwise, `D[out_aa]` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than its original value, and `C[out_aa]` is greater than its original value, and `E[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0.***
