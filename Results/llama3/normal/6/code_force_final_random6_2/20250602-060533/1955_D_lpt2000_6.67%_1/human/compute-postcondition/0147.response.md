Output: **n is an integer, m is an integer that is equal to n, k is an integer, aa is a list of integers that must have at least n elements, bb is a list of integers, cnt_aa is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in aa[:m], cnt_bb is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in bb, D is a Counter object containing the common elements between cnt_aa and cnt_bb, E is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_aa that are not in cnt_bb, C is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_bb that are not in cnt_aa, tot is the sum of D.values(), fnd is 1 if tot is greater than or equal to k, otherwise it is 0, in_aa is the last element in aa[m:], out_aa is the last element in aa[:n - m], and the value of fnd which is 1 if the sum of the common elements between cnt_aa and cnt_bb is greater than or equal to k, otherwise it is 0 is being printed**
