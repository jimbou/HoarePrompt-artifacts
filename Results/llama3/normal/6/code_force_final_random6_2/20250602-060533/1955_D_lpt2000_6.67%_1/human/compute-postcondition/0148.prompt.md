Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `nabors` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two integers m and k (1 <= k <= m), followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6), and then m integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_m (1 <= b_i <= 10^6).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(nabors):
    n, m, k = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    aa = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    bb = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    cnt_aa = Counter(aa[:m])
    cnt_bb = Counter(bb)
    D = cnt_aa & cnt_bb
    E = cnt_aa - D
    C = cnt_bb - D
    tot = sum(D.values())
    fnd = 1 if tot >= k else 0
    for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
        if D[out_aa] > 0:
            if E[out_aa] > 0:
                E[out_aa] -= 1
            else:
                D[out_aa] -= 1
                C[out_aa] += 1
        else:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        if C[in_aa] > 0:
            if C[in_aa] == D[in_aa]:
                C[in_aa] += 1
            else:
                D[in_aa] += 1
        else:
            E[in_aa] += 1
        tot = sum(D.values())
        fnd += 1 if tot >= k else 0
    print(fnd)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n, m, k are integers, aa is a list of at least m integers, bb is a list of integers, cnt_aa is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the first m elements of aa, cnt_bb is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in bb, D is a Counter object containing the common elements and their frequencies between cnt_aa and cnt_bb, E is a Counter object containing the elements and their frequencies in cnt_aa that are not in cnt_bb, C is a Counter object containing the elements and their frequencies in cnt_bb that are not in cnt_aa, tot is an integer equal to the sum of the frequencies of the common elements between aa and bb, fnd is 1 if the total frequency of common elements is greater than or equal to k, otherwise 0, nabors is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0, stdin is empty, in_aa is the last element in aa[m:], out_aa is the last element in aa[:n - m], n is greater than m, and the value of fnd is printed which is either 1 or 0 depending on whether the total frequency of common elements is greater than or equal to k

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is greater than m, m is greater than 0, aa is a list of integers that must have at least n elements, in_aa is the last element in aa[m:], out_aa is the last element in aa[:n - m]. If D[out_aa] is greater than 0, E[out_aa] is decreased by the number of iterations of the loop. Otherwise, D[out_aa] is one less than its original value and C[out_aa] is one more than its original value. If D[out_aa] is not greater than 0, E[out_aa] is decreased by the number of iterations of the loop. If C[in_aa] is greater than 0, then if C[in_aa] is equal to D[in_aa], C[in_aa] is one more than its original value. Otherwise, D[in_aa] is one more than its original value. If C[in_aa] is not greater than 0, E[in_aa] is one more than its original value. tot is the sum of D.values(), fnd is one more than its original value if tot is greater than or equal to k, otherwise it remains the same, and fnd is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer, m is an integer that is equal to n, k is an integer, aa is a list of integers that must have at least n elements, bb is a list of integers, cnt_aa is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in aa[:m], cnt_bb is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in bb, D is a Counter object containing the common elements between cnt_aa and cnt_bb, E is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_aa that are not in cnt_bb, C is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_bb that are not in cnt_aa, tot is the sum of D.values(), fnd is 1 if tot is greater than or equal to k, otherwise it is 0, in_aa is the last element in aa[m:], out_aa is the last element in aa[:n - m], and the value of fnd which is 1 if the sum of the common elements between cnt_aa and cnt_bb is greater than or equal to k, otherwise it is 0 is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
