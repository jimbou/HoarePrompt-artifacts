Output State: **n is greater than m, m is greater than 0, aa is a list of integers that must have at least n + 1 elements, in_aa is the third element in aa[m:], out_aa is the third element in aa[:n - m]. If D[out_aa] is greater than 0, out_aa is decreased by 1 and E[out_aa] is decreased by 1. If D[out_aa] is not greater than 0 but E[out_aa] is greater than 0, D[out_aa] is one less than its original value and C[out_aa] is one more than its original value. If neither D[out_aa] nor E[out_aa] is greater than 0, out_aa is decreased by 1 and E[out_aa] is decreased by 1. If C[in_aa] is greater than 0, then if C[in_aa] equals D[in_aa], C[in_aa] is one more than its original value. Otherwise, D[in_aa] is one more than its original value. If C[in_aa] is not greater than 0, E[in_aa] is one more than its original value. tot is the sum of all values in dictionary D. fnd is one more than its original value if tot is greater than or equal to k, otherwise it remains unchanged.**
