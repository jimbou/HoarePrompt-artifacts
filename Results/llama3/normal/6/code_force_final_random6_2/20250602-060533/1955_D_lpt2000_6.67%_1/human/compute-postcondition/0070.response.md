Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `m`, `m` is greater than 0, `aa` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, `in_aa` is the first element in `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the first element in `aa[:n - m]. If `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0, then `E[out_aa]` is one less than its previous value. Otherwise, `D[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0, `C[out_aa]` is greater than its original value, and `E[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0. Additionally, if `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0, then if `C[in_aa]` is equal to `D[in_aa]`, `C[in_aa]` is equal to `D[in_aa]` plus 1. Otherwise, `C[in_aa]` is not equal to `D[in_aa]`, and `D[in_aa]` is one more than its previous value. If `C[in_aa]` is less than or equal to 0, then `E[in_aa]` is one more than its previous value.***
