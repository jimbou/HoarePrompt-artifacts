Output State: **n is greater than m, m is greater than 0, aa is a list of integers that must have at least n elements. The current value of in_aa is the first element in aa[m:] and the current value of out_aa is the first element in aa[:n - m]. The current value of D[out_aa] is greater than or equal to 0 and less than its original value. C[out_aa] is greater than its original value. E[out_aa] is less than or equal to 0.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `D[out_aa]` and `C[out_aa]`. The first line decrements the value of `D[out_aa]` by 1, making it greater than or equal to 0 and less than its original value. The second line increments the value of `C[out_aa]` by 1, making it greater than its original value. No other variables are affected.
