Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `m`, `m` is greater than 0, `aa` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements. The current value of `in_aa` is the first element in `aa[m:]` and the current value of `out_aa` is the first element in `aa[:n - m]. The current value of `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0. Additionally, the current value of `E[out_aa]` is greater than 0.***
