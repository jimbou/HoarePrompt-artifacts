Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers, `aa` is a list of at least `m` + 3 integers, `bb` is a list of integers, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the common elements and their frequencies between `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `E` is a Counter object containing the elements and their frequencies in `cnt_aa` that are not in `cnt_bb`, where `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `C` is a Counter object containing the elements and their frequencies in `cnt_bb` that are not in `cnt_aa`, `tot` is an integer equal to the sum of the frequencies of the common elements between `aa` and `bb`, `fnd` is 1 if the total frequency of common elements is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise 0, `nabors` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `in_aa` is the third element in `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the third element in `aa[:n - m]`, `n` is greater than `m`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the frequency of `out_aa` in `E` has been decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
