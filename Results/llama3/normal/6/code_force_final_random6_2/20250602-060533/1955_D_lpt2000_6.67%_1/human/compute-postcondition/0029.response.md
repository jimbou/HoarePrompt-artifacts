Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers, `aa` is a list of at least `m` integers, `bb` is a list of integers, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the common elements and their frequencies between `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `E` is a Counter object containing the elements and their frequencies in `cnt_aa` that are not in `cnt_bb`, `C` is a Counter object containing the elements and their frequencies in `cnt_bb` that are not in `cnt_aa` and `C[in_aa]` is one more than its original value, `tot` is an integer equal to the sum of the frequencies of the common elements between `aa` and `bb`, `fnd` is 1 if the total frequency of common elements is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise 0, `nabors` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `in_aa` is the second element in `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the second element in `aa[:n - m]`, `n` is greater than `m`.**

In this output state, the value of `C[in_aa]` has been increased by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged.
