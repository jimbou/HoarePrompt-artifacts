The value of E[out_aa] is decreased by 1. The value of out_aa is the second element in aa[:n - m]. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is greater than m, m is greater than 0, aa is a list of integers that must have at least n + 1 elements, in_aa is the second element in aa[m:], out_aa is the second element in aa[:n - m], and E[out_aa] is decreased by 1.

Output State: **n is greater than m, m is greater than 0, aa is a list of integers that must have at least n + 1 elements, in_aa is the second element in aa[m:], out_aa is the second element in aa[:n - m], and E[out_aa] is decreased by 1.**
