Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, aa is a list of integers that must have at least n elements, bb is a list of integers, cnt_aa is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in aa[:m], cnt_bb is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in bb, D is a Counter object containing the common elements between cnt_aa and cnt_bb, E is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_aa that are not in cnt_bb, C is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_bb that are not in cnt_aa, tot is the sum of D.values(), fnd is 1 if tot is greater than or equal to k, otherwise it is 0
Code of the loop:
for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
    if D[out_aa] > 0:
        if E[out_aa] > 0:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        else:
            D[out_aa] -= 1
            C[out_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[out_aa] -= 1
    if C[in_aa] > 0:
        if C[in_aa] == D[in_aa]:
            C[in_aa] += 1
        else:
            D[in_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[in_aa] += 1
    tot = sum(D.values())
    fnd += 1 if tot >= k else 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer, m is an integer that is less than n, k is an integer, aa is a list of integers that must have at least n elements, bb is a list of integers, cnt_aa is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in aa[:m], cnt_bb is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in bb, D is a Counter object containing the common elements between cnt_aa and cnt_bb, E is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_aa that are not in cnt_bb, C is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_bb that are not in cnt_aa, tot is the sum of D.values(), fnd is 1 if tot is greater than or equal to k, otherwise it is 0, in_aa is the first element in aa[m:], out_aa is the first element in aa[:n - m]. If D[out_aa] is greater than 0, then the value of D[out_aa] is greater than 0 and the value of E[out_aa] is 0. Otherwise, the value of D[out_aa] is one less than its original value and C[out_aa] is one more than its original value. If E[out_aa] is greater than 0, then the value of D[out_aa] is greater than 0 and the value of E[out_aa] is 0. Otherwise, the count of out_aa in D is 0, and the count of out_aa in E is decreased by 1. If C[in_aa] is greater than 0, then the value of C[in_aa] is equal to the value of D[in_aa] plus 1. Otherwise, the count of in_aa in D is increased by 1 and the count of in_aa in C is 0 and the count of in_aa in E is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer, m is an integer that is less than n and has been incremented by 1, k is an integer, aa is a list of integers that must have at least n elements, bb is a list of integers, cnt_aa is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in aa[:m], cnt_bb is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in bb, D is a Counter object containing the common elements between cnt_aa and cnt_bb, E is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_aa that are not in cnt_bb, C is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_bb that are not in cnt_aa, tot is the sum of D.values(), fnd is 1 if tot is greater than or equal to k, otherwise it is 0, in_aa is the second element in aa[m:], out_aa is the second element in aa[:n - m].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer, m is an integer that is less than n and has been incremented by 2, k is an integer, aa is a list of integers that must have at least n elements, bb is a list of integers, cnt_aa is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in aa[:m], cnt_bb is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in bb, D is a Counter object containing the common elements between cnt_aa and cnt_bb, E is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_aa that are not in cnt_bb, C is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_bb that are not in cnt_aa, tot is the sum of D.values(), fnd is 1 if tot is greater than or equal to k, otherwise it is 0, in_aa is the third element in aa[m:], out_aa is the third element in aa[:n - m]. If the count of out_aa in D is greater than 0, then the count of out_aa in D is decremented by 1 and the count of out_aa in C is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the count of out_aa in E is decreased by 1. If C[in_aa] equals D[in_aa], then the count of in_aa in C is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the count of in_aa in D is incremented by 1. If C[in_aa] is greater than 0, then the count of in_aa in C is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the count of in_aa in E is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
