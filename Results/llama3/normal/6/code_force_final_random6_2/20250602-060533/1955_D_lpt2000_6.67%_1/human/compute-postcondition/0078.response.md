Output State: **`n` is greater than `m`, `m` is greater than 0, `aa` is a list of integers that must have at least `n + 1` elements, `in_aa` is the second element in `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the second element in `aa[:n - m]`. If `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `D[out_aa]` is one less than its original value and `C[out_aa]` is one more than its original value. If `D[out_aa]` is not greater than 0, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. `C[in_aa]` is one more than its original value.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `aa`, `in_aa`, and `out_aa` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that `C[in_aa]` is incremented by 1. The conditions related to `D[out_aa]` and `E[out_aa]` are still valid, but they do not affect the value of `C[in_aa]`.
