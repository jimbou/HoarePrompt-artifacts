The value of E[out_aa] is decreased by 1. The value of out_aa is the second element in aa[:n - m]. The values of the other variables are not affected. The value of n is still greater than m, and m is still greater than 0. The list aa still has at least n + 1 elements. The value of in_aa is still the second element in aa[m:]. The value of E[out_aa] is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `m`, `m` is greater than 0, `aa` is a list of integers that must have at least `n + 1` elements, `in_aa` is the second element in `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the second element in `aa[:n - m]`, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1.**
