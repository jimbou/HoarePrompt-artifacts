Based on the initial state, the `print(fnd)` statement will print the value of `fnd`, which is either 1 or 0.

`fnd` is 1 if the total frequency of common elements between `aa` and `bb` is greater than or equal to `k`, and 0 otherwise. The total frequency of common elements is stored in the variable `tot`, which is the sum of the frequencies of the common elements between `aa` and `bb`.

Since the exact values of `k` and `tot` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `fnd`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output either 1 or 0, indicating whether the total frequency of common elements is greater than or equal to `k`.

Output: **1 if the total frequency of common elements is greater than or equal to k, otherwise 0**
