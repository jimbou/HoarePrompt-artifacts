Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that is less than `n` and has been incremented by 2, `k` is an integer, `aa` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, `bb` is a list of integers, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in `aa[:m]`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the common elements between `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `E` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_aa` that are not in `cnt_bb`, `C` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_bb` that are not in `cnt_aa`, `tot` is the sum of `D.values()`, `fnd` is 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise it is 0, `in_aa` is the third element in `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the third element in `aa[:n - m]`, and the count of `out_aa` in `E` is decreased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the count of `out_aa` in `E` has been decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
