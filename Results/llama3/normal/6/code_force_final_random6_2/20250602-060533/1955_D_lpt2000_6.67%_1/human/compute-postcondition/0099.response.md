State: **n is greater than m, m is greater than 0, aa is a list of integers that must have at least n elements, in_aa is the last element in aa[m:], out_aa is the last element in aa[:n - m], D[out_aa] is one less than its original value, C[out_aa] is one more than its original value, E[out_aa] is decreased by the number of iterations of the loop, C[in_aa] is one more than its original value, D[in_aa] is one more than its original value, E[in_aa] is one more than its original value, tot is the sum of D.values(), fnd is one more than its original value if tot is greater than or equal to k, otherwise it remains the same**
