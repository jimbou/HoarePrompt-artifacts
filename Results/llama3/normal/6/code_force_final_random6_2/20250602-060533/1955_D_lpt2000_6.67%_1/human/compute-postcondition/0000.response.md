Output State: **`nabors` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two integers m and k (1 <= k <= m), followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6), and then m integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_m (1 <= b_i <= 10^6).**

In this output state, the value of `nabors` is an integer that was read from the input, which is the first integer of a test case. The remaining input still contains multiple test cases, each with two integers m and k, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, and then m integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_m.
