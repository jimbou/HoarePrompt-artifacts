Postcondition: ***n is greater than m, m is greater than 0, aa is a list of integers that must have at least n + 1 elements, in_aa is the second element in aa[m:], out_aa is the second element in aa[:n - m]. If D[out_aa] is greater than 0, E[out_aa] is decreased by 1. Otherwise, D[out_aa] is one less than its original value and C[out_aa] is one more than its original value. If D[out_aa] is not greater than 0, E[out_aa] is decreased by 1.***
