Output State: **`n` is greater than `m`, `m` is greater than 0, `aa` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements. The current value of `in_aa` is the first element in `aa[m:]` and the current value of `out_aa` is the first element in `aa[:n - m]. The current value of `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0. Additionally, the current value of `E[out_aa]` is one less than its previous value which was greater than 0.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `aa`, `in_aa`, `out_aa`, and `D[out_aa]` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is in the value of `E[out_aa]`, which is now one less than its previous value, which was greater than 0.
