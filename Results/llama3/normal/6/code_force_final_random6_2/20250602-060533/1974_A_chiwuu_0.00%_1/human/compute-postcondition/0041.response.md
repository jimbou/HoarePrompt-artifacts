Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t1` is an integer, if t is divisible by 5, t1 is equal to (2 * second_input_integer * 3) - b * 4. Otherwise, t1 is equal to (2 * second_input_integer * 3) // 5 * 3 + 15 - b * 4.**

The code `t = t` does not change the values of any variables. It simply assigns the value of `t` to itself, which does not have any effect on the program state. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.
