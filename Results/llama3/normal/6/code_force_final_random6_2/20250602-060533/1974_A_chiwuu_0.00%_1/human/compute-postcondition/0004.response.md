The code `t = t // 5` divides the current value of `t` by 5 and assigns the result back to `t`. Since the current value of `t` is divisible by 5, the result of the division will be an integer.

The initial state states that `t` is equal to 2 times the value of `b`, so we can write `t` as `2b`. Since `t` is divisible by 5, we know that `2b` is also divisible by 5.

After the division, the new value of `t` will be `2b // 5`. Since `2b` is divisible by 5, we can simplify this expression to `2b / 5`.

The other variables `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` are not affected by the code, so their values remain the same.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t` is equal to 2b / 5, which is an integer.**
