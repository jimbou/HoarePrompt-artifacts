Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t1` is an integer, if t is divisible by 5, then `t1` is equal to 2b * 3 - b * 4, which is an integer and divisible by 5. Otherwise, `t1` is equal to (2 times the value of b) * 3 // 5 * 15 + 15 - b * 4 and `t1` is not divisible by 5. Additionally, `t1` is less than `a`, `t2` is an integer and is equal to `a - t1`.**

In this output state, the value of `t2` is calculated as the difference between `a` and `t1`. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions on `t1` are still valid, and `t2` is an integer.
