This function reads a series of pairs of integers from standard input, calculates a value based on the second integer of each pair, and prints the calculated value. The calculation involves multiplying the second integer by 2, dividing by 5, and adjusting the result based on whether the division is exact or not. If the calculated value is less than the first integer of the pair, the function further adjusts the result by adding a multiple of 15. The function repeats this process for each pair of integers in the input, printing the final calculated value for each pair.
