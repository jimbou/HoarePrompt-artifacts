Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately calculates the minimum number of screens needed to accommodate the given number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It first calculates the number of screens needed to accommodate the 2x2 icons. Since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, it calculates the number of screens needed as `b * 2` (where `b` is the number of 2x2 icons). If this number is not a multiple of 5, it adds 1 to the result to account for the remaining cells.

2. It then calculates the remaining cells on the screens allocated for the 2x2 icons. Since each screen has 15 cells, it calculates the remaining cells as `t * 15 - b * 4` (where `t` is the number of screens allocated for the 2x2 icons).

3. If the remaining cells are sufficient to accommodate the 1x1 icons, it returns the number of screens allocated for the 2x2 icons. Otherwise, it calculates the additional screens needed to accommodate the remaining 1x1 icons.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible cases. It takes into account the fact that each screen has 15 cells and that each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells. It also correctly calculates the remaining cells on the screens allocated for the 2x2 icons and the additional screens needed to accommodate the remaining 1x1 icons.

Therefore, the program is correct, and it will produce the correct output for all possible inputs.
