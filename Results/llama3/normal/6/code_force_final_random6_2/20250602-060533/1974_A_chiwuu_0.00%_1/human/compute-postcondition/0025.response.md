Postcondition: ***n is greater than 1, i is 1, a is an integer equal to the first input integer, b is an integer equal to the second input integer, t1 is an integer, stdin is empty. If 2 times the second input integer is divisible by 5, then t is an integer equal to 2 times the second input integer divided by 5. Otherwise, t is an integer equal to (2 * b) // 5 + 1.***
