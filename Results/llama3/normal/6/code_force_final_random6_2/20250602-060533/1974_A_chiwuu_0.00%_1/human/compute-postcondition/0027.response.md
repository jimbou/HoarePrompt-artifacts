Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer equal to the first input integer, `b` is an integer equal to the second input integer, if 2 times the second input integer is divisible by 5, then `t1` is an integer equal to 6 times the second input integer divided by 5 minus 4 times the second input integer. Otherwise, `t1` is an integer equal to 3 times the second input integer - 4 times the second input integer + 15, `t` is equal to `t1`.**

The code does not change the values of `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, or `t1`. It only assigns the value of `t1` to `t`, so the output state includes the same information as the initial state, with the addition of the value of `t`.
