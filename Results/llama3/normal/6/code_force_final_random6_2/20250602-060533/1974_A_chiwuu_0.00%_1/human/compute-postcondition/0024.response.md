The value of `t` is updated to be the integer division of `t` by 5 plus 1. Since `t` is equal to 2 times the second input integer, we can express `t` as `2 * b`. Therefore, the new value of `t` is `(2 * b) // 5 + 1`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer equal to the first input integer, `b` is an integer equal to the second input integer, `t1` is an integer, `t` is an integer equal to `(2 * b) // 5 + 1`, stdin is empty.**
