Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t1` is an integer, if t is divisible by 5, t1 is equal to (2 * second_input_integer * 3) - b * 4. Otherwise, t1 is equal to (2 * second_input_integer * 3) // 5 * 3 + 15 - b * 4, `t2` is equal to `a` minus `t1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: `n` is still greater than 2, `i` is still 2, `a` and `b` are still integers, and `t1` is still an integer with its value depending on whether `t` is divisible by 5 or not. Additionally, a new variable `t2` is introduced, which is equal to the difference between `a` and `t1`.
