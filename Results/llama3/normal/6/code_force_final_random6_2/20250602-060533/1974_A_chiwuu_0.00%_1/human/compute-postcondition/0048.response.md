Output: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t1` is an integer. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t1` is equal to (2 * second_input_integer * 3) - `b` * 4 if `t` is divisible by 5, otherwise `t1` is equal to (2 * second_input_integer * 3) // 5 * 3 + 15 - `b` * 4. If `t1` is less than `a`, then `t2` is equal to `a` minus `t1`, and if `t2` is divisible by 15, `t` is equal to `t` plus `t2` divided by 15, otherwise `t` is equal to `t` plus (`a` minus `t1`) divided by 15 plus 1, and the value of `t` is being printed**
