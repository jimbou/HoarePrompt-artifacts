Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains t+1 inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) and then t pairs of integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99).
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = input().split()
        
        a = int(a)
        
        b = int(b)
        
        t = b * 2
        
        if t % 5 == 0:
            t = t // 5
        else:
            t = t // 5 + 1
        
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        
        print(t)
        
    #State: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t1` is an integer. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t1` is equal to 2b * 3 - b * 4 if `t` is divisible by 5, or (2 times the value of b) * 3 // 5 * 15 + 15 - b * 4 if `t` is not divisible by 5. If `t1` is less than `a`, then `t2` is an integer and is equal to `a - t1`. If `t2` is divisible by 15, then `t` is equal to `t + t2 // 15`. Otherwise, `t` is equal to `t + t2 // 15 + 1` and is an integer. After the update of `t`, if `t` is divisible by 5, then `t1` is equal to 2b * 3 - b * 4, which is an integer and divisible by 5. Otherwise, `t1` is equal to (2 times the value of b) * 3 // 5 * 15 + 15 - b * 4 and `t1` is not divisible by 5, and the value of `t` is printed

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a series of pairs of integers from standard input, calculates a value based on the second integer of each pair, and prints the calculated value. The calculation involves multiplying the second integer by 2, dividing by 5, and adjusting the result based on whether the division is exact or not. If the calculated value is less than the first integer of the pair, the function further adjusts the result by adding a multiple of 15. The function repeats this process for each pair of integers in the input, printing the final calculated value for each pair.
