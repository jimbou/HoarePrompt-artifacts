Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. `t = t // 5 + 1`:
	* `t` is assigned a new value, which is the result of the expression `t // 5 + 1`.
	* Since `t` is initially equal to 2 times the second input integer, we can substitute this expression into the equation: `t = (2 * second_input_integer) // 5 + 1`.
	* The `//` operator performs integer division, which means it rounds down to the nearest whole number. So, the result of `t // 5` will be an integer.
	* Adding 1 to the result of `t // 5` gives us the new value of `t`.

Now, let's update the output state:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t` is equal to `(2 * second_input_integer) // 5 + 1`**

Note that the values of `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the code. Only the value of `t` is updated.
