Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `n` pairs of integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a, b = input().split()
    a = int(a)
    b = int(b)
    t = b * 2
    if t % 5 == 0:
        t = t // 5
    else:
        t = t // 5 + 1
    t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
    if t1 >= a:
        t = t
    else:
        t2 = a - t1
        if t2 % 15 == 0:
            t = t + t2 // 15
        else:
            t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
    print(t)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t1` is an integer. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t1` is equal to 2b * 3 - b * 4 if `t` is divisible by 5, or (2 times the value of b) * 3 // 5 * 15 + 15 - b * 4 if `t` is not divisible by 5. If `t1` is less than `a`, then `t2` is an integer and is equal to `a - t1`. If `t2` is divisible by 15, then `t` is equal to `t + t2 // 15`. Otherwise, `t` is equal to `t + t2 // 15 + 1` and is an integer. After the update of `t`, if `t` is divisible by 5, then `t1` is equal to 2b * 3 - b * 4, which is an integer and divisible by 5. Otherwise, `t1` is equal to (2 times the value of b) * 3 // 5 * 15 + 15 - b * 4 and `t1` is not divisible by 5, and the value of `t` is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer equal to the first input integer, `b` is an integer equal to the second input integer. If 2 times the second input integer is divisible by 5, then `t1` is an integer equal to 6 times the second input integer divided by 5 minus 4 times the second input integer. Otherwise, `t1` is an integer equal to 3 times the second input integer - 4 times the second input integer + 15. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t` is equal to `t1`. Otherwise, `t2` is an integer equal to the first input integer minus 6 times the second input integer divided by 5 plus 4 times the second input integer if 2 times the second input integer is divisible by 5, or `t2` is an integer equal to the first input integer minus 3 times the second input integer plus 4 times the second input integer minus 15 otherwise. If `t2` is divisible by 15, then `t` is an integer equal to the sum of its previous value and `t2` divided by 15. Otherwise, `t` is an integer equal to `t` plus `t2` divided by 15 plus 1. The value of `t` is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t1` is an integer. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t1` is equal to (2 * second_input_integer * 3) - `b` * 4 if `t` is divisible by 5, otherwise `t1` is equal to (2 * second_input_integer * 3) // 5 * 3 + 15 - `b` * 4. If `t1` is less than `a`, then `t2` is equal to `a` minus `t1`, and if `t2` is divisible by 15, `t` is equal to `t` plus `t2` divided by 15, otherwise `t` is equal to `t` plus (`a` minus `t1`) divided by 15 plus 1, and the value of `t` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
