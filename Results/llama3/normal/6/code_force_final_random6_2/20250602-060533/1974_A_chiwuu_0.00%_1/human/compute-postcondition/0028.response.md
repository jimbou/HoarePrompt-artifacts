Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer equal to the first input integer, `b` is an integer equal to the second input integer, if 2 times the second input integer is divisible by 5, then `t1` is an integer equal to 6 times the second input integer divided by 5 minus 4 times the second input integer and `t2` is an integer equal to the first input integer minus 6 times the second input integer divided by 5 plus 4 times the second input integer. Otherwise, `t1` is an integer equal to 3 times the second input integer - 4 times the second input integer + 15 and `t2` is an integer equal to the first input integer minus 3 times the second input integer plus 4 times the second input integer minus 15.**
