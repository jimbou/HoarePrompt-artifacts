Output State: **n is greater than 0, i is 0, a is an integer, b is an integer, t is equal to (2 times the value of b) // 5 + 1 and t is not divisible by 5**

In this output state, the value of t has been updated to be equal to (2 times the value of b) // 5 + 1. The values of the other variables, n, i, a, and b, remain unchanged. Note that t is still not divisible by 5, as the division by 5 and the addition of 1 do not change this property.
