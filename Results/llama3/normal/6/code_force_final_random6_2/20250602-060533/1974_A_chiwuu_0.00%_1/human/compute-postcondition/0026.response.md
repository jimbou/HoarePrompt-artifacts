Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer equal to the first input integer, `b` is an integer equal to the second input integer, if 2 times the second input integer is divisible by 5, then `t1` is an integer equal to 6 times the second input integer divided by 5 minus 4 times the second input integer. Otherwise, `t1` is an integer equal to 3 times the second input integer - 4 times the second input integer + 15.**

In this output state, the value of `t1` is updated based on the value of `t`, which depends on whether 2 times the second input integer is divisible by 5. If it is, then `t1` is calculated as 6 times the second input integer divided by 5 minus 4 times the second input integer. If it's not, then `t1` is calculated as 3 times the second input integer minus 4 times the second input integer plus 15. The values of `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
