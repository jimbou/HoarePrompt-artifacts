Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t1` is an integer. If `t` is divisible by 5, `t1` is equal to (2 * second_input_integer * 3) - `b` * 4. Otherwise, `t1` is equal to (2 * second_input_integer * 3) // 5 * 3 + 15 - `b` * 4. `t2` is equal to `a` minus `t1`. If `t2` is divisible by 15, `t` is equal to `t` plus `t2` divided by 15. Otherwise, `t` is equal to `t` plus (`a` minus `t1`) divided by 15 plus 1.***
