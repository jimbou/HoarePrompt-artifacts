Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer equal to the first input integer, `b` is an integer equal to the second input integer, if 2 times the second input integer is divisible by 5, then `t1` is an integer equal to 6 times the second input integer divided by 5 minus 4 times the second input integer, `t2` is an integer equal to the first input integer minus 6 times the second input integer divided by 5 plus 4 times the second input integer, and `t` is an integer equal to `t` plus `t2` divided by 15 plus 1. Otherwise, `t1` is an integer equal to 3 times the second input integer - 4 times the second input integer + 15, `t2` is an integer equal to the first input integer minus 3 times the second input integer plus 4 times the second input integer minus 15, and `t` is an integer equal to `t` plus `t2` divided by 15 plus 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only change being the value of `t`, which is updated based on the value of `t2` and the initial value of `t`. The values of `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The values of `t1` and `t2` are also unchanged, but their expressions are still dependent on the initial conditions.
