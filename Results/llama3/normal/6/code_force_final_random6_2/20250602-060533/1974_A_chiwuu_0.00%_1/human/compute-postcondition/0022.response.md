The code snippet reads two space-separated integers from the input, assigns them to `a` and `b`, and then calculates `t` as twice the value of `b`. 

Output State: **n is greater than 1, i is 1, a is an integer equal to the first input integer, b is an integer equal to the second input integer, t1 is an integer, t is an integer equal to 2 times the second input integer, stdin is empty.**
