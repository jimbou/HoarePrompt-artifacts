Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It accurately implements the logic to determine the minimum number of screens needed to place the application icons. Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program correctly reads the input pairs of integers, representing the number of 1x1 icons (a) and 2x2 icons (b).
2.  It calculates the minimum number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons by multiplying b by 2 (since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells), dividing by 5 (since each screen has 15 cells), and rounding up if necessary (using the `//` operator for integer division and adding 1 if there's a remainder).
3.  It then calculates the remaining space on the screens allocated for 2x2 icons, which is `t * 15 - b * 4`. This represents the space left for 1x1 icons.
4.  If the remaining space is sufficient to accommodate all 1x1 icons (i.e., `t1 >= a`), the program uses the already calculated value of `t` as the minimum number of screens needed.
5.  If the remaining space is insufficient, the program calculates the additional screens needed for the 1x1 icons by subtracting the remaining space from the total number of 1x1 icons (`t2 = a - t1`), dividing by 15 (since each screen has 15 cells), and rounding up if necessary (using the `//` operator for integer division and adding 1 if there's a remainder). This value is added to the initial value of `t` to get the final minimum number of screens needed.
6.  The program correctly prints the calculated minimum number of screens needed for each input pair.

Correctness: **True**
