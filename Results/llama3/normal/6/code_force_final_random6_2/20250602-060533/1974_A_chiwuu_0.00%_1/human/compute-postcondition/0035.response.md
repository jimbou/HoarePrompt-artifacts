State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer equal to the first input integer, `b` is an integer equal to the second input integer. If 2 times the second input integer is divisible by 5, then `t1` is an integer equal to 6 times the second input integer divided by 5 minus 4 times the second input integer. Otherwise, `t1` is an integer equal to 3 times the second input integer - 4 times the second input integer + 15. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t` is equal to `t1`. Otherwise, `t2` is an integer equal to the first input integer minus 6 times the second input integer divided by 5 plus 4 times the second input integer if 2 times the second input integer is divisible by 5, or `t2` is an integer equal to the first input integer minus 3 times the second input integer plus 4 times the second input integer minus 15 otherwise. If `t2` is divisible by 15, then `t` is an integer equal to the sum of its previous value and `t2` divided by 15. Otherwise, `t` is an integer equal to `t` plus `t2` divided by 15 plus 1. The value of `t` is being printed.**
