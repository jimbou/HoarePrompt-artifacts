Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t1` is an integer. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t1` is equal to 2b * 3 - b * 4 if `t` is divisible by 5, or (2 times the value of b) * 3 // 5 * 15 + 15 - b * 4 if `t` is not divisible by 5. If `t1` is less than `a`, then `t2` is an integer and is equal to `a - t1`. If `t2` is divisible by 15, then `t` is equal to `t + t2 // 15`. Otherwise, `t` is equal to `t + t2 // 15 + 1` and is an integer. After the update of `t`, if `t` is divisible by 5, then `t1` is equal to 2b * 3 - b * 4, which is an integer and divisible by 5. Otherwise, `t1` is equal to (2 times the value of b) * 3 // 5 * 15 + 15 - b * 4 and `t1` is not divisible by 5, and the value of `t` is printed**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the output state after the loop executes 3 times, with the only difference being that `n` is greater than or equal to 0, and `i` is equal to `n`. This means that the loop has executed `n` times, and the final values of `a`, `b`, `t1`, and `t` are the same as the values after the third iteration. The loop has finished executing, and the final value of `t` is printed.
