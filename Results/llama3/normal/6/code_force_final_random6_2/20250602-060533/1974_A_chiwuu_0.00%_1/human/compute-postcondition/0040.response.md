Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t1` is an integer, if t is divisible by 5, t1 is equal to (2 * second_input_integer * 3) - b * 4. Otherwise, t1 is equal to (2 * second_input_integer * 3) // 5 * 3 + 15 - b * 4.**

In this output state, the value of `t1` is calculated based on the value of `t`, which depends on whether it is divisible by 5 or not. If `t` is divisible by 5, `t1` is calculated as `(2 * second_input_integer * 3) - b * 4`. Otherwise, `t1` is calculated as `(2 * second_input_integer * 3) // 5 * 3 + 15 - b * 4`. The values of `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
