Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t1` is an integer, if t is divisible by 5, t1 is equal to (2 * second_input_integer * 3) - b * 4. Otherwise, t1 is equal to (2 * second_input_integer * 3) // 5 * 3 + 15 - b * 4, `t2` is equal to `a` minus `t1`, `t` is equal to `t` plus `t2` divided by 15.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been updated by adding the result of `t2` divided by 15 to its previous value. The values of `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `t1`, and `t2` remain unchanged. The relationship between `t1` and the input integers, as well as the relationship between `t2` and `a` and `t1`, are still valid.
