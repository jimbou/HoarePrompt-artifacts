Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer equal to the first input integer, `b` is an integer equal to the second input integer, if 2 times the second input integer is divisible by 5, then `t1` is an integer equal to 6 times the second input integer divided by 5 minus 4 times the second input integer, `t2` is an integer equal to the first input integer minus 6 times the second input integer divided by 5 plus 4 times the second input integer, and `t` is an integer equal to the sum of its previous value and `t2` divided by 15. Otherwise, `t1` is an integer equal to 3 times the second input integer - 4 times the second input integer + 15, `t2` is an integer equal to the first input integer minus 3 times the second input integer plus 4 times the second input integer minus 15, and `t` is an integer equal to the sum of its previous value and `t2` divided by 15.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows:

The value of `n` remains greater than 1, and the value of `i` remains 1. The values of `a` and `b` remain equal to the first and second input integers, respectively. The values of `t1` and `t2` depend on whether 2 times the second input integer is divisible by 5. If it is, then `t1` and `t2` are calculated based on the first and second input integers, and `t` is updated by adding `t2` divided by 15 to its previous value. If 2 times the second input integer is not divisible by 5, then `t1` and `t2` are calculated based on different expressions involving the first and second input integers, and `t` is updated by adding `t2` divided by 15 to its previous value.
