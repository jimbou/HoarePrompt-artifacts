The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0. 
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
