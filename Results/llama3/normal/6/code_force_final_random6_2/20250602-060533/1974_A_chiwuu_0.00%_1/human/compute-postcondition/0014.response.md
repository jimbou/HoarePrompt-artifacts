Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t1` is an integer, if `t` is divisible by 5, then the current value of `t1` is equal to 2b * 3 - b * 4, which is an integer and divisible by 5. Otherwise, the current value of `t1` is equal to (2 times the value of `b`) * 3 // 5 * 15 + 15 - `b` * 4 and `t1` is not divisible by 5. Additionally, the current value of `t1` is less than `a`, `t2` is an integer and is equal to `a - t1`. The current value of `t2` is divisible by 15, `t` is equal to `t + t2 // 15`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` has been updated by adding the integer division of `t2` by 15 to it. The values of `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `t1`, and `t2` remain unchanged. The relationship between `t1` and `a` is still valid, and `t2` is still equal to `a - t1` and is divisible by 15.
