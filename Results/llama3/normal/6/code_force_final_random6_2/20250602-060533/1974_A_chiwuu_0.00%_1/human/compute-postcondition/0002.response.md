Output State: **n is greater than 0, i is 0, a is an integer, b is an integer, t is an integer equal to 2 times the value of b**

The code snippet first reads two space-separated inputs from stdin and assigns them to `a` and `b`. It then converts these inputs to integers. The third line calculates the value of `t` as twice the value of `b`. The initial values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
