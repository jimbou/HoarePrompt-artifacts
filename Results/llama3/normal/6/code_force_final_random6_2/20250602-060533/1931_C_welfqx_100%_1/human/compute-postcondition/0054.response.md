The code prints the difference between the value of `n` and the maximum value between `cn` and `ck`. 

Here, `n` is greater than 1, `cn` is the length of the longest prefix of `num` where all elements are equal plus the value of `ck`, and `ck` is either `n - 1` or less than `n - 1`. If the first element of `num` is equal to the last element of `num`, then the length of the longest prefix of `num` where all elements are equal is increased by the value of `ck`. Otherwise, no changes are made.

Output: **n - max(cn, ck) (where n is greater than 1, cn is the length of the longest prefix of num where all elements are equal plus the value of ck, and ck is either n - 1 or less than n - 1)**
