The only variable in the loop head is variable `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n`, `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again `j` must be `n - 1` and `n` must be greater than `n - 1 + 1` or `n` must be greater than `n`. Since `n` cannot be greater than `n`, `n` must be greater than `n - 1 + 1` is not possible. However, `n` can be equal to `n - 1 + 1` or `n` is equal to `n`. So `n` is equal to `n` and `j` is `n - 1`.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `r` is either 2 or 1, `n` is greater than 2, `num` is a list of `n` positive integers less than or equal to `n`, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the first element of `num`, `stdin` contains `t-4` inputs: for each test case, first an integer `n` and then a list of `n` integers, `i` is `n`, `ck` is either 1 or greater than 1 and less than or equal to `n`, `cn` is either `n` or less than `n` and greater than 1 and is equal to `cn + ck`, `ii` is `n - 1`. If `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]`, then `f` is set to 0. Otherwise, `f` remains unchanged.**
