Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `r` is either 2 or 1, `n` is greater than `n`, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of `n` positive integers less than or equal to `n`, `j` is `n`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the first element of `num`, `stdin` contains `t-4` inputs: for each test case, first an integer `n` and then a list of `n` integers. If `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, then `i` is `n - 1`, `ck` is 1, and `cn` is 2. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `i` is `n - 1`, `ck` is 1, `cn` is 1, and `ii` is `n - 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains `t-4` inputs.
