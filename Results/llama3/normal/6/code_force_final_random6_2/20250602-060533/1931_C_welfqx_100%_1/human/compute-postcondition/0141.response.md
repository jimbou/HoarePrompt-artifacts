Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `r` is either 2 or 1, `n` is greater than `n+1`, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of `n+1` positive integers less than or equal to `n+1`, `j` is `n+1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the first element of `num`, `stdin` contains `t-4` inputs: for each test case, first an integer `n+1` and then a list of `n+1` integers. If `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, then `i` is `n`, `ck` is 1, and `cn` is 4. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `i` is `n`, `ck` is 1, `cn` is 3, and `ii` is `n`.**

The value of `cn` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cn` was either 2 or 3. Therefore, the new value of `cn` is either 3 or 4. The other variables remain unchanged.
