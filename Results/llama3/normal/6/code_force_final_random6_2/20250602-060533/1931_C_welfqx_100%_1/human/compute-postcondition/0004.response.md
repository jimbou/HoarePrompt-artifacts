Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of `n` positive integers less than or equal to `n`, `j` is 0, stdin contains `t-1` inputs: for each test case, first an integer `n` and then a list of `n` integers. The current value of `num[j]` is not equal to the current value of `num[j + 1]`.***
