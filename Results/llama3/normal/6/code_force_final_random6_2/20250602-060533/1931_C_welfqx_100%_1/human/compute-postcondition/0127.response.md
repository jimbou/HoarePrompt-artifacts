Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 2, r is either 2 or 1, n is either 1 or greater than 2, f is either 0 or 1, num is a list of n positive integers less than or equal to n, j is n, onum is a reversed copy of num, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the first element of num, stdin contains t-5 inputs: for each test case, first an integer n and then a list of n integers, i is n, ck is either 1 or greater than 1 and less than or equal to n, cn is either n or less than n and greater than 1 and is equal to cn + ck, ii is n - 1, and we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. The values of all variables remain the same, and the stdin still contains t-5 inputs. The only change is that we move to the next iteration of the loop.
