To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for ii in range(n - 1):`, so we can only adjust the state of `ii` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `ii` and `n`. If `ii` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ii` is `n - 2` and `n` is greater than 1.

For the loop to execute again, `ii` must be incremented by 1, so `ii` becomes `n - 1`. The value of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of n positive integers less than or equal to n, `j` is n - 1, `onum` is a reversed copy of num, `symb1` is the first element of num, `symb2` is the last element of num, `stdin` contains t-1 inputs: for each test case, first an integer n and then a list of n integers, `i` is n - 2, `cn` is the length of the longest prefix of num where all elements are equal, `ii` is n - 1, `ck` is 1 if `onum[ii]` is equal to `onum[ii + 1]`, otherwise it is not defined**
