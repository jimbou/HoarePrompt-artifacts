To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0, meaning `n` must be at least 2. Since `n` is already greater than 2, we don't need to adjust it. However, we need to adjust `i` to be within the range of `n - 1`. Since `i` is currently `n`, we need to adjust it to be `n - 1` for the loop to execute.

State: **t is a positive integer greater than 2, r is either 2 or 1, n is greater than 2, f is 1, num is a list of n positive integers less than or equal to n, j is n, onum is a reversed copy of num, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the first element of num, stdin contains t-4 inputs: for each test case, first an integer n and then a list of n integers, i is n - 1, ck is 1, cn is 1, ii is n - 1**
