Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, r is 1, n is greater than 1, f is 1, num is a list of n positive integers less than or equal to n, j is n - 1, onum is a reversed copy of num, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the last element of num, stdin contains t-3 inputs: for each test case, first an integer n and then a list of n integers, i is n - 2, cn is the length of the longest prefix of num where all elements are equal plus the value of ck, ii is n - 1, ck is either n - 1 or less than n - 1. If the first element of num is equal to the last element of num, then the length of the longest prefix of num where all elements are equal is increased by the value of ck. Otherwise, no changes are made, and the difference between n and the maximum of cn and ck is being printed.**

The code block consists of three lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. The second line sets `f` to 1. The third line assigns a list of integers from the input to `num`. 

The first line affects `n` and `stdin`. The value of `n` becomes the integer value of the input, and `stdin` now contains `t-3` inputs. 

The second line affects `f`. The value of `f` becomes 1.

The third line affects `num`. The value of `num` becomes a list of `n` positive integers less than or equal to `n`. 

No other variables are affected.
