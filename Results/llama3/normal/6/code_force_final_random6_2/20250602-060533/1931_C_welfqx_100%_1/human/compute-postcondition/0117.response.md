To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `n - 1`, so for the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `r` is either 2 or 1, `n` is greater than 2, `f` is either 0 or 1, `num` is a list of `n` positive integers less than or equal to `n`, `j` is `n`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the first element of `num`, `stdin` contains `t-4` inputs: for each test case, first an integer `n` and then a list of `n` integers, `i` is `n`, `ck` is either 1 or greater than 1 and less than or equal to `n`, `cn` is either `n` or less than `n` and greater than 1 and is equal to `cn + ck`, `ii` is `n - 1`. If `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]`, then `f` is set to 0. Otherwise, `f` remains unchanged.**
