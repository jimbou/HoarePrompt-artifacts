Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r` is either 1 or 0, `n` is 1, `f` is either 1 or 0, `num` is a list of `n` positive integers less than or equal to `n`, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `stdin` contains `t-3` inputs: for each test case, first an integer `n` and then a list of `n` integers, `i` is `n - 2`, `cn` is the length of the longest prefix of `num` where all elements are equal plus the value of `ck`, `ii` is `n - 1`, `ck` is either `n - 1` or less than `n - 1`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains `t-3` inputs.
