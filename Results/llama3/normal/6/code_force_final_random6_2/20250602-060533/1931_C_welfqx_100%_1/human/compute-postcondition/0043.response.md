Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of n positive integers less than or equal to n, `j` is n - 1, `onum` is a reversed copy of num, `symb1` is the first element of num, `symb2` is the last element of num, `stdin` contains t-1 inputs: for each test case, first an integer n and then a list of n integers, `i` is n - 2, `cn` is the length of the longest prefix of num where all elements are equal, `ii` is n - 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. The variables `t`, `r`, `n`, `f`, `num`, `j`, `onum`, `symb1`, `symb2`, `stdin`, `i`, `cn`, and `ii` maintain their initial values.
