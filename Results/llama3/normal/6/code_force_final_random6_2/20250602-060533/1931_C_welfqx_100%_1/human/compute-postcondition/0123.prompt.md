Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than 2, r is either 2 or 1, n is greater than 2, f is 1, num is a list of n positive integers less than or equal to n, j is n - 1, onum is a reversed copy of num, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the first element of num, stdin contains t-4 inputs: for each test case, first an integer n and then a list of n integers, i is n - 1, ck is either 1 or greater than 1 and less than or equal to n, cn is either n or less than n and greater than 1 and is equal to cn + ck, ii is n - 2.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n - 1):
    if num[j] != num[j + 1]:
        f = 0
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is a positive integer greater than 2, r is either 2 or 1, n is greater than 2, f is either 0 or 1, num is a list of n positive integers less than or equal to n, j is n - 1, onum is a reversed copy of num, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the first element of num, stdin contains t-4 inputs: for each test case, first an integer n and then a list of n integers, i is n - 1, ck is either 1 or greater than 1 and less than or equal to n, cn is either n or less than n and greater than 1 and is equal to cn + ck, ii is n - 2. If num[j] is not equal to num[j + 1], then f is set to 0. Otherwise, f remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `r` is either 2 or 1, `n` is greater than 2, `num` is a list of `n` positive integers less than or equal to `n`, `j` is `n`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the first element of `num`, `stdin` contains `t-4` inputs: for each test case, first an integer `n` and then a list of `n` integers, `i` is `n`, `ck` is either 1 or greater than 1 and less than or equal to `n`, `cn` is either `n` or less than `n` and greater than 1 and is equal to `cn + ck`, `ii` is `n - 1`. If `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]`, then `f` is set to 0. Otherwise, `f` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than 2, r is either 2 or 1, n is greater than 2, num is a list of n positive integers less than or equal to n, j is n - 1, onum is a reversed copy of num, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the first element of num, stdin contains t-4 inputs: for each test case, first an integer n and then a list of n integers, i is n, ck is either 1 or greater than 1 and less than or equal to n, cn is either n or less than n and greater than 1 and is equal to cn + ck, ii is n - 1. If num[j] is not equal to num[j + 1], then f is set to 0. Otherwise, f remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
