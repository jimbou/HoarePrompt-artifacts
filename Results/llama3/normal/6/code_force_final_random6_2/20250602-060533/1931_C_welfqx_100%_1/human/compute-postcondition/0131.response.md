Postcondition: **t is a positive integer greater than 2, r is either 2 or 1, n is greater than 2, f is 1, num is a list of n positive integers less than or equal to n, j is n, onum is a reversed copy of num, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the first element of num, stdin contains t-4 inputs: for each test case, first an integer n and then a list of n integers, i is n - 1, ck is 1, cn is 1, ii is n - 1. The current value of num[i] is equal to num[i + 1].**
