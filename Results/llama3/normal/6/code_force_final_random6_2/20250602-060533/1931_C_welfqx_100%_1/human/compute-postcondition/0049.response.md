Output State: `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of n positive integers less than or equal to n, `j` is n - 1, `onum` is a reversed copy of num, `symb1` is the first element of num, `symb2` is the last element of num, `stdin` contains t-1 inputs: for each test case, first an integer n and then a list of n integers, `i` is n - 2, `cn` is the length of the longest prefix of num where all elements are equal, `ii` is n - 1. If the elements at index `ii` and `ii + 1` in `onum` are equal, then `ck` is n - 1. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement and `ck` is the length of the longest prefix of `onum` where all elements are equal.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for all variables except `ii` and `ck`. The value of `ii` will be `n - 1`, and the value of `ck` will be either `n - 1` if all elements in `onum` are equal, or the length of the longest prefix of `onum` where all elements are equal if the elements at index `ii` and `ii + 1` in `onum` are not equal.
