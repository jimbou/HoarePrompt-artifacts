The only variable in the loop head is variable `r` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `r` and `t`. If `r` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `r` is 0, `t` is a positive integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `r` is increased by 1 so `r` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of n positive integers less than or equal to n, `j` is n - 1, `onum` is a reversed copy of num, `symb1` is the first element of num, `symb2` is the last element of num, `stdin` contains t-2 inputs: for each test case, first an integer n and then a list of n integers, `i` is n - 2, `cn` is the length of the longest prefix of num where all elements are equal plus the value of ck, `ii` is n - 1, `ck` is either n - 1 or less than n - 1. If the first element of num is equal to the last element of num, then the length of the longest prefix of num where all elements are equal is increased by the value of ck. Otherwise, no changes are made, and the difference between n and the maximum of cn and ck is being printed.**
