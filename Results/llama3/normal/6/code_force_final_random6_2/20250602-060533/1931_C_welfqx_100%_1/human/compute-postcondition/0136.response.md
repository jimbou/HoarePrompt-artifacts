The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is `n` and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than `n`.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `r` is either 2 or 1, `n` is greater than `n`, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of `n` positive integers less than or equal to `n`, `j` is `n`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the first element of `num`, `stdin` contains `t-4` inputs: for each test case, first an integer `n` and then a list of `n` integers. If `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, then `i` is `n - 1`, `ck` is 1, and `cn` is 2. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `i` is `n - 1`, `ck` is 1, `cn` is 1, and `ii` is `n - 1**
