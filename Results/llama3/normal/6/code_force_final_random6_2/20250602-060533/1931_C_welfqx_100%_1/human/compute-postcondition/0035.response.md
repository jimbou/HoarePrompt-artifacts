The only variables in the loop head are variables  ii and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `ii` and `n`. If n is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, t is a positive integer greater than 0, r is 0, n is at least 2, f is 1, num is a list of n positive integers less than or equal to n, j is n - 1, onum is a reversed copy of num, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the last element of num, stdin contains t-1 inputs: for each test case, first an integer n and then a list of n integers, i is n - 2, cn is the length of the longest prefix of num where all elements are equal, and if num[i] is not equal to num[i + 1], then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 1 and ii is now 0. 
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of n positive integers less than or equal to n, `j` is n - 1, `onum` is a reversed copy of num, `symb1` is the first element of num, `symb2` is the last element of num, `stdin` contains t-1 inputs: for each test case, first an integer n and then a list of n integers, `i` is n - 2, `cn` is the length of the longest prefix of num where all elements are equal, `ii` is 0**
