Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer n and then a list of n integers. The integers are positive and less or equal to n.
Code of the loop:
for r in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    f = 1
    num = [int(_) for _ in input().split()]
    for j in range(n - 1):
        if num[j] != num[j + 1]:
            f = 0
            break
    if n == 1 or f == 1:
        print(0)
        continue
    onum = num.copy()
    onum.reverse()
    cn = 1
    ck = 1
    f = 1
    symb1 = num[0]
    symb2 = onum[0]
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if num[i] == num[i + 1]:
            cn += 1
        else:
            break
    for ii in range(n - 1):
        if onum[ii] == onum[ii + 1]:
            ck += 1
        else:
            break
    if symb1 == symb2:
        cn += ck
    print(n - max(cn, ck))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of n positive integers less than or equal to n, `j` is n - 1, `onum` is a reversed copy of num, `symb1` is the first element of num, `symb2` is the last element of num, `stdin` contains t-1 inputs: for each test case, first an integer n and then a list of n integers, `i` is n - 2, `cn` is the length of the longest prefix of num where all elements are equal plus the value of ck, `ii` is n - 1, `ck` is either n - 1 or less than n - 1. If the first element of num is equal to the last element of num, then the length of the longest prefix of num where all elements are equal is increased by the value of ck. Otherwise, no changes are made, and the difference between n and the maximum of cn and ck is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r` is either 1 or 0, `n` is greater than 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of `n` positive integers less than or equal to `n`, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the first element of `num`, `stdin` contains `t-3` inputs: for each test case, first an integer `n` and then a list of `n` integers, `i` is `n - 1`, `ck` is either 1 or greater than 1 and less than or equal to `n`, `cn` is either `n` or less than `n` and greater than 1 and is equal to `cn + ck`, `ii` is `n - 2`. If all elements of the reversed list `onum` are equal, then `ck` is equal to `n - 1`. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, then `symb1` is equal to `symb2`. and the difference between `n` and the maximum of `cn` and `ck` is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is a positive integer greater than 2, r is either 2 or 1, n is greater than 2, f is 1, num is a list of n positive integers less than or equal to n, j is n, onum is a reversed copy of num, stdin contains t-4 inputs: for each test case, first an integer n and then a list of n integers, i is n-1, ck is either 1 or greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to n-1, cn is greater than or equal to 1 plus ck, and ii is n-1. If the current value of onum[ii] is equal to the current value of onum[ii + 1], then ck is greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to n-1. Otherwise, ck is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the first element of num is equal to the first element of num, then cn is greater than or equal to 1 plus ck. The value of n minus the maximum of cn and ck is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
