Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `r` is either 2 or 1, `n` is greater than 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of `n` positive integers less than or equal to `n`, `j` is `n`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the first element of `num`, stdin contains `t-4` inputs: for each test case, first an integer `n` and then a list of `n` integers, `i` is `n-1`, `ck` is 1, `cn` is greater than or equal to 1, and `ii` is at least 1. The element at index `ii` of `onum` is not equal to the element at index `ii+1` of `onum`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains `t-4` inputs. The relationship between the elements of `onum` at indices `ii` and `ii+1` also remains the same.
