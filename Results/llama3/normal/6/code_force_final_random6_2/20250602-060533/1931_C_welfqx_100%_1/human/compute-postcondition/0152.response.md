Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `r` is either 2 or 1, `n` is greater than 3, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of `n+1` positive integers less than or equal to `n+1`, `j` is `n+1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the first element of `num`, `stdin` contains `t-4` inputs: for each test case, first an integer `n+1` and then a list of `n+1` integers, `i` is `n`, `ck` is either 2 or 3, `cn` is greater than or equal to 1, and `ii` is `n`**

In this output state, the value of `ck` has been incremented by 1, so it is now either 2 or 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
