Output: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, r is 0, n is a positive integer, f is 0 if there are at least two different elements in num, otherwise f is 1, num is a list of n positive integers less than or equal to n, j is n - 1, stdin contains t-1 inputs: for each test case, first an integer n and then a list of n integers. The current value of n is either 1 or the current value of f is 1, and 0 is printed**
