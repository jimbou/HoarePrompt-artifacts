To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for i in range(n - 1):`, so we can only adjust the state of `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is at least 2.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, r is 0, n is at least 2, f is 1, num is a list of n positive integers less than or equal to n, j is n - 1, onum is a reversed copy of num, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the last element of num, stdin contains t-1 inputs: for each test case, first an integer n and then a list of n integers, i is 1. If num[i] is equal to num[i + 1], then cn is 2. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
