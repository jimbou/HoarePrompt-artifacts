The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n-1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again `j` is increased by 1 so `j` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be at least 3.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is 0, `n` is at least 3, `f` is 0 if the first two elements of `num` are different, otherwise `f` is 1, `num` is a list of `n` positive integers less than or equal to `n`, `j` is 1, stdin contains `t-1` inputs: for each test case, first an integer `n` and then a list of `n` integers.**
