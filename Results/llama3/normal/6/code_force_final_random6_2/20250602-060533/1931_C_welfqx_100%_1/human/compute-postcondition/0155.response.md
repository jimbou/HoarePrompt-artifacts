The only variable in the loop head is variable `ii` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ii` and `n`. If `ii` is less than `n-1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ii` is `n`, `n` is greater than 3. For the loop to execute again `ii` is increased by 1 so `ii` is `n+1` and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than `n+1` which is not possible. However, `n` is greater than 3, so `n-1` is greater than 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again `ii` must be less than `n-1` and `n` must be greater than `ii+1`. Therefore, `ii` is `n-1` and `n` is greater than `n-1+1` which is `n`. Since `n` is greater than 3, `n-1` is greater than 2. Therefore, `ii` is greater than 2.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `r` is either 2 or 1, `n` is greater than `ii+1`, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of `n+1` positive integers less than or equal to `n+1`, `j` is `n+1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the first element of `num`, `stdin` contains `t-4` inputs: for each test case, first an integer `n+1` and then a list of `n+1` integers, `i` is `n`, `ck` is either 1, 2 or 3, `cn` is greater than or equal to 1, and `ii` is greater than 2**
