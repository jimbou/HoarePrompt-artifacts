Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of n positive integers less than or equal to n, `j` is n - 1, `onum` is a reversed copy of num, `symb1` is the first element of num, `symb2` is the last element of num, `stdin` contains t-1 inputs: for each test case, first an integer n and then a list of n integers, `i` is n - 2, `cn` is the length of the longest prefix of num where all elements are equal, `ii` is n - 1. If `onum[ii]` is equal to `onum[ii + 1]`, then `ck` is n - 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `ck` is less than n - 1.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the value of `ck` depends on whether the elements at the last index `ii` and `ii + 1` in `onum` are equal. If they are equal, `ck` is `n - 1`, otherwise, it is less than `n - 1`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
