Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer n and then a list of n integers. The integers are positive and less or equal to n.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is assigned the value of the first input integer from stdin, which is a positive integer. The remaining inputs in stdin are still valid, containing multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers, all of which are positive and less than or equal to `n`.
