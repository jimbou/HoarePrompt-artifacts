Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `r` is either 2 or 1, `n` is greater than 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of `n` positive integers less than or equal to `n`, `j` is `n`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the first element of `num`, `stdin` contains `t-4` inputs: for each test case, first an integer `n` and then a list of `n` integers, `i` is `n-1`, `ck` is 2, `cn` is greater than or equal to 1, and `ii` is at least 1. The current value of `onum[ii]` is equal to the current value of `onum[ii + 1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `ck` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `ck` being 2. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and relationships.
