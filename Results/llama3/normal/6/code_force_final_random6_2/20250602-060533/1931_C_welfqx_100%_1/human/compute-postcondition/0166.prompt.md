You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple inputs: first an integer t, then for each test case, first an integer n and then a list of n integers. The integers are positive and less or equal to n.
    t = int(input())
    for r in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        f = 1
        
        num = [int(_) for _ in input().split()]
        
        for j in range(n - 1):
            if num[j] != num[j + 1]:
                f = 0
                break
        
        if n == 1 or f == 1:
            print(0)
            continue

        for i in range(n - 1):
            if num[i] == num[i + 1]:
                cn += 1
            else:
                break

        print(n - max(cn, ck))
        
    #State: t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 0, r is equal to t, n is greater than or equal to 1, f is 1, num is a list of n positive integers less than or equal to n, j is n - 1, onum is a reversed copy of num, stdin contains 0 inputs, i is n - 1, ck is either 1 or greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to n - 1, cn is greater than or equal to 1 plus ck, and ii is n - 1. If the current value of onum[ii] is equal to the current value of onum[ii + 1], then ck is greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to n - 1. Otherwise, ck is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the first element of num is equal to the first element of num, then cn is greater than or equal to 1 plus ck. The value of n minus the maximum of cn and ck is being printed.

Return Postconditions: t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 0, r is equal to t, n is greater than or equal to 1, f is 1, num is a list of n positive integers less than or equal to n, j is n - 1, onum is a reversed copy of num, stdin contains 0 inputs, i is n - 1, ck is either 1 or greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to n - 1, cn is greater than or equal to 1 plus ck, and ii is n - 1. If the current value of onum[ii] is equal to the current value of onum[ii + 1], then ck is greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to n - 1. Otherwise, ck is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the first element of num is equal to the first element of num, then cn is greater than or equal to 1 plus ck. The value of n minus the maximum of cn and ck is being printed.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
