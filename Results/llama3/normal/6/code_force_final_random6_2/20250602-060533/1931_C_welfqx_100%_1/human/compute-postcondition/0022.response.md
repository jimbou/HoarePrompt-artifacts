Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of `n` positive integers less than or equal to `n`, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `cn` is 2, `ck` is 1, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is 0, `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, stdin contains `t-1` inputs: for each test case, first an integer `n` and then a list of `n` integers.**

In this output state, the value of `cn` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `cn` being 2. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and relationships. The stdin still contains `t-1` inputs, and the current value of `num[i]` is still equal to the current value of `num[i + 1]`.
