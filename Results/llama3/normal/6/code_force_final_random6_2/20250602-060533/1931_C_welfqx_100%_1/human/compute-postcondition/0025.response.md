Postcondition: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, r is 0, n is at least 2, f is 1, num is a list of n positive integers less than or equal to n, j is n - 1, onum is a reversed copy of num, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the last element of num, stdin contains t-1 inputs: for each test case, first an integer n and then a list of n integers, i is 0. If num[i] is equal to num[i + 1], then cn is 2. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
