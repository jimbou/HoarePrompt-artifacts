Postcondition: **t is a positive integer greater than 2, r is either 2 or 1, n is greater than 2, f is 1, num is a list of n positive integers less than or equal to n, j is n, onum is a reversed copy of num, stdin contains t-4 inputs: for each test case, first an integer n and then a list of n integers, i is n-1, ck is either 1 or greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to n-1, cn is greater than or equal to 1 plus ck, and ii is n-1. If the current value of onum[ii] is equal to the current value of onum[ii + 1], then ck is greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to n-1. Otherwise, ck is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the first element of num is equal to the first element of num, then cn is greater than or equal to 1 plus ck.**
