Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, r is 0, n is at least 3, f is 1, num is a list of n positive integers less than or equal to n, j is n, onum is a reversed copy of num, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the last element of num, stdin contains t-1 inputs: for each test case, first an integer n and then a list of n integers, cn is 4, and we are still inside the most internal loop or if statement because num[i] is equal to num[i + 1], and i is 1.**

In this output state, the value of cn has been incremented by 1, so it is now 4. The other variables remain unchanged. The program is still inside the most internal loop or if statement because the condition num[i] == num[i + 1] is still true, and the value of i is still 1.
