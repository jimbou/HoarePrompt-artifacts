Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a list of n positive integers. It then checks if the list is already sorted or if it can be sorted by reversing a contiguous subsequence of the list. If the list is already sorted or can be sorted by reversing a subsequence, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints the minimum number of elements that need to be reversed to sort the list. The function repeats this process for each test case.**
