The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `j` is increased by 1 so `j` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r` is either 1 or 0, `n` is greater than 2, `f` is either 1 or 0, `num` is a list of `n` positive integers less than or equal to `n`, `j` is 1, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `stdin` contains `t-3` inputs: for each test case, first an integer `n` and then a list of `n` integers, `i` is `n - 2`, `cn` is the length of the longest prefix of `num` where all elements are equal plus the value of `ck`, `ii` is `n - 1`, `ck` is either `n - 1` or less than `n - 1`.**
