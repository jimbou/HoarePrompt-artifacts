The only variable in the loop head is variable `r` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `r` and `t`. If `r` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `r` is either 1 or 0, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `r` must be increased by 1 so `r` is either 2 or 1 and `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `r` is either 2 or 1, `n` is greater than 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of `n` positive integers less than or equal to `n`, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the first element of `num`, `stdin` contains `t-3` inputs: for each test case, first an integer `n` and then a list of `n` integers, `i` is `n - 1`, `ck` is either 1 or greater than 1 and less than or equal to `n`, `cn` is either `n` or less than `n` and greater than 1 and is equal to `cn + ck`, `ii` is `n - 2`. If all elements of the reversed list `onum` are equal, then `ck` is equal to `n - 1`. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, then `symb1` is equal to `symb2`. and the difference between `n` and the maximum of `cn` and `ck` is printed**
