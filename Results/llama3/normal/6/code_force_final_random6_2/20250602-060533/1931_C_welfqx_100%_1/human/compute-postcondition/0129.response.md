Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 2, r is either 2 or 1, n is greater than 2, f is 1, num is a list of n positive integers less than or equal to n, j is n, onum is a reversed copy of num, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the first element of num, stdin contains t-4 inputs: for each test case, first an integer n and then a list of n integers, i is n, ck is 1, cn is 1, ii is n - 1.**

The code snippet executes as follows: 

The first line creates a reversed copy of the list `num` and assigns it to `onum`. This does not affect any other variables. 

The second line assigns 1 to `cn`. This changes the value of `cn` from either `n` or less than `n` and greater than 1 to 1. 

The third line assigns 1 to `ck`. This changes the value of `ck` from either 1 or greater than 1 and less than or equal to `n` to 1. 

The fourth line assigns 1 to `f`. This changes the value of `f` from either 0 or 1 to 1. 

The fifth line assigns the first element of `num` to `symb1`. This does not change the value of `symb1` because it was already the first element of `num`. 

The sixth line assigns the first element of `onum` to `symb2`. This does not change the value of `symb2` because `onum` is a reversed copy of `num` and the first element of `onum` is the same as the first element of `num`. 

No other variables are affected by the code snippet.
