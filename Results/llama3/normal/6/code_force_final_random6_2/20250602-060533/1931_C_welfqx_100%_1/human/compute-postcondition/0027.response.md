Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of `n` positive integers less than or equal to `n`, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is 1, `cn` is 3, stdin contains `t-1` inputs: for each test case, first an integer `n` and then a list of `n` integers.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cn` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 3. All other variables remain unchanged. The program is still in the same state, with the same values for `t`, `r`, `n`, `f`, `num`, `j`, `onum`, `symb1`, `symb2`, and `i`. The stdin still contains `t-1` inputs, each consisting of an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers.
