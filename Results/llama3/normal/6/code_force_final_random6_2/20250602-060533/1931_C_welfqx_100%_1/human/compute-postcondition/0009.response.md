Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 0, r is 0, n is at least 3, f is 0 if the first two elements of num are different, otherwise f is 1, num is a list of n positive integers less than or equal to n, j is 1, stdin contains t-1 inputs: for each test case, first an integer n and then a list of n integers. If the first two elements of num are different, the state of the variables remains unchanged. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
