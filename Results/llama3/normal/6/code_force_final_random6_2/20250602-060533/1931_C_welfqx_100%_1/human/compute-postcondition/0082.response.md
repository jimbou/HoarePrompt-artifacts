Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r` is either 1 or 0, `n` is greater than 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of `n` positive integers less than or equal to `n`, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the first element of `num`, `stdin` contains `t-3` inputs: for each test case, first an integer `n` and then a list of `n` integers, `i` is less than `n - 1`, `cn` is either 3 or 2, `ii` is `n - 1`, `ck` is 1. If the current value of `num[i]` is equal to the current value of `num[i + 1]`, then `cn` is 3. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` is still a positive integer greater than 1, `r` is still either 1 or 0, `n` is still greater than 2, `f` is still 1, `num` is still a list of `n` positive integers less than or equal to `n`, `j` is still `n - 1`, `onum` is still a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` and `symb2` are still the first element of `num`, `stdin` still contains `t-3` inputs, `i` is still less than `n - 1`, `ii` is still `n - 1`, `ck` is still 1. The only change is that `cn` is now either 3 or 2, and if the current value of `num[i]` is equal to the current value of `num[i + 1]`, then `cn` is 3, otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
