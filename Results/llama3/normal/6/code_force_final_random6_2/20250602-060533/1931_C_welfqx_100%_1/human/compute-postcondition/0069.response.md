Postcondition: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, r is either 1 or 0, n is 1, f is either 1 or 0, num is a list of n positive integers less than or equal to n, j is n - 1, onum is a reversed copy of num, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the last element of num, stdin contains t-3 inputs: for each test case, first an integer n and then a list of n integers, i is n - 2, cn is the length of the longest prefix of num where all elements are equal plus the value of ck, ii is n - 1, ck is either n - 1 or less than n - 1. If the first element of num is not equal to the last element of num, then the current value of f is 0. Otherwise, the value of f is not changed.**
