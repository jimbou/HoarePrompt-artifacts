Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `r` is either 2 or 1, `n` is greater than 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of `n` positive integers less than or equal to `n`, `j` is `n`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the first element of `num`, `stdin` contains `t-4` inputs: for each test case, first an integer `n` and then a list of `n` integers, `i` is `n - 1`, `ck` is 1, `cn` is 2, `ii` is `n - 1`. The current value of `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cn` has been incremented by 1, making it 2. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and relationships. The input in `stdin` remains the same, with `t-4` inputs for each test case.
