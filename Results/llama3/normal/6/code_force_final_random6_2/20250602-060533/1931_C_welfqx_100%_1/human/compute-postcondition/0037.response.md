Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of n positive integers less than or equal to n, `j` is n - 1, `onum` is a reversed copy of num, `symb1` is the first element of num, `symb2` is the last element of num, `stdin` contains t-1 inputs: for each test case, first an integer n and then a list of n integers, `i` is n - 2, `cn` is the length of the longest prefix of num where all elements are equal, `ii` is 0, `ck` is 1. The current value of `onum[ii]` is equal to `onum[ii + 1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ck` has been incremented by 1, and it is now equal to 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The list `num` still contains n positive integers less than or equal to n, and `onum` is still a reversed copy of `num`. The values of `t`, `r`, `n`, `f`, `j`, `symb1`, `symb2`, `i`, `cn`, and `ii` are unchanged. The stdin still contains t-1 inputs. The current value of `onum[ii]` is still equal to `onum[ii + 1]`.
