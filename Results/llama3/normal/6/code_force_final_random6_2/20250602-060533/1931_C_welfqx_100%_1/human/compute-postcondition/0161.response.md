Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `r` is either 2 or 1, `n` is greater than 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of `n` positive integers less than or equal to `n`, `j` is `n`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, the current value of `symb1` is equal to the current value of `symb2`, `stdin` contains `t-4` inputs: for each test case, first an integer `n` and then a list of `n` integers, `i` is `n-1`, `ck` is either 1 or greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to `n-1`, `cn` is greater than or equal to 1 plus `ck`, and `ii` is `n-1`. If the current value of `onum[ii]` is equal to the current value of `onum[ii + 1]`, then `ck` is greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to `n-1`. Otherwise, `ck` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `r`, `n`, `f`, `num`, `j`, `onum`, `symb1`, `symb2`, `stdin`, `i`, and `ii` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `ck` is either 1 or greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to `n-1`. The value of `cn` is increased by `ck`, so it is now greater than or equal to 1 plus `ck`. The condition regarding `onum[ii]` and `onum[ii + 1]` still applies, and if it is not met, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
