Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than 1, r is 1, n is greater than 1, f is 1, num is a list of n positive integers less than or equal to n, j is n - 1, onum is a reversed copy of num, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the last element of num, stdin contains t-3 inputs: for each test case, first an integer n and then a list of n integers, i is n - 2, cn is the length of the longest prefix of num where all elements are equal plus the value of ck, ii is n - 1, ck is either n - 1 or less than n - 1. If the first element of num is equal to the last element of num, then the length of the longest prefix of num where all elements are equal is increased by the value of ck. Otherwise, no changes are made, and the difference between n and the maximum of cn and ck is being printed.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n - 1):
    if num[j] != num[j + 1]:
        f = 0
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r` is either 1 or 0, `n` is greater than 1, `f` is either 1 or 0, `num` is a list of `n` positive integers less than or equal to `n`, `j` is 0, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `stdin` contains `t-3` inputs: for each test case, first an integer `n` and then a list of `n` integers, `i` is `n - 2`, `cn` is the length of the longest prefix of `num` where all elements are equal plus the value of `ck`, `ii` is `n - 1`, `ck` is either `n - 1` or less than `n - 1`. If the first element of `num` is not equal to the second element of `num`, then `f` is set to 0. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r` is either 1 or 0, `n` is greater than 2, `num` is a list of `n` positive integers less than or equal to `n`, `j` is 1, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `stdin` contains `t-3` inputs: for each test case, first an integer `n` and then a list of `n` integers, `i` is `n - 2`, `cn` is the length of the longest prefix of `num` where all elements are equal plus the value of `ck`, `ii` is `n - 1`, `ck` is either `n - 1` or less than `n - 1`. If the second element of `num` is not equal to the third element of `num`, then `f` is 0. Otherwise, the value of `f` is not changed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than 1, r is either 1 or 0, n is greater than 2, num is a list of n positive integers less than or equal to n, j is 2, onum is a reversed copy of num, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the last element of num, stdin contains t-3 inputs: for each test case, first an integer n and then a list of n integers, i is n - 2, cn is the length of the longest prefix of num where all elements are equal plus the value of ck, ii is n - 1, ck is either n - 1 or less than n - 1. If the second element of num is not equal to the third element of num, then f is 0. Otherwise, the value of f is not changed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
