Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `r` is either 2 or 1, `n` is greater than `ii+1`, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of `n+1` positive integers less than or equal to `n+1`, `j` is `n+1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the first element of `num`, `stdin` contains `t-4` inputs: for each test case, first an integer `n+1` and then a list of `n+1` integers, `i` is `n`, `ck` is either 1, 2, 3 or 4, `cn` is greater than or equal to 1, and `ii` is greater than 2. If `onum[ii]` is equal to `onum[ii + 1]`, then `ck` is either 2, 3 or 4. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
