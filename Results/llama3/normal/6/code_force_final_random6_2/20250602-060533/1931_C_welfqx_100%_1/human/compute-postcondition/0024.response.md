Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of `n` positive integers less than or equal to `n`, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `cn` is 1, `ck` is 1, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is 0, `num[i]` is not equal to `num[i + 1]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their initial values, and the only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The stdin still contains `t-1` inputs: for each test case, first an integer `n` and then a list of `n` integers.
