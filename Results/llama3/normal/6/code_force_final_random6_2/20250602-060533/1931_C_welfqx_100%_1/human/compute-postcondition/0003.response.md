To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `j` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `f` is 1, and `num` is a list of `n` positive integers less than or equal to `n`. However, these states do not guarantee that the loop will execute. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be at least 2 and `j` to be 0.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of `n` positive integers less than or equal to `n`, `j` is 0, stdin contains `t-1` inputs: for each test case, first an integer `n` and then a list of `n` integers**
