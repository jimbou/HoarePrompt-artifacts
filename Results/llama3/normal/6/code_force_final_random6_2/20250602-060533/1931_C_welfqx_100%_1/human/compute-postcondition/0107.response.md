Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r` is either 1 or 0, `n` is greater than 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of `n` positive integers less than or equal to `n`, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the first element of `num`, `stdin` contains `t-3` inputs: for each test case, first an integer `n` and then a list of `n` integers, `i` is `n - 1`, `ck` is either 1 or greater than 1 and less than or equal to `n`, `cn` is either `n` or less than `n` and greater than 1 and is equal to `cn + ck`, `ii` is `n - 2`. If all elements of the reversed list `onum` are equal, then `ck` is equal to `n - 1`. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The current value of `symb1` is equal to the current value of `symb2`.**

In this output state, the value of `cn` has been updated to be the sum of its previous value and `ck`. All other variables remain unchanged. The conditions regarding the values of `ck` and the program breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement still apply.
