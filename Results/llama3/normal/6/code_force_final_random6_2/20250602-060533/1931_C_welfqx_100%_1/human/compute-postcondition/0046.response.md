Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of n positive integers less than or equal to n, `j` is n - 1, `onum` is a reversed copy of num, `symb1` is the first element of num, `symb2` is the last element of num, `stdin` contains t-1 inputs: for each test case, first an integer n and then a list of n integers, `i` is n - 2, `cn` is the length of the longest prefix of num where all elements are equal, `ii` is n - 2, `ck` is 3**

In this output state, the value of `ck` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `ck` being equal to 3. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and relationships.
