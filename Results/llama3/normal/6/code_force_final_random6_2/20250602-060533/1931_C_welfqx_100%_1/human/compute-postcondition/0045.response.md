The only variable in the loop head is variable  ii, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ii`. If `ii` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ii` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `ii` must be `n - 2` and `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of n positive integers less than or equal to n, `j` is n - 1, `onum` is a reversed copy of num, `symb1` is the first element of num, `symb2` is the last element of num, `stdin` contains t-1 inputs: for each test case, first an integer n and then a list of n integers, `i` is n - 2, `cn` is the length of the longest prefix of num where all elements are equal, `ii` is n - 2, `ck` is 2**
