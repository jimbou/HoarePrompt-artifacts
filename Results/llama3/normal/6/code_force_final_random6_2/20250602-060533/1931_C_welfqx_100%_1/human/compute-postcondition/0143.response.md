Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `r` is either 2 or 1, `n` is greater than `n+1`, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of `n+1` positive integers less than or equal to `n+1`, `j` is `n+1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the first element of `num`, `ck` is 1. If `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, then `cn` is 4 and `i` is `n`. Otherwise, `cn` is either 2 or 3, `ii` is `n`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
