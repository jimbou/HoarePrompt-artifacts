Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 2, r is either 2 or 1, n is greater than 2, f is either 0 or 1, num is a list of n positive integers less than or equal to n, j is n, onum is a reversed copy of num, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the first element of num, stdin contains t-4 inputs: for each test case, first an integer n and then a list of n integers, i is n, ck is either 1 or greater than 1 and less than or equal to n, cn is either n or less than n and greater than 1 and is equal to cn + ck, ii is n - 1. If n is 1 or f is 1, then the rest of the current iteration of the loop is skipped and the program moves to the next iteration.***
