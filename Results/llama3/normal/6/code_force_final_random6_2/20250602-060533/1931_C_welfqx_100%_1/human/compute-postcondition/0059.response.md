Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of `n` positive integers less than or equal to `n`, `j` is 0, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `stdin` contains `t-3` inputs: for each test case, first an integer `n` and then a list of `n` integers, `i` is `n - 2`, `cn` is the length of the longest prefix of `num` where all elements are equal plus the value of `ck`, `ii` is `n - 1`, `ck` is either `n - 1` or less than `n - 1`. If the first element of `num` is equal to the last element of `num`, then the length of the longest prefix of `num` where all elements are equal is increased by the value of `ck`. Otherwise, no changes are made, and the difference between `n` and the maximum of `cn` and `ck` is being printed. The current value of `num[j]` is not equal to the current value of `num[j + 1]`.**
