The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is `n`, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be increased by 1 so `n` is at least 3.
State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, r is 0, n is at least 3, f is 1, num is a list of n positive integers less than or equal to n, j is n, onum is a reversed copy of num, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the last element of num, stdin contains t-1 inputs: for each test case, first an integer n and then a list of n integers. If num[i] is equal to num[i + 1], then cn is 3 and i is 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
