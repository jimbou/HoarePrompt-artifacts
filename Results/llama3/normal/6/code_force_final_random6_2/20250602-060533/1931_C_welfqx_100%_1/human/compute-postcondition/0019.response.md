Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, r is 0, n is a positive integer, f is 1, num is a list of n positive integers less than or equal to n, j is n - 1, onum is a reversed copy of num, cn is 1, ck is 1, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the last element of num, stdin contains t-1 inputs: for each test case, first an integer n and then a list of n integers.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of t remains unchanged as a positive integer greater than 0. The value of r is still 0. The value of n remains a positive integer. The value of f is now 1, regardless of its previous value. The list num remains unchanged, containing n positive integers less than or equal to n. The value of j is still n - 1. A new list onum is created, which is a reversed copy of num. Two new variables cn and ck are introduced, both with a value of 1. Two new variables symb1 and symb2 are introduced, where symb1 is the first element of num and symb2 is the last element of num. The stdin remains unchanged, containing t-1 inputs for each test case.
