Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, r is either 1 or 0, n is greater than 1, f is 1, num is a list of n positive integers less than or equal to n, j is n - 1, onum is a reversed copy of num, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the first element of num, stdin contains t-3 inputs: for each test case, first an integer n and then a list of n integers, i is n - 2, cn is 1, ii is n - 1, ck is 1.**

The code block modifies the state of several variables. The first line creates a reversed copy of the list `num` and assigns it to `onum`. The second line sets `cn` to 1. The third line sets `ck` to 1. The fourth line sets `f` to 1. The fifth line assigns the first element of `num` to `symb1`. The sixth line assigns the first element of `onum` (which is the last element of `num`) to `symb2`. The values of `t`, `r`, `n`, `j`, `i`, and `ii` remain unchanged. The state of `stdin` also remains unchanged.
