Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `r` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of n positive integers less than or equal to n, `j` is n - 1, `onum` is a reversed copy of num, `symb1` is the first element of num, `symb2` is the last element of num, `stdin` contains t-1 inputs: for each test case, first an integer n and then a list of n integers, `i` is n - 2, `cn` is the length of the longest prefix of num where all elements are equal, `ii` is n - 2, `ck` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged.
