Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, r is 0, n is at least 2, f is 1, num is a list of n positive integers less than or equal to n, j is n - 1, onum is a reversed copy of num, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the last element of num, stdin contains t-1 inputs: for each test case, first an integer n and then a list of n integers, i is n - 2, cn is the length of the longest prefix of num where all elements are equal, and if num[i] is not equal to num[i + 1], then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `n - 2`, and the value of `cn` will be the length of the longest prefix of `num` where all elements are equal. If the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, it means that `num[i]` is not equal to `num[i + 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
