Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r` is either 1 or 0, `n` is greater than 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of `n` positive integers less than or equal to `n`, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the first element of `num`, `stdin` contains `t-3` inputs: for each test case, first an integer `n` and then a list of `n` integers, `i` is less than `n - 1`, `ck` is 1. If the current value of `num[i]` is equal to the current value of `num[i + 1]`, then `cn` is 4. Otherwise, `cn` is either 2 or 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
