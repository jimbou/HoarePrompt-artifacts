Postcondition: **t is a positive integer greater than 2, r is either 2 or 1, n is greater than 2, f is 1, num is a list of n positive integers less than or equal to n, j is n, onum is a reversed copy of num, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the first element of num, stdin contains t-4 inputs: for each test case, first an integer n and then a list of n integers, i is n-1, ck is either 1 or 2, cn is greater than or equal to 1, and ii is at least 1. If the current value of onum[ii] is equal to the current value of onum[ii + 1], then ck is 2. Otherwise, ck is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
