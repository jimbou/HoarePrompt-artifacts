Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `r` is either 2 or 1, `n` is greater than `n+1`, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of `n+1` positive integers less than or equal to `n+1`, `j` is `n+1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the first element of `num`, `ck` is 1, `cn` is either 2 or 3, `ii` is `n`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. The stdin still contains `t-4` inputs: for each test case, first an integer `n+1` and then a list of `n+1` integers.
