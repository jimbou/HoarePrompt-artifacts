Based on the precondition, let's break down the variables and their relationships:

* `n` is greater than 2.
* `ck` is either 1 or greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to `n-1`.
* `cn` is greater than or equal to 1 plus `ck`.
* `ii` is `n-1`.

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print(n - max(cn, ck))`

The `max` function returns the maximum value between `cn` and `ck`. Since `cn` is greater than or equal to 1 plus `ck`, `cn` will always be greater than or equal to `ck`. Therefore, `max(cn, ck)` will always return `cn`.

So, the print statement can be simplified to:

`print(n - cn)`

Since `cn` is greater than or equal to 1 plus `ck`, and `ck` is either 1 or greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to `n-1`, we can conclude that `cn` is at least 2 and at most `n`.

Therefore, the value of `n - cn` will be a non-negative integer less than or equal to `n-2`.

Output: **a non-negative integer less than or equal to n-2**
