Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r` is either 1 or 0, `n` is greater than 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of `n` positive integers less than or equal to `n`, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the first element of `num`, `stdin` contains `t-3` inputs: for each test case, first an integer `n` and then a list of `n` integers, `i` is `n - 1`, `ck` is 1. If the current value of `num[i]` is equal to the current value of `num[i + 1]` for all `i` in the range `[0, n-1)`, then `cn` is `n`. Otherwise, `cn` is less than `n` and greater than 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the value of `i` has reached `n - 1`. The value of `cn` depends on whether the elements of `num` are all equal. If they are, `cn` is equal to `n`. Otherwise, `cn` is less than `n` and greater than 1, indicating that the loop broke out of the most internal loop or if statement at some point. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
