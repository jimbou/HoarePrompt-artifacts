The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line performs a bitwise right shift operation on the list `n`, effectively dividing the first integer in the list by 2. The second line increments the value of `position` by 1.

Output State: **n is a list of two integers, where the first integer is a quarter of the original number of non-negative integers to be printed and the second integer is the original sum of these integers, and n is not equal to 0, position is 3**
