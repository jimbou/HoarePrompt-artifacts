Output State: **`n` is a list of two integers, where the first integer is the number of non-negative integers to be printed (n) and the second integer is the sum of these integers (k), such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9. The first element of n is not equal to 0, `position` is 0.**

In this output state, the list `n` remains unchanged with its two integers, and a new variable `position` is introduced with a value of 0. The constraints on `n` and its elements are still valid.
