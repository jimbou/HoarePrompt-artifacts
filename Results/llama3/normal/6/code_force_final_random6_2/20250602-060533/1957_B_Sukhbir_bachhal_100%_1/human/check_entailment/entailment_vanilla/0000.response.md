Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of constructing a sequence of n non-negative integers that sum up to k, such that the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence is maximized.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases t.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of n and k.
3. If n is greater than 1, the program calculates the maximum number of 1s that can be achieved in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence. This is done by finding the position of the most significant bit in the binary representation of k, which is calculated using the func_1 function.
4. The program then constructs the sequence by appending the following elements:
   - The first element is 2 to the power of the counter (calculated in step 3) minus 1. This ensures that the most significant bit in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence is 1.
   - The second element is k minus the first element. This ensures that the sum of the sequence is k.
   - The remaining n-2 elements are 0.
5. If n is 1, the program simply prints k.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the desired output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
