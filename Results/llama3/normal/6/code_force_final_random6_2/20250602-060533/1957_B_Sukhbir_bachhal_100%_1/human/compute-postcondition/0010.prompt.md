Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a list of two integers, where the first integer is the number of non-negative integers to be printed (n) and the second integer is the sum of these integers (k), such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9. The first element of n is not equal to 0, `position` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while n != 0:
    n >>= 1
    position += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is a list of two integers, where the first integer is the number of non-negative integers to be printed (n) and the second integer is the sum of these integers (k), such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9, n is now half of its original value, position is 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: n is a list of two integers, where the first integer is half of the original number of non-negative integers to be printed and the second integer is the original sum of these integers, position is 2
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: n is a list of two integers, where the first integer is a quarter of the original number of non-negative integers to be printed and the second integer is the original sum of these integers, and n is not equal to 0, position is 3


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
