Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

# Annotated Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    arr = []
    if n > 1:
        counter = func_1(k)
        arr.append(2 ** counter - 1)
        arr.append(k - arr[-1])
        for _ in range(n - 2):
            arr.append(0)
        print(*arr)
    else:
        print(k)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a list of two integers, where the first integer is the number of non-negative integers to be printed (n) and the second integer is the sum of these integers (k), such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9.
    if (n == 0) :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1.
    #State: *n is a list of two integers, where the first integer is the number of non-negative integers to be printed (n) and the second integer is the sum of these integers (k), such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9. The first element of n is not equal to 0
    position = 0
    while n != 0:
        n >>= 1
        
        position += 1
        
    #State: n is a list of two integers, where the first integer is 0 and the second integer is the original sum of these integers, position is the number of times the loop executed.
    return position - 1
    #The program returns the number of times the loop executed minus 1, where the loop executed at least once since the list 'n' has two integers.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the number of times the first element of the input list 'n' can be right-shifted until it becomes 0, minus 1, and returns this value. If the first element of 'n' is 0, the function returns -1. The function does not modify the input list 'n' and only uses its first element for the calculation.

Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
