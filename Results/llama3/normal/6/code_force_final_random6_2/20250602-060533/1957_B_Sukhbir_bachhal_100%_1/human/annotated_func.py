#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a list of two integers, where the first integer is the number of non-negative integers to be printed (n) and the second integer is the sum of these integers (k), such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9.
    if (n == 0) :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1.
    #State: *n is a list of two integers, where the first integer is the number of non-negative integers to be printed (n) and the second integer is the sum of these integers (k), such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9. The first element of n is not equal to 0
    position = 0
    while n != 0:
        n >>= 1
        
        position += 1
        
    #State: n is a list of two integers, where the first integer is 0 and the second integer is the original sum of these integers, position is the number of times the loop executed.
    return position - 1
    #The program returns the number of times the loop executed minus 1, where the loop executed at least once since the list 'n' has two integers.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the number of times the first element of the input list 'n' can be right-shifted until it becomes 0, minus 1, and returns this value. If the first element of 'n' is 0, the function returns -1. The function does not modify the input list 'n' and only uses its first element for the calculation.
