The variable in the loop head is variable n, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable n.  If n is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is half of its original value, So for the loop to be executed one more time n cannot be 0.
State: **n is a list of two integers, where the first integer is the number of non-negative integers to be printed (n) and the second integer is the sum of these integers (k), such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9, n is now half of its original value and n is not equal to 0, position is 1**
