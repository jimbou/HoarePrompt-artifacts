Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem where we need to construct a sequence of n non-negative integers that sum up to k, such that the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of these integers is maximized.

The program uses a function `func_1(k)` to calculate the number of times the binary representation of k can be right-shifted until it becomes 0, minus 1. This value is used to construct the sequence of integers.

The program handles two cases: when n is greater than 1 and when n is 1.

When n is greater than 1, the program calculates the value of `counter` using `func_1(k)`, appends `2 ** counter - 1` to the array, appends `k - arr[-1]` to the array, and then appends 0 to the array `n - 2` times. This ensures that the sum of the integers in the array is equal to k.

When n is 1, the program simply prints k.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases. The function `func_1(k)` correctly calculates the number of times the binary representation of k can be right-shifted until it becomes 0, minus 1, which is used to construct the sequence of integers.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
