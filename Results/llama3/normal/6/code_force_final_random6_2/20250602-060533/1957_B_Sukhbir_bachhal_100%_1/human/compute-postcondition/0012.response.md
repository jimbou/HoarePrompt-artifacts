Functionality: **This function calculates the number of times the first element of the input list 'n' can be right-shifted until it becomes 0, minus 1, and returns this value. If the first element of 'n' is 0, the function returns -1. The function does not modify the input list 'n' and only uses its first element for the calculation.**
