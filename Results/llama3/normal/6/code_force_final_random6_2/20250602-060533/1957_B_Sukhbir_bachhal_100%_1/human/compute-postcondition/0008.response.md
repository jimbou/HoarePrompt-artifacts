The variable in the loop head is variable n, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable n.  If n is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is a list of two integers, where the first integer is half of the original number of non-negative integers to be printed and the second integer is the original sum of these integers. So for the loop to be executed one more time n cannot be equal to 0.
State: **n is a list of two integers, where the first integer is half of the original number of non-negative integers to be printed and the second integer is the original sum of these integers, and n is not equal to 0, position is 2**
