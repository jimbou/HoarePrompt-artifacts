Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to construct a sequence of n non-negative integers that sum up to k and maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of these integers.

The function `func_1(k)` calculates the position of the most significant bit in the binary representation of k. This is done by shifting the bits of k to the right until k becomes 0, and counting the number of shifts.

The main program then constructs the sequence of integers as follows:

* If n is greater than 1, it appends `2 ** counter - 1` to the sequence, where counter is the position of the most significant bit in the binary representation of k. This ensures that the bitwise OR of the sequence will have a 1 in the most significant bit position.
* It then appends `k - arr[-1]` to the sequence, which ensures that the sum of the sequence is equal to k.
* It then appends `n - 2` zeros to the sequence, which ensures that the length of the sequence is equal to n.

If n is equal to 1, it simply prints k.

The program correctly handles the edge case where n is equal to 0, by returning -1.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
