Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 1, n is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, m is greater than or equal to count + 1 and is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, count is less than or equal to m and is one more than its original value, countmins is equal to count - 1, g is a floating point number equal to n/count, ans is equal to n plus g / count + 1 where g is the original g minus countmins.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, and `count` remain unchanged from the initial state. The value of `countmins` is now equal to `count - 1`, which is one less than its original value. The value of `g` is now equal to `n / count`, which is the original value of `g` minus `countmins`. The value of `ans` is now equal to `n` plus `g / count + 1`, where `g` is the original value of `g` minus `countmins`.
