Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, i is 0, n is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, m is a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to 4, count is 3, ans is equal to n + (n/2 - 1)/2 + 1, countmins is 2, g is a floating point number equal to n/3, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If g is less than countmins, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
