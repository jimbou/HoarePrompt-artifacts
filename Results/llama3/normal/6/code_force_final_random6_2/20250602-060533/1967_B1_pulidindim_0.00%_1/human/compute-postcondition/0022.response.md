The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `t` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, `count` is equal to `m` + 1, `ans` is equal to `n` + (`n`/2 - 1)/2 + 1 + (`n`/3 - 2) / 4 + 1 + ... + (`n`/`m` - (`m` - 1)) / `m` + 1, `countmins` is equal to `m`, `g` is a floating point number equal to `n`/`m` - (`m` - 1), and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and the integer part of `ans` which is equal to `n` + (`n`/2 - 1)/2 + 1 + (`n`/3 - 2) / 4 + 1 + ... + (`n`/`m` - (`m` - 1)) / `m` + 1 is being printed**
