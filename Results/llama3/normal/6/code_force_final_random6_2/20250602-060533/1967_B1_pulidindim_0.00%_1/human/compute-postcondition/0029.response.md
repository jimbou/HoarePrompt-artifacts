Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 1, n is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, m is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, count is less than or equal to m and is one more than its original value, ans is equal to n plus g / count + 1 where g is the original g minus countmins, countmins is equal to count - 1, and g is a floating point number equal to n/count.**

In this output state, the values of t, i, n, and m remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of count is incremented by 1, and the value of ans is updated by adding g / count + 1 to its original value. The value of countmins is updated to be equal to the new value of count minus 1. The value of g is updated by subtracting countmins from its original value.
