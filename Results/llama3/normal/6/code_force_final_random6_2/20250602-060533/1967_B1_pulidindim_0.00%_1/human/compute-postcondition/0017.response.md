Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, i is 0, n is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, m is a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to 5, count is 4, ans is equal to n + (n/2 - 1)/2 + 1 + (n/3 - 2) / 4 + 1, countmins is 3, g is a floating point number equal to n/4. If g is less than countmins, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
