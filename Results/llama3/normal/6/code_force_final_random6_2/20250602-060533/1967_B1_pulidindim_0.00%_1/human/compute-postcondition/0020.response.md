The code prints the integer value of `ans`, which is a sum of several terms calculated based on the values of `n` and `m`. Specifically, `ans` is equal to `n` plus the sum of several fractions, each of which is calculated as `(n/k - (k - 1)) / k + 1`, where `k` ranges from 2 to `m`.

Since `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, and `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, the value of `ans` will be a positive integer.

However, without knowing the exact values of `n` and `m`, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. Therefore, the output will be the integer value of `ans`, which is a function of `n` and `m`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of n and several fractions calculated based on n and m)**
