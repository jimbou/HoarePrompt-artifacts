The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. Since stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing two positive integers `n` and `m`, the first integer is assigned to `t`. The remaining test cases are still in stdin. 

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two positive integers `n` and `m`, where 1 <= `n`, `m` <= 2 * 10^6. The sum of `n` and the sum of `m` over all test cases do not exceed 2 * 10^6.**
