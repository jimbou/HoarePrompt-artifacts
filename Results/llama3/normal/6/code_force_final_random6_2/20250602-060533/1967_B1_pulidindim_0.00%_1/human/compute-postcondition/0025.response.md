Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 1, n is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, m is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, count is less than or equal to m, ans is equal to n, countmins is equal to count - 1, and g is a floating point number equal to n/count.**

In this output state, the value of `countmins` has been decremented by 1, and the value of `g` has been updated to be the result of the division of `n` by `count`. All other variables remain unchanged.
