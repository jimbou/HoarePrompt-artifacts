Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 1, n is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, m is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, count is 2, ans is equal to n, countmins is equal to m, g is a floating point number equal to n/m - (m - 1), and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.
Code of the loop:
while count <= m:
    countmins = count - 1
    g = n / count
    if g < countmins:
        break
    g -= countmins
    ans += g / count + 1
    count += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 1, n is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, m is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, count is less than or equal to m and is one more than its original value, ans is equal to n plus g / count + 1 where g is the original g minus countmins, countmins is equal to count - 1, and g is a floating point number equal to n/count.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 1, n is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, m is greater than or equal to count + 1 and is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, count is less than or equal to m and is two more than its original value, countmins is equal to count - 1, g is a floating point number equal to n/count minus countmins, ans is equal to n plus g / count + 1 where g is the original g minus countmins. If g is less than countmins, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 1, n is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, m is greater than count and is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, count is less than or equal to m and is three more than its original value, countmins is equal to count minus 1, g is a floating point number equal to n/count minus countmins, ans is equal to n plus g / count + 1 plus g / count + 1 where g is the original g. If g is less than countmins, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
