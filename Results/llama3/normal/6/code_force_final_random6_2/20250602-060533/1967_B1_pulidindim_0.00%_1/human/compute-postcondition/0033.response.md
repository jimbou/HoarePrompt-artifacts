Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 1, n is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, m is greater than or equal to count + 1 and is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, count is less than or equal to m and is one more than its original value, countmins is equal to count - 1, g is a floating point number equal to n/count, ans is equal to n plus g / count + 1 where g is the original g minus countmins. If g is less than countmins, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
