Postcondition: **t is a positive integer, i is 0, n is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, m is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, count is 2, ans is equal to n, countmins is 1, g is a floating point number equal to n/2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If g is less than countmins, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution.**
