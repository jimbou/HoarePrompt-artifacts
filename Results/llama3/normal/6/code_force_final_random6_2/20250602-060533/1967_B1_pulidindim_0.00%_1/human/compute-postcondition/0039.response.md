Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 1, n is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, m is greater than count and is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, count is less than or equal to m and is three more than its original value, countmins is equal to count minus 1, g is a floating point number equal to n/count minus countmins, ans is equal to n plus g / count + 1 plus g / count + 1 where g is the original g. If g is less than countmins, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the value of `t` and `i` remains unchanged. The value of `n` and `m` also remains unchanged. The value of `count` is incremented by 1, making it three more than its original value. The value of `countmins` is equal to `count` minus 1. The value of `g` is decremented by `countmins`, making it equal to `n/count` minus `countmins`. The value of `ans` is incremented by `g / count + 1`, making it equal to `n` plus `g / count + 1` plus `g / count + 1` where `g` is the original `g`. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `g` is less than `countmins`.
