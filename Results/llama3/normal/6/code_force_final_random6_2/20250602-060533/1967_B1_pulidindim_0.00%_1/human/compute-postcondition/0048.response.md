Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, `m` is a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to 2, `count` is 2, `ans` is equal to `n`, `countmins` is 1, the integer value of `ans` is being printed, and the current value of `g` is less than `countmins`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: All the variables maintain their initial values and properties, and we exit the innermost loop or conditional statement. The value of `ans`, which is equal to `n`, is still being printed.
