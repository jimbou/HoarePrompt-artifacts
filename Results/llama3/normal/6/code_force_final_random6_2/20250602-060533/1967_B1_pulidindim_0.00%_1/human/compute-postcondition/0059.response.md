Postcondition: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 2, n is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, m is a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to 5, count is 4, countmins is 3, g is n / 4, ans is equal to n + (n / 4 - 3) / 4 + 1 + n / 4 / 4 + 1. If g is less than countmins, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the current values of t, i, n, m, count, countmins, g, and ans.**
