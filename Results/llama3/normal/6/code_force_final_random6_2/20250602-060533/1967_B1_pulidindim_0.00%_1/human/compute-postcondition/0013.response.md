Output State: **t is a positive integer, i is 0, n is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, m is a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to 4, count is 4, ans is equal to n + (n/2 - 1)/2 + 1 + (n/3 - 2) / 4 + 1, countmins is 2, g is a floating point number equal to n/3 - 2, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, and `countmins` remains unchanged. The value of `count` is incremented by 1, becoming 4. The value of `ans` is updated by adding `(n/3 - 2) / 4 + 1` to its original value. The value of `g` is decremented by `countmins`, which is 2, resulting in `n/3 - 2`.
