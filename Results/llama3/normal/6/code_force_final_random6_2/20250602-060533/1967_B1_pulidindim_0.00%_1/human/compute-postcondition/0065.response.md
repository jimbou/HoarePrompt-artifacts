Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two positive integers n and m. It calculates a value 'ans' for each test case, which is initially set to n and then incremented by the sum of g / count + 1 for count from 2 to m, where g is n / count - (count - 1). The function prints the integer value of 'ans' for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the standard input empty.**
