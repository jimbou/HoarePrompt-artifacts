Output State: **t is a positive integer, i is equal to t - 1, n is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, m is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, count is equal to m + 1, ans is equal to n + sum(g / count + 1) from count = 2 to m, g is n / m - (m - 1), and the integer value of ans which is equal to n + sum(g / count + 1) from count = 2 to m is being printed, and stdin contains no test cases.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the loop counter `i` will be one less than the total number of test cases `t`. The values of `n` and `m` will be the last test case read from the input. The `count` variable will be one more than the value of `m` in the last test case. The `ans` variable will hold the final result of the calculation for the last test case, which is the sum of `n` and the sum of `g / count + 1` for all values of `count` from 2 to `m`. The `g` variable will hold the value of `n / m - (m - 1)` for the last test case. Finally, the integer part of `ans` will be printed, and there will be no more test cases left in the input.
