Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, `count` is 2, `ans` is equal to `n`, `countmins` is 1, `g` is a floating point number equal to `n/2`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, but we exit the innermost loop or if statement. The variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `count`, `ans`, `countmins`, and `g` retain their original values, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
