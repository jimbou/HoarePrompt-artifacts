Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions. The issue lies in the way it calculates the value of `ans`. The program assumes that the number of valid pairs for each `count` is `g / count + 1`, where `g` is the quotient of `n` divided by `count`. However, this is not accurate.

A correct approach would involve iterating over all possible values of `a` and `b` and checking if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. The program does not do this and instead uses a flawed mathematical formula to calculate the number of valid pairs.

For example, when `n = 10` and `m = 8`, the program outputs `14`, but the correct answer is `15`. The pair `(10, 2)` is not counted by the program, but it satisfies the conditions.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and its output may not match the expected output for all test cases.
