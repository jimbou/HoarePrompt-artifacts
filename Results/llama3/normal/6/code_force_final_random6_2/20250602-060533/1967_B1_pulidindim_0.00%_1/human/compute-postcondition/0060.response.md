Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 2, n is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, m is a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to 5, count is 5, countmins is 3, g is n / 4 - 3, ans is equal to n + (n / 4 - 3) / 4 + 1 + n / 4 / 4 + 1 + (n / 4 - 3) / 5 + 1.**

In this output state, the value of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m` remains unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `count` is incremented by 1, making it 5. The value of `countmins` remains the same as it is not modified by the code. The value of `g` is decremented by `countmins`, which is 3, making it `n / 4 - 3`. The value of `ans` is incremented by `g / count + 1`, which is `(n / 4 - 3) / 5 + 1`.
