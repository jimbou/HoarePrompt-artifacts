Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, `m` is a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to 5, `count` is 4, `ans` is equal to `n + (n/2 - 1)/2 + 1 + (n/3 - 2) / 4 + 1`, `countmins` is 3, `g` is a floating point number equal to `n/4`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code only contains a break statement, which means it will exit the innermost loop or if statement it is currently in. The values of all variables remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the innermost loop or if statement.
