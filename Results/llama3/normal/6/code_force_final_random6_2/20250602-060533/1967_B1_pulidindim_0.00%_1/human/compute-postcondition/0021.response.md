Output: **t is a positive integer, i is 0, n is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, m is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, count is equal to m + 1, ans is equal to n + (n/2 - 1)/2 + 1 + (n/3 - 2) / 4 + 1 + ... + (n/m - (m - 1)) / m + 1, countmins is equal to m, g is a floating point number equal to n/m - (m - 1), and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and the integer part of ans which is equal to n + (n/2 - 1)/2 + 1 + (n/3 - 2) / 4 + 1 + ... + (n/m - (m - 1)) / m + 1 is being printed**
