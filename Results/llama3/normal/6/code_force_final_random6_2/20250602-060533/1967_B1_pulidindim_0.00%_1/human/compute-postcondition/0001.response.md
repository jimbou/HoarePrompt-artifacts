To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer, which already implies that `t` is at least 1, so we don't need to adjust `t`. However, we do need to adjust `i` to be 0, since the loop will start from the first iteration.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two positive integers `n` and `m`, where 1 <= `n`, `m` <= 2 * 10^6. The sum of `n` and the sum of `m` over all test cases do not exceed 2 * 10^6.**
