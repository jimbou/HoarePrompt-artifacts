Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, `m` is greater than `count` and is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, `count` is less than or equal to `m` and is two more than its original value, `countmins` is equal to `count`, `g` is a floating point number equal to `n/count`, `ans` is equal to `n` plus `g` / `count` + 1 where `g` is the original `g`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `count`, `countmins`, `g`, and `ans` remain the same as in the initial state, but we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
