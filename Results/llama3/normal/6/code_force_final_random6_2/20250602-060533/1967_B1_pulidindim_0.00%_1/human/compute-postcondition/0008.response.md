Output State: **t is a positive integer, i is 0, n is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, m is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, count is 3, ans is equal to n + (n/2 - 1)/2 + 1, countmins is 1, g is a floating point number equal to n/2 - 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of `t` and `i` remains unchanged. The value of `n` and `m` also remains unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The value of `count` is incremented by 1, making it 3. The value of `ans` is updated by adding `(n/2 - 1)/2 + 1` to `n`. The value of `countmins` remains unchanged. The value of `g` is decremented by 1, making it `n/2 - 1`. The state of `stdin` remains the same as it is not affected by the code.
