Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, `count` is less than or equal to `m`, `ans` is equal to `n`, `countmins` is equal to `count - 1`, `g` is a floating point number equal to `n/count`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their initial values and properties, as the `break` statement only terminates the execution of the innermost loop or if statement, without modifying any variable values.
