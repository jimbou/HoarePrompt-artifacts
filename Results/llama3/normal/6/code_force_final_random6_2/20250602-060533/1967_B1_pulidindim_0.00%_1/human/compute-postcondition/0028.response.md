Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 1, n is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, m is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, count is less than or equal to m, ans is equal to n, countmins is equal to count - 1, and g is a floating point number equal to n/count. If g is less than countmins, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
