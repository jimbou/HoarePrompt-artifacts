Output State: **T is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, stdin contains T-3 or T-4 test cases, n is at least 2, k is greater than 0 after the decrease, l is at least 0, r is at least 1, a is a list of n non-negative integers, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r], t is either 0 or 1 if mi * 2 > k. If mi * 2 <= k, then k has been decreased by 2 * mi, a[l] has been decreased by 2 * mi, and a[r] has been decreased by 2 * mi. If a[l] is 0, then ans is 2 if a[r] is not 0 and a[l] - t does not equal k/2, otherwise ans is 3. If a[l] is not 0, then ans is 1 if a[r] is not 0 and a[l] - t does not equal k/2, otherwise ans is 2. If mi * 2 > k, then k has not been decreased to 0, a[l] has been decreased by mi, and a[r] has been decreased by mi. If a[r] is 0 or a[l] is 0 or a[l] - t equals k/2 and a[l] - t - k // 2 equals 0, then ans is 2, otherwise ans is 1. t is either 0 or 1 depending on whether k is even or odd, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r], and ans has been increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: T is still greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, there are still T-3 or T-4 test cases left in stdin, n is still at least 2, k is still greater than 0 after the decrease, l is still at least 0, r is still at least 1, a is still a list of n non-negative integers, mi is still the minimum of a[l] and a[r], t is still either 0 or 1 depending on whether k is even or odd, and we are still breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. The only change is that ans has been increased by 1.
