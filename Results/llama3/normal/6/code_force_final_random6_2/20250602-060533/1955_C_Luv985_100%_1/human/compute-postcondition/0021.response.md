Output State: **T is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, stdin contains T-2 or T-3 test cases, n is at least 2, k is at least 2 times mi plus 1 if mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, a is a list of n positive integers where a[0] is its original value minus mi and a[n-1] is its original value minus mi if mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, l is at most n-2, r is n-1, ans is 0, 1, or 2, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r], and t is either 0 or 1 depending on whether k is even or odd if mi * 2 is larger than k.**

In this output state, the value of mi has been updated to be the minimum of a[l] and a[r]. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that the value of mi is now more specific, as it is now the minimum of a[l] and a[r], rather than just the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1] after subtraction of mi.
