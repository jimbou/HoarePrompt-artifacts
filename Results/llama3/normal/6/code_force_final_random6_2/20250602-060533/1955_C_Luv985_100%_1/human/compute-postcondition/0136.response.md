Postcondition: **T is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, stdin contains T-4 or T-5 test cases, n is at least 2, k is greater than 0 and has been decreased by mi * 2, r is at least 1, l is less than r, a is a list of n non-negative integers where a[l] and a[r] have been decreased by mi, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r] after the decrease, and t is equal to k % 2. If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, then ans is 2, 3, or 4 if a[l] and a[r] are 0, or 1, 2, or 3 if a[r] is 0 and a[l] is not 0, or 0, 1, or 2 if a[r] is not 0 and a[l] is not 0. If mi * 2 is greater than k, then ans is 1, 2, or 3 if a[l] - t - k // 2 equals 0, or remains 0, 1, or 2 otherwise. If a[l] is 0, then l has been incremented by 1 and ans has been incremented by 1. If a[r] is 0, then ans has been incremented by 1.**
