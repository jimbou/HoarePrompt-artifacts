Postcondition: **T is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, stdin contains T-2 or T-3 test cases, n is at least 2, k is 0, l is equal to r and is at most n-1, r is equal to l and is at most n-1, a is a list of n non-negative integers, ans is at least 0 and at most n, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r] which are equal since l is equal to r, and t is either 0 or 1 depending on whether k is even or odd.**
