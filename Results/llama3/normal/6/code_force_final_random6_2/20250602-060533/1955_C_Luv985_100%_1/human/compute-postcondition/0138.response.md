Output State: **T is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, stdin contains T-4 or T-5 test cases, n is at least 2, k is greater than 0, r is at least 1 and l is less than r, a is a list of n non-negative integers, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r], and t is equal to k % 2. If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, then a[l] and a[r] are decreased by mi. If a[r] is 0, then if a[l] is 0, l is 1 and ans is 3, 4, or 5. Otherwise, l is 0 or 1 and ans is 2, 3, or 4. If a[r] is not 0, then if a[l] is 0, l is 1 and ans is 2, 3, or 4. Otherwise, l is 0 or 1 and ans is 1, 2, or 3. If mi * 2 is greater than k, then if a[l] - t - k // 2 equals 0, then ans is 2, 3, or 4. Otherwise, ans is 1, 2, or 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: T is still greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, and there are T-4 or T-5 test cases left in the input. The values of n, k, r, and l remain the same. The list a still contains n non-negative integers, and mi is still the minimum of a[l] and a[r]. The value of t is still equal to k % 2. The value of ans has been incremented by 1. The conditions for a[r] being 0 or not, and mi * 2 being less than or equal to k or not, still apply, but the possible values of ans have been updated accordingly.
