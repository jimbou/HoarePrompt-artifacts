Postcondition: **T is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, stdin contains T-2 or T-3 test cases, n is at least 2, k is at least 1, l is at most n-3 (or n-2 if mi * 2 is less than or equal to k and a[l] is 0), r is either n-2 (if a[r] is 0) or n-1 (otherwise), a is a list of n positive integers where a[0] is its original value minus mi and a[n-1] is its original value minus mi if mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, ans is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r], and t is either 0 or 1 depending on whether k is even or odd. If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, then k is reduced by 2 times the minimum of a[l] and a[r], a[l] is reduced by mi, a[r] is reduced by mi. If a[l] is 0, then l is at most n-2 (or n-1 if mi * 2 is less than or equal to k and a[l] is 0), and ans is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. If mi * 2 is greater than k, then if a[l] - t - k // 2 equals 0, then ans is 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Otherwise, ans is 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
