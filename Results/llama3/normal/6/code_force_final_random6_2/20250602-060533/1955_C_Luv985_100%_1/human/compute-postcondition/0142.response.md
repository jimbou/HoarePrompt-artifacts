Output State: **T is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, stdin contains T-4 or T-5 test cases, n is at least 2, k is 0, l is at least 0 and less than or equal to r, r is at least 1, a is a list of n non-negative integers, ans is at least 0 and at most n, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r], and t is equal to k % 2.**

This output state means that after the loop has finished executing, the value of T has been decreased by 1, and there are T-4 or T-5 test cases left in stdin. The value of n remains at least 2, and the value of k has been reduced to 0. The value of l is at least 0 and less than or equal to r, and the value of r is at least 1. The list a contains n non-negative integers, and the value of ans is at least 0 and at most n. The value of mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r], and the value of t is equal to k % 2.
