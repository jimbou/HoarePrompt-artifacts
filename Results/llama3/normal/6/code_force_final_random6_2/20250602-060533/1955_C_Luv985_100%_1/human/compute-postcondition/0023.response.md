Output State: **T is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, stdin contains T-2 or T-3 test cases, n is at least 2, k is at least 2 times mi plus 1 if mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, a is a list of n positive integers where a[0] is its original value minus mi and a[n-1] is its original value minus mi if mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, l is at most n-1, r is n-1, ans is 1, 2, or 3, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r], and t is either 0 or 1 depending on whether k is even or odd if mi * 2 is larger than k.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `l` has been incremented by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The value of `mi` is still the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, but since `l` has changed, the value of `mi` may also have changed. The value of `t` is still either 0 or 1, depending on whether `k` is even or odd if `mi * 2` is larger than `k`.
