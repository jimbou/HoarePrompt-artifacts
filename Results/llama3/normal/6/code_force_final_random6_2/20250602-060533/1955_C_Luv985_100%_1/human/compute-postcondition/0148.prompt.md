Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is an integer, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, where n is a positive integer and k is a non-negative integer. The second line contains n positive integers.
Code of the loop:
while T:
    T -= 1
    n, k = input().split()
    n = int(n)
    k = int(k)
    a = input().split()
    a = list(map(lambda x: int(x), a))
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    ans = 0
    while l < r and k > 0:
        mi = min(a[l], a[r])
        if mi * 2 <= k:
            a[l] -= mi
            a[r] -= mi
            k -= mi * 2
            if a[l] == 0:
                ans += 1
                l += 1
            if a[r] == 0:
                ans += 1
                r -= 1
        else:
            t = k % 2
            if a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0:
                ans += 1
            break
    if l == r:
        ans += k >= a[l]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: T is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, stdin contains T-2 or T-3 test cases, n is at least 2, k is 0, l is at most n-1, r is at most n-1, a is a list of n non-negative integers, ans is at least 0 and at most n, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r], and t is either 0 or 1 depending on whether k is even or odd. If l is equal to r, ans is increased by 1 if k is greater than or equal to a[l], and the value of ans which is at least 0 and at most n is being printed
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: T is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, stdin contains T-3 or T-4 test cases, n is at least 2, k is 0, l is at least 0, r is at least 1, a is a list of n non-negative integers, ans is at least 0, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r], and t is either 0 or 1 depending on whether k is even or odd. If l is equal to r, then ans is equal to 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, and ans is printed
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: T is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, stdin contains T-4 or T-5 test cases, n is at least 2, k is 0, l is at least 0 and less than or equal to r, r is at least 1, a is a list of n non-negative integers, ans is at least 0 and at most n, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r], and t is equal to k % 2. If l is equal to r, ans is increased by 1 if k is greater than or equal to a[l], which is equivalent to a[r] since l is equal to r, and the value of ans is being printed


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
