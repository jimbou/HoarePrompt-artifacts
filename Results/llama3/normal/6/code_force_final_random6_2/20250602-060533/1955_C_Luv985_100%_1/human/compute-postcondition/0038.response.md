Postcondition: ***T is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, stdin contains T-2 or T-3 test cases, n is at least 2, k is at least 1 and is reduced by 2 times the minimum of a[l] and a[r], l is at most n-3 (or n-2 if mi * 2 is less than or equal to k and a[l] is 0), r is either n-2 (if a[r] is 0) or n-1 (otherwise), a is a list of n positive integers where a[0] is its original value minus mi, a[n-1] is its original value minus mi if mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, a[l] is reduced by mi, a[r] is reduced by mi, ans is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r], and t is either 0 or 1 depending on whether k is even or odd. If a[l] is 0, then l is at most n-2 (or n-1 if mi * 2 is less than or equal to k and a[l] is 0), and ans is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.***
