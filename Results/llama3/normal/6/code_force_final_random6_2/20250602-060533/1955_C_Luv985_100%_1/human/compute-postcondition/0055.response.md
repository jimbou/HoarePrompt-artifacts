Output State: **T is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, stdin contains T-3 or T-4 test cases, n is at least 2, k is greater than 0, l is 0, r is at least 1, a is a list of n non-negative integers, ans is 0, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[r], and t is not defined. The value of a[l] is decreased by mi, the value of a[r] is decreased by mi, and the value of k is decreased by mi * 2.**

In this output state, the values of T, n, k, l, r, ans, and t remain unchanged. The value of mi is still the minimum of a[0] and a[r], but a[0] and a[r] have both been decreased by mi. The value of k has been decreased by mi * 2, which is less than or equal to k, so k is still greater than 0.
