According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable T. If T is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, T is an integer, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to T is greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **T is greater than 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, where n is a positive integer and k is a non-negative integer. The second line contains n positive integers.**
