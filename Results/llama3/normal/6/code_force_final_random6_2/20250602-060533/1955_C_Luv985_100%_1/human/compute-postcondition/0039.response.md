Output State: **T is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, stdin contains T-2 or T-3 test cases, n is at least 2, k is at least 1, l is at most n-3 (or n-2 if mi * 2 is less than or equal to k and a[l] is 0), r is either n-2 (if a[r] is 0) or n-1 (otherwise), a is a list of n positive integers where a[0] is its original value minus mi and a[n-1] is its original value minus mi if mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, ans is 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r], and t is 0 if k is even and 1 if k is odd.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of t has been updated to reflect whether k is even (t=0) or odd (t=1). All other variables remain unchanged.
