Output State: **T is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, stdin contains T-2 or T-3 test cases, n is at least 2, k is at least 1 and is reduced by 2 times the minimum of a[l] and a[r], l is at most n-2 (or n-1 if mi * 2 is less than or equal to k and a[l] is 0), r is either n-2 (if a[r] is 0) or n-1 (otherwise), a is a list of n positive integers where a[0] is its original value minus mi, a[n-1] is its original value minus mi if mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, a[l] is reduced by mi, a[r] is reduced by mi, ans is 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r], and t is either 0 or 1 depending on whether k is even or odd.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `l` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is now 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, and the value of `l` is now at most `n-2` (or `n-1` if `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k` and `a[l]` is 0).
