Postcondition: **T is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, stdin contains T-4 or T-5 test cases, n is at least 2, k is 0, l is at least 0 and less than or equal to r, r is at least 1, a is a list of n non-negative integers, ans is at least 0 and at most n, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r], and t is equal to k % 2. If l is equal to r, ans is increased by 1 if k is greater than or equal to a[l], which is equivalent to a[r] since l is equal to r.**
