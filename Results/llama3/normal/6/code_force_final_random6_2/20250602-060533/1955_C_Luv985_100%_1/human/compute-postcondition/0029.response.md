Postcondition: ***T is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, stdin contains T-2 or T-3 test cases, n is at least 2, k is at least 2 times mi plus 1 if mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, a is a list of n positive integers where a[0] is its original value minus mi and a[n-1] is its original value minus mi if mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, l is at most n-2, r is n-1, ans is 1, 2, or 3 if a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0, otherwise ans is 0, 1, or 2, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r], and t is either 0 if k is even or 1 if k is odd.***
