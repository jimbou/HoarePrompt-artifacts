Postcondition: **T is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, stdin contains T-4 test cases, n is at least 2, k must be greater than 0, l is 0, r is at least 1, a is a list of n non-negative integers, ans is 0, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[r], and t is equal to k % 2. Additionally, the minimum of a[0] and a[r] multiplied by 2 is larger than k. The current value of a[l] minus t minus k divided by 2 equals 0.**
