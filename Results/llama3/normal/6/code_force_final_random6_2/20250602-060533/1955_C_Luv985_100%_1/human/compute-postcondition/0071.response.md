Output State: **T is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, stdin contains T-3 or T-4 test cases, n is at least 2, k is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 2 * mi, l is at least 0, r is at least 1, a is a list of n non-negative integers where a[l] has been decreased by 2 * mi and a[r] has been decreased by 2 * mi, ans is 1 if a[r] is 0 or a[l] is 0 or a[l] - t equals k/2, otherwise ans is 0, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r], and t is either 0 or 1 if mi * 2 > k, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r].**

The code snippet decreases the values of `a[l]` and `a[r]` by `mi`, and decreases `k` by `2 * mi`. The value of `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`. The value of `t` is either 0 or 1 if `mi * 2 > k`. The value of `ans` is 1 if `a[r]` is 0 or `a[l]` is 0 or `a[l] - t` equals `k/2`, otherwise it is 0. The values of `T`, `n`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged.
