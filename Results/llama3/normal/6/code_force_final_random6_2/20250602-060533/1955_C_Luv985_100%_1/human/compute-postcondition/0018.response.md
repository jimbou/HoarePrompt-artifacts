Output State: **T is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, n is at least 2, k is at least 1, a is a list of n positive integers, l is 0, r is n-1, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1], mi * 2 is larger than k, and t is either 0 or 1 depending on whether k is even or odd. If a[l] - t - k // 2 equals -1, then ans is 1. Otherwise, ans remains 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: T has decreased by 1, there are t-3 test cases left in stdin, and all other variables remain the same. Additionally, we have exited the most internal loop or if statement.
