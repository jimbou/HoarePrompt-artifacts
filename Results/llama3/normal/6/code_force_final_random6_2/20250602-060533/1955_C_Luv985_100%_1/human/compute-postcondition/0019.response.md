Postcondition: **T is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, stdin contains T-2 or T-3 test cases, n is at least 2, k is at least 1 and is equal to its original value minus 2 times mi if mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, a is a list of n positive integers where a[0] is its original value minus mi and a[n-1] is its original value minus mi if mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, l is 0 or 1, r is n-1, ans is 0, 1, or 2, and mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1] after the subtraction of mi from a[0] and a[n-1] if mi * 2 is less than or equal to k. If mi * 2 is larger than k, then t is either 0 or 1 depending on whether k is even or odd, and ans is 1 if a[l] - t - k // 2 equals -1, otherwise ans remains 0.**
