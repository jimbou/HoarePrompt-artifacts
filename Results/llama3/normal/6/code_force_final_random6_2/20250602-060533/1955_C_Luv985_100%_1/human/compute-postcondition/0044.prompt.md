Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases, n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer, a is a list of n positive integers, l is 0, r is n-1, ans is 0
Code of the loop:
while l < r and k > 0:
    mi = min(a[l], a[r])
    if mi * 2 <= k:
        a[l] -= mi
        a[r] -= mi
        k -= mi * 2
        if a[l] == 0:
            ans += 1
            l += 1
        if a[r] == 0:
            ans += 1
            r -= 1
    else:
        t = k % 2
        if a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0:
            ans += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: T is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, stdin contains T-2 or T-3 test cases, n is at least 2, k is at least 1 and is equal to its original value minus 2 times mi if mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, a is a list of n positive integers where a[0] is its original value minus mi and a[n-1] is its original value minus mi if mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, l is 0 or 1, r is n-1, ans is 0, 1, or 2, and mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1] after the subtraction of mi from a[0] and a[n-1] if mi * 2 is less than or equal to k. If mi * 2 is larger than k, then t is either 0 or 1 depending on whether k is even or odd, and ans is 1 if a[l] - t - k // 2 equals -1, otherwise ans remains 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: T is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, stdin contains T-2 or T-3 test cases, n is at least 2, k is at least 2 times mi plus 1 if mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, a is a list of n positive integers where a[0] is its original value minus mi and a[n-1] is its original value minus mi if mi * 2 is less than or equal to k. If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, then if a[l] is 0, l is at most n-1, ans is 2, 3, or 4 if a[r] is 0, otherwise ans is 1, 2, or 3, and mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r]. Otherwise, l is at most n-2, ans is 1, 2, or 3, and mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r]. In both cases, r is n-2 if a[r] is 0, otherwise r is n-1, and t is either 0 or 1 depending on whether k is even or odd if mi * 2 is larger than k. If mi * 2 is larger than k, then l is at most n-2, r is n-1, ans is 1, 2, or 3 if a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0, otherwise ans is 0, 1, or 2, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r], and t is either 0 if k is even or 1 if k is odd, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: T is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, stdin contains T-2 or T-3 test cases, n is at least 2, k is at least 1, l is at most n-3 (or n-2 if mi * 2 is less than or equal to k and a[l] is 0), r is either n-2 (if a[r] is 0) or n-1 (otherwise), a is a list of n positive integers where a[0] is its original value minus mi and a[n-1] is its original value minus mi if mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, ans is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r], and t is either 0 or 1 depending on whether k is even or odd. If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, then k is reduced by 2 times the minimum of a[l] and a[r], a[l] is reduced by mi, a[r] is reduced by mi. If a[l] is 0, then l is at most n-2 (or n-1 if mi * 2 is less than or equal to k and a[l] is 0), and ans is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. If mi * 2 is greater than k, then if a[l] - t - k // 2 equals 0, then ans is 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Otherwise, ans is 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
