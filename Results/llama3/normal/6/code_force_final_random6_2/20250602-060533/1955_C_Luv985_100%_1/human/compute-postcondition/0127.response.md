Postcondition: ***T is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, stdin contains T-4 or T-5 test cases, n is at least 2, k must remain greater than 0 after the last iteration's operations, l is 0 or 1, r is at least 1, a is a list of n non-negative integers, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[1] or the minimum of a[1] and a[r], and t is equal to k % 2. If a[l] - t - k // 2 equals 0, then ans is 1, 2, or 3. Otherwise, ans remains 0, 1, or 2.***
