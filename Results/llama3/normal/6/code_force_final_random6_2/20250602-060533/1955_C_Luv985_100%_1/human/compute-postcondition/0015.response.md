Postcondition: **T is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases, n is at least 2, k is at least 1, a is a list of n positive integers, l is 0, r is n-1, ans is 0, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1], mi * 2 is larger than k, and t is either 0 or 1 depending on whether k is even or odd. The current value of a[l] minus t minus k divided by 2 equals 0.**
