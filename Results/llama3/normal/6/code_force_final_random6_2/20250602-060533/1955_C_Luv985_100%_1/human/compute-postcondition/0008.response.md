Output State: **T is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, stdin contains T-2 test cases, n is at least 2, k is at least 1 and is equal to its original value minus 2 times mi, a is a list of n positive integers where a[0] is its original value minus mi and a[n-1] is its original value minus mi, l is 1, r is n-1, ans is 1, and mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1] after the subtraction of mi from a[0] and a[n-1]. The current value of a[l] is not necessarily 0.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `l` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `a[l]` is no longer guaranteed to be 0, as the value of `l` has changed.
