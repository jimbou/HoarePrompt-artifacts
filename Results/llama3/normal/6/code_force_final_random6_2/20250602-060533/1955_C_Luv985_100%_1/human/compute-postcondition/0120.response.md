Output State: **T is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, stdin contains T-4 or T-5 test cases, n is at least 2, k is greater than 0, l is 0 or 1, r is at least 1, a is a list of n non-negative integers with a[l] and a[r] decreased by mi, ans is 0, 1, or 2, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[1] or the minimum of a[1] and a[r] but now decreased by mi, and t is not defined or equal to k % 2.**

In this output state, the value of T remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The number of test cases in stdin also remains the same. The value of n is still at least 2, and k is still greater than 0. The value of l is still 0 or 1, and r is still at least 1. The list a has been modified, with the values at indices l and r decreased by mi. The value of ans is still 0, 1, or 2. The value of mi has been decreased by mi, and the value of t is still not defined or equal to k % 2.
