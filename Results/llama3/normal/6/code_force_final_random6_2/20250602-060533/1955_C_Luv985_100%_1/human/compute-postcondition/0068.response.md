Postcondition: **T is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, stdin contains T-3 or T-4 test cases, n is at least 2, k is greater than 0 and has been decreased by mi * 2 if mi * 2 <= k, l is at least 0, r is at least 1, a is a list of n non-negative integers where a[l] has been decreased by mi and a[r] has been decreased by mi if mi * 2 <= k, ans is 1 if a[r] is 0 or a[l] is 0 or a[l] - t equals k/2, otherwise ans is 0, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[r], and t is either 0 or 1 if mi * 2 > k.**
