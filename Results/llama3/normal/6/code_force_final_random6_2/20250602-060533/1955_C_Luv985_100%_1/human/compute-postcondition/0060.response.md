Output State: **T is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, stdin contains T-3 or T-4 test cases, n is at least 2, k is greater than 0 and has been decreased by mi * 2, l is at least 0, r is at least 0, a is a list of n non-negative integers where a[l] has been decreased by mi, a[r] has been decreased by mi and is currently 0, ans is 1, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[r], and t is not defined. If a[l] is 0, then l is at least 1.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. The value of `r` has been decremented by 1, making it at least 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
