Postcondition: **T is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, stdin contains T-4 test cases, n is at least 2, k is greater than 0 and is equal to its original value minus 2 times mi, a is a list of n non-negative integers where a[r] is a[r] - mi, ans is 2 if a[r] is 0, otherwise ans is 1 if a[l] is 0, otherwise ans is 0, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[r], l is 1 if a[l] is 0, otherwise l is 0, r is at least 1, and t is not defined.**
