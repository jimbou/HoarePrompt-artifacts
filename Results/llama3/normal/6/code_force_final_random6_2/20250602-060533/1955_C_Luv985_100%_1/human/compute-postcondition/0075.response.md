Postcondition: **T is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, stdin contains T-3 or T-4 test cases, n is at least 2, k is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 2 * mi, l is at least 0, r is at least 1, a is a list of n non-negative integers where a[l] has been decreased by 2 * mi and a[r] has been decreased by 2 * mi, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r], and t is either 0 or 1 if mi * 2 > k. If a[l] is 0, then ans is 2 if a[r] is not 0 and a[l] - t does not equal k/2, otherwise ans is 3. If a[l] is not 0, then ans is 1 if a[r] is not 0 and a[l] - t does not equal k/2, otherwise ans is 2.**
