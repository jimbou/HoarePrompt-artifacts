Output State: **T is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, stdin contains T-5 test cases, n is at least 2, k must be greater than 0, l is 0, r is at least 1, a is a list of n non-negative integers, and t is equal to k % 2. Additionally, the minimum of a[0] and a[r] multiplied by 2 is larger than k. If the current value of a[l] minus t minus k divided by 2 equals 0, then ans is 1. Otherwise, ans remains 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of T has been decreased by 1 and we have T-5 test cases left in stdin. The values of n, k, l, r, a, and t remain the same. The condition that the minimum of a[0] and a[r] multiplied by 2 is larger than k still holds. The value of ans is either 0 or 1 depending on the condition that the current value of a[l] minus t minus k divided by 2 equals 0. We have also broken out of the most internal loop or if statement.
