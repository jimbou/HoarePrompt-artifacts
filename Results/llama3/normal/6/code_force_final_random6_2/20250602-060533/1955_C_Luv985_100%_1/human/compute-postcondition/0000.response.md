Output State: **T is an integer, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, where n is a positive integer and k is a non-negative integer. The second line contains n positive integers.**

The code reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to T. Since stdin contains t test cases, after reading one integer, there are t-1 test cases left. The state of T is now an integer, and the state of stdin is updated to contain t-1 test cases.
