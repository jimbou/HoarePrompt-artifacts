Output State: **T is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, stdin contains T-3 or T-4 test cases, n is at least 2, k must be greater than 0, l is 0, r is at least 1, a is a list of n non-negative integers, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[r], and t is either 0 or 1. The minimum of a[0] and a[r] is more than k/2. If the current value of a[l] minus t and k divided by 2 equals 0, then ans is 1. Otherwise, ans remains 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables T, n, k, l, r, a, mi, and t remain the same, and the conditions on these variables are still valid. The only change is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
