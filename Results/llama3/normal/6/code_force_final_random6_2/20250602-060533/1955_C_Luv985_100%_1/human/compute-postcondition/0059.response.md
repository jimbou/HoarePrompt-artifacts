Postcondition: ***T is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, stdin contains T-3 or T-4 test cases, n is at least 2, k is greater than 0 and has been decreased by mi * 2, l is at least 0, r is at least 1, a is a list of n non-negative integers where a[l] has been decreased by mi, a[r] has been decreased by mi and is currently 0, ans is 0 or 1, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[r], and t is not defined. If a[l] is 0, then ans is 1 and l is at least 1. Otherwise, ans is 0.***
