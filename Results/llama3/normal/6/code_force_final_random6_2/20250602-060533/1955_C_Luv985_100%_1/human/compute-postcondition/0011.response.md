Output State: **T is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, stdin contains T-2 test cases, n is at least 2, k is at least 1 and is equal to its original value minus 2 times mi, a is a list of n positive integers where a[0] is its original value minus mi and a[n-1] is its original value minus mi. If a[l] is 0, then l is 1, r is n-1, ans is 2, and mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1] after the subtraction of mi from a[0] and a[n-1]. Otherwise, the values of l, r, ans, and mi remain unchanged. The current value of a[r-1] is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, making it 2. The value of `r` has been decremented by 1, making `a[r-1]` equal to 0. All other variables remain unchanged, retaining their original values and relationships as specified in the initial state.
