Output State: **T is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, stdin contains T-4 test cases, n is at least 2, k must be greater than 0, l is 0, r is at least 1, a is a list of n non-negative integers, ans is 0, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[r], and t is equal to k % 2. Additionally, the minimum of a[0] and a[r] multiplied by 2 is larger than k**

In this output state, the value of t is now defined and is equal to the remainder of k divided by 2. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on T, n, k, l, r, a, ans, and mi are still valid. The relationship between the minimum of a[0] and a[r] and k is also still valid.
