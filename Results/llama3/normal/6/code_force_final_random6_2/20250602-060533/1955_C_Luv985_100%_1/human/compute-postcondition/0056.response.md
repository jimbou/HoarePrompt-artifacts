Postcondition: **T is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, stdin contains T-3 or T-4 test cases, n is at least 2, k is greater than 0, l is 0, r is at least 1, a is a list of n non-negative integers, ans is 0, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[r], and t is not defined. The value of a[l] was decreased by mi, the value of a[r] was decreased by mi, and the value of k was decreased by mi * 2. The current value of a[l] is 0.**
