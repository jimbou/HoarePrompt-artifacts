Output State: **T is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, stdin contains T-4 or T-5 test cases, n is at least 2, k is 0, l is at least 0 and less than or equal to r, r is at least 1, a is a list of n non-negative integers, ans is at least 0 and at most n, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r], and t is equal to k % 2. The current value of l is equal to r. ans is increased by 1 if k is greater than or equal to a[l], which is equivalent to a[r] since l is equal to r.**

In natural language, the output state is: T is still greater than 0 but has been decreased by 1, there are T-4 or T-5 test cases left in the input, n is still at least 2, k is still 0, l is still at least 0 and less than or equal to r, r is still at least 1, a is still a list of n non-negative integers, ans is still at least 0 and at most n, mi is still the minimum of a[l] and a[r], and t is still equal to k % 2. The current value of l is still equal to r. The value of ans has been increased by 1 if k is greater than or equal to a[l], which is equivalent to a[r] since l is equal to r.
