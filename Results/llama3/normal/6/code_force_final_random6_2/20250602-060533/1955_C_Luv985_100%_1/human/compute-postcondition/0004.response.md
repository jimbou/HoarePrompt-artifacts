Output State: **T is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases, n is at least 2, k is at least 1, a is a list of n positive integers, l is 0, r is n-1, ans is 0, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1].**

In this output state, the value of `mi` is the minimum of the first and last elements of the list `a`, which are `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.
