Postcondition: ***T is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, stdin contains T-2 test cases, n is at least 2, k is at least 1 and is equal to its original value minus 2 times mi, a is a list of n positive integers where a[0] is its original value minus mi and a[n-1] is its original value minus mi. If a[l] is 0, then l is 1, r is n-1, ans is 1, and mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1] after the subtraction of mi from a[0] and a[n-1]. Otherwise, the values of l, r, ans, and mi remain unchanged. The current value of a[r] is 0.***
