Output State: **T is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, stdin contains T-4 or T-5 test cases, n is at least 2, k is greater than 0, r is at least 0, a is a list of n non-negative integers with a[l] and a[r] decreased by mi, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[1] or the minimum of a[1] and a[r] but now decreased by mi, t is not defined or equal to k % 2. If a[l] is 0, then l is 1 and ans is 2, 3, or 4. Otherwise, l is 0 or 1 and ans is 1, 2, or 3.**
