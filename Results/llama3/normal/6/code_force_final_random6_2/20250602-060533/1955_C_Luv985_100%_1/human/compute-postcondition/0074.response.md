Output State: **T is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, stdin contains T-3 or T-4 test cases, n is at least 2, k is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 2 * mi, l is at least 0, r is at least 0, a is a list of n non-negative integers where a[l] has been decreased by 2 * mi and a[r] has been decreased by 2 * mi, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r], and t is either 0 or 1 if mi * 2 > k. If a[l] is 0, then ans is 3 if a[r] is 0 or a[l] - t equals k/2, otherwise ans is 2. If a[l] is not 0, then ans is 2 if a[r] is 0 or a[l] - t equals k/2, otherwise ans is 1.**

The code increments the value of `ans` by 1 and decrements the value of `r` by 1. The initial state of `ans` depends on the values of `a[l]`, `a[r]`, and `t`. If `a[l]` is 0, then `ans` is initially 2 if `a[r]` is 0 or `a[l] - t` equals `k/2`, otherwise `ans` is 1. If `a[l]` is not 0, then `ans` is initially 1 if `a[r]` is 0 or `a[l] - t` equals `k/2`, otherwise `ans` is 0. After incrementing `ans` by 1, its value changes accordingly. The decrement of `r` by 1 changes its value to at least 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
