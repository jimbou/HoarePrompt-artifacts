Output State: **T is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, stdin contains T-4 or T-5 test cases, n is at least 2, k is greater than 0 and has been decreased by mi * 2, r is at least 0, l is less than or equal to r, a is a list of n non-negative integers where a[l] and a[r] have been decreased by mi, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r] after the decrease, t is equal to k % 2, and ans is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `r` has been decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `l` and `r` has been updated to `l is less than or equal to r` because `r` has been decremented. The rest of the information from the precondition remains valid.
