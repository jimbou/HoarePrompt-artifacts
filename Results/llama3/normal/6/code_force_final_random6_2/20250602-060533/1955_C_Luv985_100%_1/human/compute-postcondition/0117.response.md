Postcondition: ***T is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, stdin contains T-4 or T-5 test cases, n is at least 2, k is greater than 0, l is 0 or 1, r is at least 1, a is a list of n non-negative integers, ans is 0, 1, or 2, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[r], and t is not defined or equal to k % 2. If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, then k is equal to its original value minus 2 times mi, a[r] is a[r] - mi, and ans is 2 if a[r] is 0, otherwise ans is 1 if a[l] is 0, otherwise ans is 0. If mi * 2 is larger than k, then t is equal to k % 2, and if the current value of a[l] minus t minus k divided by 2 equals 0, then ans is 1, otherwise ans remains 0.***
