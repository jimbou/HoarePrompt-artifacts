Output State: **T is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, stdin contains T-2 or T-3 test cases, n is at least 2, k is 0, l is at most n-1, r is at most n-1, a is a list of n non-negative integers, ans is at least 0 and at most n, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r], and t is either 0 or 1 depending on whether k is even or odd.**

This output state means that after the loop executes all its iterations, the value of T has been decreased by 1, and there are T-2 or T-3 test cases left in stdin. The value of n remains at least 2, and the value of k has been reduced to 0. The value of l is at most n-1, and the value of r is at most n-1. The list a contains n non-negative integers, and the value of ans is at least 0 and at most n. The value of mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r], and the value of t is either 0 or 1 depending on whether k is even or odd.
