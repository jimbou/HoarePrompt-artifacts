Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, stdin contains T-3 or T-4 test cases, n is at least 2, k is at least 0, l is 0, r is at least 1, a is a list of n non-negative integers, ans is 0, mi is not defined, and t is not defined.
Code of the loop:
while l < r and k > 0:
    mi = min(a[l], a[r])
    if mi * 2 <= k:
        a[l] -= mi
        a[r] -= mi
        k -= mi * 2
        if a[l] == 0:
            ans += 1
            l += 1
        if a[r] == 0:
            ans += 1
            r -= 1
    else:
        t = k % 2
        if a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0:
            ans += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: T is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, stdin contains T-3 or T-4 test cases, n is at least 2, k is greater than 0 and has been decreased by mi * 2 if mi * 2 <= k, l is at least 0, r is at least 1, a is a list of n non-negative integers where a[l] has been decreased by mi and a[r] has been decreased by mi if mi * 2 <= k, ans is 1 if a[r] is 0 or a[l] is 0 or a[l] - t equals k/2, otherwise ans is 0, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[r], and t is either 0 or 1 if mi * 2 > k.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: T is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, stdin contains T-3 or T-4 test cases, n is at least 2, k is greater than 0, l is at least 0, r is at least 1, a is a list of n non-negative integers, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r], and t is either 0 or 1 if mi * 2 > k. If mi * 2 <= k, then k has been decreased by 2 * mi, a[l] has been decreased by 2 * mi, and a[r] has been decreased by 2 * mi. If a[l] is 0, then ans is 2 if a[r] is not 0 and a[l] - t does not equal k/2, otherwise ans is 3. If a[l] is not 0, then ans is 1 if a[r] is not 0 and a[l] - t does not equal k/2, otherwise ans is 2. If mi * 2 > k, then k has not been decreased to 0, a[l] has been decreased by mi, and a[r] has been decreased by mi. If a[r] is 0 or a[l] is 0 or a[l] - t equals k/2 and a[l] - t - k // 2 equals 0, then ans is 2, otherwise ans is 1. t is either 0 or 1 depending on whether k is even or odd, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: T is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, stdin contains T-3 or T-4 test cases, n is at least 2, k is greater than 0 after the decrease, l is at least 0, r is at least 1, a is a list of n non-negative integers, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r], t is either 0 or 1 depending on whether k is even or odd. If mi * 2 <= k, then k has been decreased by 2 * mi, a[l] has been decreased by 2 * mi, and a[r] has been decreased by 2 * mi. If a[l] is 0, then ans is 2 if a[r] is not 0 and a[l] - t does not equal k/2, otherwise ans is 3. If a[l] is not 0, then ans is 1 if a[r] is not 0 and a[l] - t does not equal k/2, otherwise ans is 2. If mi * 2 > k, then k has not been decreased to 0, a[l] has been decreased by mi, and a[r] has been decreased by mi. If a[r] is 0 or a[l] is 0 or a[l] - t equals k/2 and a[l] - t - k // 2 equals 0, then ans is 2, otherwise ans is 1. If a[l] is 0, then ans has been increased by 1. If a[r] is 0, then r has been decreased by 1. If a[l] - t - k // 2 equals 0, then ans has been increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
