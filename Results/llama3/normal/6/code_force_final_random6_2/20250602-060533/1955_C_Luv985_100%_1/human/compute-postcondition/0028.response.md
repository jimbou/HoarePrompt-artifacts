Output State: **`T` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, stdin contains `T-2` or `T-3` test cases, `n` is at least 2, `k` is at least 2 times `mi` plus 1 if `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where `a[0]` is its original value minus `mi` and `a[n-1]` is its original value minus `mi` if `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` is at most `n-2`, `r` is `n-1`, `ans` is 1, 2, or 3, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, and `t` is either 0 if `k` is even or 1 if `k` is odd.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, so it can now be 1, 2, or 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
