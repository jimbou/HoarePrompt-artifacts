Output State: **T is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, stdin contains T-3 or T-4 test cases, n is at least 2, k must be greater than 0, l is 0, r is at least 1, a is a list of n non-negative integers, ans is 1, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[r], and t is either 0 or 1. The minimum of a[0] and a[r] is more than k/2. The current value of a[l] minus t and k divided by 2 equals 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, and it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin is still T-3 or T-4. The list `a` still contains n non-negative integers, and the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[r]` is still more than `k/2`. The relationship between `a[l]`, `t`, and `k` remains the same.
