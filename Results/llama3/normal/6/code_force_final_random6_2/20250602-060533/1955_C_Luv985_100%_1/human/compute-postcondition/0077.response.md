Output State: **`T` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, stdin contains `T-3` or `T-4` test cases, `n` is at least 2, `k` is greater than 0 and has not been decreased to 0, `l` is at least 0, `r` is at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers where `a[l]` has been decreased by `mi` and `a[r]` has been decreased by `mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`, `ans` is 2 if `a[r]` is 0 or `a[l]` is 0 or `a[l] - t` equals `k/2`, otherwise `ans` is 1, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, and `t` is either 0 or 1 if `mi * 2 > k`, `t` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `k` is even or odd.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2 if the previous conditions for `ans` being 1 were met, and 1 otherwise. The other variables remain unchanged.
