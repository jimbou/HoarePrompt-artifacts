Output State: **T is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases, n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer, a is a list of n positive integers, l is 0, r is n-1, ans is 0**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

After executing the code, the value of T has decreased by 1, but it is still greater than 0. The number of test cases in stdin has also decreased by 1, leaving t-2 test cases. The variables n and k have been assigned values from the first line of the current test case, with n being a positive integer and k being a non-negative integer. The list a now contains n positive integers from the second line of the current test case. The variables l and r have been initialized to 0 and n-1, respectively. The variable ans has been initialized to 0.
