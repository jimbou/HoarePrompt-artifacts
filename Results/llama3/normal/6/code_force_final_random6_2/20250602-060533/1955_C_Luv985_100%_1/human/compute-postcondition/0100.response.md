Output State: **T is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, stdin contains T-4 test cases, n is at least 2, k is at least 0, l is 0, r is at least 1, a is a list of n non-negative integers, ans is 0, mi is not defined, and t is not defined.**

The code snippet modifies the initial state in the following ways:

*   `T` is decreased by 1, so it remains greater than 0.
*   The first line of input from stdin is consumed, leaving T-4 test cases.
*   `n` is assigned a new value from the input, which is at least 2.
*   `k` is assigned a new value from the input, which is at least 0.
*   `a` is assigned a new list of n non-negative integers from the input.
*   `l` is set to 0.
*   `r` is set to n-1, which is at least 1.
*   `ans` is reset to 0.
*   `mi` and `t` are not defined after the code execution because they are not assigned any values in the given code snippet.
