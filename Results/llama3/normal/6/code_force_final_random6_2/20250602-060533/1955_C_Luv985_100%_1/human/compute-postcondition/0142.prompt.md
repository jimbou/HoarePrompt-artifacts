Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, stdin contains T-4 test cases, n is at least 2, k is at least 0, l is 0, r is at least 1, a is a list of n non-negative integers, ans is 0, mi is not defined, and t is not defined.
Code of the loop:
while l < r and k > 0:
    mi = min(a[l], a[r])
    if mi * 2 <= k:
        a[l] -= mi
        a[r] -= mi
        k -= mi * 2
        if a[l] == 0:
            ans += 1
            l += 1
        if a[r] == 0:
            ans += 1
            r -= 1
    else:
        t = k % 2
        if a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0:
            ans += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *T is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, stdin contains T-4 or T-5 test cases, n is at least 2, k is greater than 0, l is 0 or 1, r is at least 1, a is a list of n non-negative integers, ans is 0, 1, or 2, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[r], and t is not defined or equal to k % 2. If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, then k is equal to its original value minus 2 times mi, a[r] is a[r] - mi, and ans is 2 if a[r] is 0, otherwise ans is 1 if a[l] is 0, otherwise ans is 0. If mi * 2 is larger than k, then t is equal to k % 2, and if the current value of a[l] minus t minus k divided by 2 equals 0, then ans is 1, otherwise ans remains 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *T is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, stdin contains T-4 or T-5 test cases, n is at least 2, k is greater than 0, r is at least 1, a is a list of n non-negative integers, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[1] or the minimum of a[1] and a[r], and t is equal to k % 2. If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, then a[l] and a[r] are decreased by mi. If a[r] is 0, then if a[l] is 0, l is 1 and ans is 2, 3, or 4. Otherwise, l is 0 or 1 and ans is 1, 2, or 3. If a[r] is not 0, then if a[l] is 0, l is 1 and ans is 1, 2, or 3. Otherwise, l is 0 or 1 and ans is 0, 1, or 2. If mi * 2 is greater than k, then if a[l] - t - k // 2 equals 0, then ans is 1, 2, or 3. Otherwise, ans remains 0, 1, or 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *T is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, stdin contains T-4 or T-5 test cases, n is at least 2, k is greater than 0, r is at least 1 and l is less than r, a is a list of n non-negative integers, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r], and t is equal to k % 2. If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, then a[l] and a[r] are decreased by mi. If a[r] is 0, then if a[l] is 0, l is 1 and ans is 2, 3, or 4. Otherwise, l is 0 or 1 and ans is 1, 2, or 3. If a[r] is not 0, then if a[l] is 0, l is 1 and ans is 1, 2, or 3. Otherwise, l is 0 or 1 and ans is 0, 1, or 2. If mi * 2 is greater than k, then if a[l] - t - k // 2 equals 0, then ans is 1, 2, or 3. Otherwise, ans remains 0, 1, or 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If a[l] is 0, then l has been incremented by 1 and ans has been incremented by 1. If a[r] is 0, then ans has been incremented by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
