Postcondition: ***T is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, stdin contains T-3 or T-4 test cases, n is at least 2, k is 0, l is at least 0, r is at least 1, a is a list of n non-negative integers, ans is at least 0, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r], and t is either 0 or 1 depending on whether k is even or odd. If l is equal to r, then ans is equal to 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
