Output State: **T is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, stdin contains T-2 test cases, n is at least 2, k is at least 1 and is equal to its original value minus 2 times mi, a is a list of n positive integers where a[0] is its original value minus mi and a[n-1] is its original value minus mi, l is 0, r is n-1, ans is 0, and mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1] after the subtraction of mi from a[0] and a[n-1].**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been reduced by twice the value of `mi`, which is the minimum of the original values of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`. The values of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` have been decreased by `mi`. The value of `mi` has been updated to be the minimum of the new values of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
