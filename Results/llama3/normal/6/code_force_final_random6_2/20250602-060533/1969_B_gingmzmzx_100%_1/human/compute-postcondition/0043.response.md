The code prints the total count of zeroes in the last binary string `s` that are followed by at least one one.
Since the exact binary string `s` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the total count of zeroes in the last binary string `s` that are followed by at least one one.
Output: **ans (where ans is the total count of zeroes in the last binary string s that are followed by at least one one)**
