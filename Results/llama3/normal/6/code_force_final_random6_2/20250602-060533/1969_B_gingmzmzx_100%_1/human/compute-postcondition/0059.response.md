To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `c` and `s`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `c` is the second integer in the list `s`, and `s` has at least 2 integers. For the loop to execute again, `s` must have at least 3 integers. Therefore, we can adjust the state of `s` to have at least 3 integers.

Since `c` is the second integer in the list `s`, for the loop to execute again, `c` should be the third integer in the list `s`.

The other variables `_`, `n`, `zeroes`, `cnt`, and `ans` are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `c` is the third integer in the list `s`, `zeroes` is the count of zeroes in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list of two integers where `cnt[0]` is either `zeroes` or `zeroes + 1` and `cnt[1]` is either `cnt[1]` or `cnt[1] + 1` and is now increased by 1 at the index c, and `ans` is either 1 or 0 or -1 depending on whether `c` is 0, `cnt[1]` is greater than 0 or `c` is not equal to 0 respectively, and stdin is empty.**
