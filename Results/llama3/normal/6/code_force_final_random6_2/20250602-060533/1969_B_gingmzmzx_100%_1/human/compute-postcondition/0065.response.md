The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the sum of the counts of ones in the list `s` and the count of zeroes in the list `s` minus the count of zeroes in the list `s`.

Since `s` is an empty list, the count of zeroes and ones in `s` is 0. Therefore, `cnt[0]` (the count of zeroes) and `cnt[1]` (the count of ones) are both 0.

The value of `ans` is calculated as the sum of `cnt[1]` (the count of ones) and `cnt[0]` (the count of zeroes) minus `cnt[0]` (the count of zeroes). Since all these values are 0, `ans` is also 0.

Output: **0**
