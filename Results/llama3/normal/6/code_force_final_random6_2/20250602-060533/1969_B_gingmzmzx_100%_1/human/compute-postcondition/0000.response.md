The code `n = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by `t` lines, each containing a binary string `s` (2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5). The integer `t` is assigned to `n`. The remaining input in stdin is `t` lines, each containing a binary string `s` (2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5).

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `n` lines, each containing a binary string `s` (2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5).**
