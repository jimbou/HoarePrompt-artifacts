The code `cnt[c] += 1` increments the count of the value `c` in the list `cnt` by 1. Since `c` is the first integer in the list `s`, and `cnt` is a list of two integers where `cnt[0]` is the count of zeroes in the list `s` and `cnt[1]` is the count of ones in the list `s`, the value of `c` can be either 0 or 1.

If `c` is 0, then `cnt[0]` is incremented by 1, and the new value of `cnt[0]` is `zeroes + 1`. If `c` is 1, then `cnt[1]` is incremented by 1, and the new value of `cnt[1]` is `cnt[1] + 1`.

The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `c` is the first integer in the list `s`, `zeroes` is the count of zeroes in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list of two integers where `cnt[0]` is either `zeroes` or `zeroes + 1` and `cnt[1]` is either `cnt[1]` or `cnt[1] + 1`, `ans` is 0, and stdin is empty.**
