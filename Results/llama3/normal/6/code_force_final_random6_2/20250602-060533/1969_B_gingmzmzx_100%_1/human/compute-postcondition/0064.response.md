Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 2, s is an empty list, c is the last integer in the list s, zeroes is the count of zeroes in the list s, cnt is a list of two integers where cnt[0] is the count of zeroes in the list s and cnt[1] is the count of ones in the list s, ans is the sum of the counts of ones in the list s and the count of zeroes in the list s minus the count of zeroes in the list s, and stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `s` is empty, the variable `c` is the last integer in the list `s`, the count of zeroes and ones in the list `s` is stored in the list `cnt`, and the variable `ans` is the sum of the counts of ones and zeroes in the list `s` minus the count of zeroes in the list `s`. The other variables `_` and `n` remain unchanged.
