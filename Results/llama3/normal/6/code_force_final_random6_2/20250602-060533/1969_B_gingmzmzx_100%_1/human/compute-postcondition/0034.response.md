Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `s` is a list of integers representing the binary string from the last line of stdin that must have at least 2 integers, `c` is the second integer in the list `s`, `zeroes` is the count of zeroes in the last binary string `s`, `cnt` is a list of two integers where `cnt[0]` is the count of zeroes in the last binary string `s` and `cnt[1]` is the count of ones in the last binary string `s` incremented by 1 if `c` is 1, `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is 1 plus the initial value of `ans` if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, otherwise `ans` is the initial value of `ans` if `cnt[1]` is not greater than 0, and `stdin` is empty**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state except for the value of `ans`. If `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, `ans` is incremented by 1, otherwise it remains the same. The value of `ans` depends on the initial value of `ans` and the value of `cnt[1]`.
