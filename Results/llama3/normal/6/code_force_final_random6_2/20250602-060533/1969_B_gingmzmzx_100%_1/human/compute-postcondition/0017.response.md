Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains n-1 lines, each containing a binary string s (2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5), _ is 0, s is a list of integers representing a binary string that has at least 3 elements, c is the third element in the list s, zeroes is the count of zeroes in s, cnt is a list of two integers where cnt[c] is increased by 1 and cnt[1-c] is 0. If the first element c in s is 0, then ans is increased by 1 if cnt[1] > 0, otherwise ans remains the same. If the first element c in s is 1, then ans is zeroes - cnt[0] + zeroes - cnt[0].**

The code increments the value of `ans` by 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, otherwise it remains the same. Since `cnt[1]` is 0 or 1, `ans` is increased by 1 only if `cnt[1]` is 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
