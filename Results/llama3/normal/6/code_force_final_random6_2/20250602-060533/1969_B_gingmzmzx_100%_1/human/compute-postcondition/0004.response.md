Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains n-1 lines, each containing a binary string s (2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5), _ is 0, s is a list of integers representing a binary string that is not empty, zeroes is the count of zeroes in s, cnt is a list of two integers where cnt[c] is increased by 1 and cnt[1-c] is 0, ans is 0, c is the first element in s**

The code increments the count of the first element in the binary string s in the cnt list. The value of c is either 0 or 1, so cnt[c] is either cnt[0] or cnt[1]. Since cnt is a list of two integers both equal to 0 initially, after the increment, cnt[c] will be 1 and cnt[1-c] will remain 0. The other variables are not affected by the code.
