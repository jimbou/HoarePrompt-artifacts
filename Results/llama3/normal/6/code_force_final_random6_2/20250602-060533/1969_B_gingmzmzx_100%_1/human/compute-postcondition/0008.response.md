Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains n-1 lines, each containing a binary string s (2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5), _ is 0, s is a list of integers representing a binary string that is not empty, zeroes is the count of zeroes in s, cnt is a list of two integers where cnt[c] is increased by 1 and cnt[1-c] is 0, ans is zeroes - cnt[0], c is the first element in s and c is 1**

The code increments the value of `ans` by the difference between the count of zeroes in the binary string `s` and the count of zeroes in the list `cnt`. Since `c` is 1, `cnt[0]` is 0, so `ans` is now equal to the count of zeroes in `s`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
