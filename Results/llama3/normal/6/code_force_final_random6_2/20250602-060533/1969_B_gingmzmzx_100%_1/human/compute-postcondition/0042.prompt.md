Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 1, s is a list of integers representing the binary string from the last line of stdin, zeroes is the count of zeroes in the last binary string s, cnt is a list of two integers where cnt[0] is the count of zeroes in the last binary string s and cnt[1] is the count of ones in the last binary string s, ans is 0, and stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
for c in s:
    cnt[c] += 1
    if c == 0:
        ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
    else:
        ans += zeroes - cnt[0]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `s` is a list of integers representing the binary string from the last line of stdin that must have at least 1 integer, `c` is the first integer in the list `s`, `zeroes` is the count of zeroes in the last binary string `s`, `cnt` is a list of two integers where `cnt[0]` is the count of zeroes in the last binary string `s` and `cnt[1]` is the count of ones in the last binary string `s` incremented by 1 if `c` is 1, `ans` is 1 if `c` is 0 and `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, otherwise `ans` is 0 if `c` is 0, and `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0]` if `c` is not 0, and `stdin` is empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `s` is a list of integers representing the binary string from the last line of stdin that must have at least 2 integers, `c` is the second integer in the list `s`, `zeroes` is the count of zeroes in the last binary string `s`, `cnt` is a list of two integers where `cnt[0]` is the count of zeroes in the last binary string `s` and `cnt[1]` is the count of ones in the last binary string `s` incremented by 1 if `c` is 1, `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is updated based on the value of `c` and `cnt[1]`. If `c` is 0, `ans` is 1 plus the initial value of `ans` if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, otherwise `ans` is the initial value of `ans` if `cnt[1]` is not greater than 0. If `c` is not 0, `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0] + zeroes - cnt[0]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `s` is a list of integers representing the binary string from the last line of stdin that must have at least 3 integers, `c` is the third integer in the list `s`, `zeroes` is the count of zeroes in the last binary string `s`, `cnt` is a list of two integers where `cnt[0]` is the count of zeroes in the last binary string `s` and `cnt[1]` is the count of ones in the last binary string `s` incremented by 1 if `c` is 1, `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is updated based on the value of `c` and `cnt[1]`. If `c` is 0, `ans` is 1 plus the initial value of `ans` if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, otherwise `ans` is the initial value of `ans` if `cnt[1]` is not greater than 0. If `c` is not 0, `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0] + zeroes - cnt[0]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
