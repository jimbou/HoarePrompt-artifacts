The only variable in the loop head is variable  c and s, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `s` is a list of integers representing a binary string, so it needs to be adjusted to `s` is not empty and `c` is the first element in `s`. 
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains n-1 lines, each containing a binary string s (2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5), _ is 0, s is a list of integers representing a binary string that is not empty, zeroes is the count of zeroes in s, cnt is a list of two integers both equal to 0, ans is 0, c is the first element in s**
