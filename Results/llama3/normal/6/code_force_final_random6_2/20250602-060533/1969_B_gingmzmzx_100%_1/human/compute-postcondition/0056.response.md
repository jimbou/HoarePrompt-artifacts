Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `c` is the second integer in the list `s`, `zeroes` is the count of zeroes in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list of two integers where `cnt[0]` is either `zeroes` or `zeroes + 1` and `cnt[1]` is either `cnt[1]` or `cnt[1] + 1` and is now increased by 1 at the index c, and `ans` is either 1 or 0 or -1 depending on whether `c` is 0, `cnt[1]` is greater than 0 or `c` is not equal to 0 respectively, and stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated based on the condition `cnt[1] > 0`. If `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, `ans` is incremented by 1, otherwise it remains the same. The other variables remain unchanged.
