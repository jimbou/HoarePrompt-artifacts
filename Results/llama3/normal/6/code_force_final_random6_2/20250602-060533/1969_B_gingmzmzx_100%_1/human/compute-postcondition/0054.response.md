To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `c` and `s`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `s` has at least one more integer. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has at least 1 integer, and `c` is the first integer in the list `s`. For the loop to execute again, `s` must have at least 2 integers, and `c` must be the second integer in the list `s`.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `c` is the second integer in the list `s`, `zeroes` is the count of zeroes in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list of two integers where `cnt[0]` is either `zeroes` or `zeroes + 1` and `cnt[1]` is either `cnt[1]` or `cnt[1] + 1`, and `ans` is either 0, 1 or -1 depending on whether `c` is 0, `cnt[1]` is greater than 0 or `c` is not equal to 0 respectively, and stdin is empty.**
