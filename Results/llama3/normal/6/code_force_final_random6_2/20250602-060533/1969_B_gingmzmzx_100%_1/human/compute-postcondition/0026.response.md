Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `s` is a list of integers representing the binary string from the last line of stdin that must have at least 1 integer, `c` is the first integer in the list `s`, `zeroes` is the count of zeroes in the last binary string `s`, `cnt` is a list of two integers where `cnt[0]` is the count of zeroes in the last binary string `s` and `cnt[1]` is the count of ones in the last binary string `s` incremented by 1 if `c` is 1, `ans` is 0, and `stdin` is empty**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt` is updated based on the value of `c`. If `c` is 0, the count of zeroes in `cnt` remains the same, and if `c` is 1, the count of ones in `cnt` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
