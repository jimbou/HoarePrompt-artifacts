Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains n-1 lines, each containing a binary string s (2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5), _ is 0, s is a list of integers representing a binary string, zeroes is the count of zeroes in s, cnt is a list of two integers both equal to 0, ans is 0
Code of the loop:
for c in s:
    cnt[c] += 1
    if c == 0:
        ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
    else:
        ans += zeroes - cnt[0]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains n-1 lines, each containing a binary string s (2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5), _ is 0, s is a list of integers representing a binary string that is not empty, zeroes is the count of zeroes in s, cnt is a list of two integers where cnt[c] is increased by 1 and cnt[1-c] is 0, if the first element c in s is 0, then ans is 1 if cnt[1] > 0, otherwise ans is 0. If the first element c in s is 1, then ans is zeroes - cnt[0].

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains n-1 lines, each containing a binary string s (2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5), _ is 0, s is a list of integers representing a binary string that has at least 2 elements, c is the second element in the list s, zeroes is the count of zeroes in s, cnt is a list of two integers where cnt[c] is increased by 1 and cnt[1-c] is 0. If the first element c in s is 0, then ans is increased by 1 if cnt[1] > 0, otherwise ans remains the same. If the first element c in s is 1, then ans is zeroes - cnt[0] + zeroes - cnt[0].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains n-1 lines, each containing a binary string s (2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5), _ is 0, s is a list of integers representing a binary string that has at least 3 elements, c is the third element in the list s, zeroes is the count of zeroes in s, cnt is a list of two integers where cnt[c] is increased by 1 and cnt[1-c] is 0. If the first element c in s is 0, then ans is increased by 1 if cnt[1] > 0, otherwise ans remains the same. If the first element c in s is 1, then ans is zeroes - cnt[0] + zeroes - cnt[0].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
