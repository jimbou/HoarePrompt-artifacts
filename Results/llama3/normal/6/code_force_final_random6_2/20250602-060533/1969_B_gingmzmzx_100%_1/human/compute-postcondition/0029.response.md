Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `s` is a list of integers representing the binary string from the last line of stdin that must have at least 1 integer, `c` is the first integer in the list `s` and is not equal to 0, `zeroes` is the count of zeroes in the last binary string `s`, `cnt` is a list of two integers where `cnt[0]` is the count of zeroes in the last binary string `s` and `cnt[1]` is the count of ones in the last binary string `s` incremented by 1 if `c` is 1, `ans` is 0, and `stdin` is empty***
