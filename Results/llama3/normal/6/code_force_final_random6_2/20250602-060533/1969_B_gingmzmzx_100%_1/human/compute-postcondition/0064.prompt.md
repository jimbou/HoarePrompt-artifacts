Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 2, s is a list of integers, zeroes is the count of zeroes in the list s, cnt is a list of two integers where cnt[0] is the count of zeroes in the list s and cnt[1] is the count of ones in the list s, ans is 0, and stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
for c in s:
    cnt[c] += 1
    if c == 0:
        ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
    else:
        ans += zeroes - cnt[0]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `c` is the first integer in the list `s`, `zeroes` is the count of zeroes in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list of two integers where `cnt[0]` is either `zeroes` or `zeroes + 1` and `cnt[1]` is either `cnt[1]` or `cnt[1] + 1`, and `ans` is either 0, 1 or -1 depending on whether `c` is 0, `cnt[1]` is greater than 0 or `c` is not equal to 0 respectively, and stdin is empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `c` is the second integer in the list `s`, `zeroes` is the count of zeroes in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list of two integers where `cnt[0]` is either `zeroes` or `zeroes + 1` and `cnt[1]` is either `cnt[1]` or `cnt[1] + 1` and is now increased by 1 at the index c, and `ans` is either 1 or 0 or -1 depending on whether `c` is 0, `cnt[1]` is greater than 0 or `c` is not equal to 0 respectively, and stdin is empty. If `c` is 0, `ans` is either 1 or 0 or -1 depending on whether `c` is 0, `cnt[1]` is greater than 0 or `c` is not equal to 0 respectively. If `c` is not 0, `ans` is either `zeroes - cnt[0]`, `zeroes - cnt[0] + 1` or `zeroes - cnt[0] -1` depending on whether `c` is 0, `cnt[1]` is greater than 0 or `c` is not equal to 0 respectively.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `c` is the third integer in the list `s`, `zeroes` is the count of zeroes in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list of two integers where `cnt[0]` is either `zeroes` or `zeroes + 1` and `cnt[1]` is either `cnt[1]` or `cnt[1] + 1` and is now increased by 1 at the index c, and `ans` is either 2 or 1 + zeroes - cnt[0] or 0 + zeroes - cnt[0] or -1 + zeroes - cnt[0] depending on whether `c` is 0, `cnt[1]` is greater than 0 or `c` is not equal to 0 respectively, and stdin is empty.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
