The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `s` is an empty list, `c` is the last integer in the list `s`, `zeroes` is the count of zeroes in the last binary string `s`, `cnt` is a list of two integers where `cnt[0]` is the count of zeroes in the last binary string `s` and `cnt[1]` is the count of ones in the last binary string `s`, and `ans` is the total count of zeroes in the last binary string `s` that are followed by at least one one, and `stdin` is empty, and the total count of zeroes in the last binary string `s` that are followed by at least one one which is `ans` is being printed**
