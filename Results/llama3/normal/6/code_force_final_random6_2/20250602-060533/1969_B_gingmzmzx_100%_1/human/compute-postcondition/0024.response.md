Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 1, s is a list of integers representing the binary string from the last line of stdin, zeroes is the count of zeroes in the last binary string s, cnt is a list of two integers where cnt[0] is the count of zeroes in the last binary string s and cnt[1] is the count of ones in the last binary string s, ans is 0, and stdin is empty.**

Explanation:
The code reads the last binary string from stdin and converts it into a list of integers, which is assigned to `s`. It then counts the number of zeroes in this binary string and assigns it to `zeroes`. The `cnt` list is initialized with two elements, both set to 0, where `cnt[0]` will hold the count of zeroes and `cnt[1]` will hold the count of ones in the last binary string `s`. The `ans` variable is initialized to 0. After executing this code block, stdin is empty because all input lines have been read.
