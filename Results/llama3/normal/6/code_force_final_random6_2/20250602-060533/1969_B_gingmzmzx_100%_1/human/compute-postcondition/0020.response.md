Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains n-1 lines, each containing a binary string s (2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5), _ is 0, s is an empty list of integers, zeroes is the count of zeroes in the original s, cnt is a list of two integers where cnt[0] is the count of zeroes in the original s and cnt[1] is the count of ones in the original s, ans is the sum of the counts of zeroes in the original s that are to the right of each one in the original s.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will have the same values for `n`, stdin, and `_` as in the initial state. The list `s` will be empty since all its elements have been processed. The variable `zeroes` will still hold the count of zeroes in the original binary string `s`. The list `cnt` will hold the total count of zeroes and ones in the original binary string `s`. The variable `ans` will hold the sum of the counts of zeroes that are to the right of each one in the original binary string `s`.
