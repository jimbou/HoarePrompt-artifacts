Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `c` is the first integer in the list `s` and its current value is 0, `zeroes` is the count of zeroes in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list of two integers where `cnt[0]` is either `zeroes` or `zeroes + 1` and `cnt[1]` is either `cnt[1]` or `cnt[1] + 1`, `ans` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `cnt[1]` is greater than 0 or not, and stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is updated based on the value of `cnt[1]`. If `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, `ans` becomes 1; otherwise, it remains 0. All other variables retain their original values and properties.
