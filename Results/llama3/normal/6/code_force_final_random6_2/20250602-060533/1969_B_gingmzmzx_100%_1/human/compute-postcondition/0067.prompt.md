Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `n` lines, each containing a binary string `s` (2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
    zeroes = s.count(0)
    cnt = [0, 0]
    ans = 0
    for c in s:
        cnt[c] += 1
        if c == 0:
            ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
        else:
            ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains n-1 lines, each containing a binary string s (2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5), _ is 0, s is an empty list of integers, zeroes is the count of zeroes in the original s, cnt is a list of two integers where cnt[0] is the count of zeroes in the original s and cnt[1] is the count of ones in the original s, ans is the sum of the counts of zeroes in the original s that are to the right of each one in the original s, and the sum of the counts of zeroes in the original s that are to the right of each one in the original s is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `s` is an empty list, `c` is the last integer in the list `s`, `zeroes` is the count of zeroes in the last binary string `s`, `cnt` is a list of two integers where `cnt[0]` is the count of zeroes in the last binary string `s` and `cnt[1]` is the count of ones in the last binary string `s`, and `ans` is the total count of zeroes in the last binary string `s` that are followed by at least one one, and `stdin` is empty, and the total count of zeroes in the last binary string `s` that are followed by at least one one which is `ans` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 2, s is an empty list, c is the last integer in the list s, zeroes is the count of zeroes in the list s, cnt is a list of two integers where cnt[0] is the count of zeroes in the list s and cnt[1] is the count of ones in the list s, ans is the sum of the counts of ones in the list s and the count of zeroes in the list s minus the count of zeroes in the list s, and stdin is empty, and ans is printed which is equal to the sum of the counts of ones in the list s and the count of zeroes in the list s minus the count of zeroes in the list s




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
