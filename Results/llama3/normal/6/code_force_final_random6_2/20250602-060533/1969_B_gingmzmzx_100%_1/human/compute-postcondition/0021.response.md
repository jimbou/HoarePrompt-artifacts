The `print(ans)` statement will print the sum of the counts of zeroes in the original binary string `s` that are to the right of each one in the original `s`.

Since the exact binary string `s` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated sum of the counts of zeroes to the right of each one in the original binary string `s`.

Output: **sum of the counts of zeroes in the original binary string s that are to the right of each one in the original s**
