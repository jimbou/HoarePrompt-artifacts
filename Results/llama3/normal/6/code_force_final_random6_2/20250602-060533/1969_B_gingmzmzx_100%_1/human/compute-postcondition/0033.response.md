Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `s` is a list of integers representing the binary string from the last line of stdin that must have at least 2 integers, `c` is the second integer in the list `s`, `zeroes` is the count of zeroes in the last binary string `s`, `cnt` is a list of two integers where `cnt[0]` is the count of zeroes in the last binary string `s` and `cnt[1]` is the count of ones in the last binary string `s` incremented by 1 if `c` is 1, `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1, `ans` is 1 if `c` is 0 and `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, otherwise `ans` is 0 if `c` is 0, and `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0]` if `c` is not 0, and `stdin` is empty**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt[c]` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `cnt[c]` is now one more than its previous value. The rest of the variables maintain their previous values and properties.
