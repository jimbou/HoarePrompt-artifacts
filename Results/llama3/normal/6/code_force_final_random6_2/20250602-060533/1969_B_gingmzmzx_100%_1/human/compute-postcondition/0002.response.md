The code reads a binary string from the input, counts the number of zeroes in the string, and initializes two counters and a variable to zero. After executing the code, the input state is reduced by one line, and the variables are updated as follows:

*   `s` is a list of integers representing the binary string read from the input.
*   `zeroes` is the count of zeroes in the binary string `s`.
*   `cnt` is a list of two integers, both initialized to zero.
*   `ans` is an integer initialized to zero.

Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains n-1 lines, each containing a binary string s (2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5), _ is 0, s is a list of integers representing a binary string, zeroes is the count of zeroes in s, cnt is a list of two integers both equal to 0, ans is 0**
