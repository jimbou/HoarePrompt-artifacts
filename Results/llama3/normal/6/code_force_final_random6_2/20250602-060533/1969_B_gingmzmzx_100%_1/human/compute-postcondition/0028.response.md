Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `s` is a list of integers representing the binary string from the last line of stdin that must have at least 1 integer, `c` is the first integer in the list `s` and its current value is 0, `zeroes` is the count of zeroes in the last binary string `s`, `cnt` is a list of two integers where `cnt[0]` is the count of zeroes in the last binary string `s` and `cnt[1]` is the count of ones in the last binary string `s`, `ans` is 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, otherwise `ans` is 0, and `stdin` is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated based on the count of ones in the last binary string `s`. If there is at least one '1' in the binary string, `ans` is now 1; otherwise, it remains 0. All other variables retain their original values, and the stdin remains empty.
