The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again `_` must be 1 and `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive).
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains n-1 lines, each containing a binary string s (2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5), _ is 1, s is an empty list of integers, zeroes is the count of zeroes in the original s, cnt is a list of two integers where cnt[0] is the count of zeroes in the original s and cnt[1] is the count of ones in the original s, ans is the sum of the counts of zeroes in the original s that are to the right of each one in the original s, and the sum of the counts of zeroes in the original s that are to the right of each one in the original s is printed**
