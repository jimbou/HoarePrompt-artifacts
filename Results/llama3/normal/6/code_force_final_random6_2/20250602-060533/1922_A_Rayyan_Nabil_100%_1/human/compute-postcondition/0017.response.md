Output State: **`t` is equal to the length of `results`, `n` is a positive integer equal to its original value plus the integer value of the input, `a`, `b`, `c` are strings consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `results` is a list containing `t` elements: each element is the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` with the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `c` at each iteration, `stdin` is empty, `_` is `t-1`, and all elements in `results` have been printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that the variable `t` is now equal to the total number of elements in the `results` list. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, as they are not modified within the loop. The `results` list still contains the return values of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration, but now all elements in this list have been printed. The `stdin` remains empty, and the variable `_` is one less than the total number of iterations (`t-1`).
