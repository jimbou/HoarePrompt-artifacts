The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `t` is t-1. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again t must be greater than 1.
State: **t is t-1, n is a positive integer equal to its original value plus the integer value of the input, a, b, c are strings consisting of n lowercase Latin letters, results is a list containing two elements: the first element is the return value of func_1(n, a, b, c) with the original values of n, a, b, c, and the second element is the return value of func_1(n, a, b, c) with the new values of n, a, b, c, stdin contains t-8 inputs: each input is a string consisting of n lowercase Latin letters, _ is 2**
