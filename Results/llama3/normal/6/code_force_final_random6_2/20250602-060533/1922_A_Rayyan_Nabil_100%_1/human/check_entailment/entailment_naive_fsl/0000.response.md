Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` checks for each character position in the strings `a`, `b`, and `c` whether `a` and `b` have different characters than `c`. If it finds such a position, it immediately returns 'YES', indicating that a template `t` exists that matches `a` and `b` but not `c`. If it doesn't find any such position after checking all characters, it returns 'NO', indicating that no such template exists.

The main function `func_2` reads the input, calls `func_1` for each test case, and prints the results. It correctly handles the input format and the number of test cases.

The program's logic is sound, and it covers all possible cases. It doesn't miss any edge cases or potential inputs that could cause it to produce incorrect results. Therefore, the program is correct, and the answer is 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, as required by the problem statement.
