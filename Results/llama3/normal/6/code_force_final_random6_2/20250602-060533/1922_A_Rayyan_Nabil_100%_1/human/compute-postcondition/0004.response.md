Output State: **t is t-1, n is a positive integer equal to its original value plus the integer value of the input, a, b, c are strings consisting of n lowercase Latin letters, results is a list containing two elements: the first element is the return value of func_1(n, a, b, c) with the original values of n, a, b, c, and the second element is the return value of func_1(n, a, b, c) with the new values of n, a, b, c, stdin contains t-8 inputs: each input is a string consisting of n lowercase Latin letters, _ is 1**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to the integer value of the input, which is a positive integer. The strings `a`, `b`, and `c` have been updated to the new values read from the input. The `results` list now contains two elements: the first element is the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` with the original values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, and the second element is the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` with the new values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`. The `stdin` now contains `t-8` inputs, each of which is a string consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 1.
