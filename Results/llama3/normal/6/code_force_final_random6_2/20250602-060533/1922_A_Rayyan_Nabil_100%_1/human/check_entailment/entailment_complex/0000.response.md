Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. The given Python program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2.

func_1 compares three strings of equal length, 'a', 'b', and 'c', and returns 'YES' if there exists at least one position where both 'a' and 'b' differ from 'c', otherwise it returns 'NO'. This function correctly implements the condition for the strings a and b to match the template t, while the string c does not.

func_2 reads input from the user, processes it, and prints the results. It accepts a positive integer t and t sets of input, each consisting of a positive integer n and three strings a, b, and c of length n. The function calls func_1 with these inputs and stores the results in a list. After processing all inputs, the function prints each result in the list.

The program correctly implements the problem description. The main function, func_2, reads the input, calls func_1 to process each test case, and prints the results. func_1 correctly checks if there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not.

Correctness: **True**
