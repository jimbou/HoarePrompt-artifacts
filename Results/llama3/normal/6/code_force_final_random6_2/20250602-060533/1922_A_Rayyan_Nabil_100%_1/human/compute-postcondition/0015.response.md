The `print(result)` statement will print the third element in the `results` list.
Since the exact values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `c` at each iteration are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `result`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` at the third iteration.
Output: **the return value of func_1(n, a, b, c) at the third iteration (where n, a, b, c are the values at the third iteration)**
