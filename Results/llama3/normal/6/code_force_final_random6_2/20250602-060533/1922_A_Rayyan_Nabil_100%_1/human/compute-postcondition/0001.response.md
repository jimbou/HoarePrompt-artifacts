The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer, `n` is a positive integer, `a`, `b`, `c` are strings consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `results` is an empty list, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs: each input is a string consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters. So for the loop to be executed  `t` must be greater than 0 and `_` is 0.
State: **`t` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer, `a`, `b`, `c` are strings consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `results` is an empty list, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs: each input is a string consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `_` is 0**
