The `print(result)` statement will print the second element in the `results` list. The `results` list contains return values of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` at each iteration. Since the exact values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `c` and the implementation of `func_1` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `result`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the second return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`.

Output: **the second return value of func_1(n, a, b, c) (where n is a positive integer equal to its original value plus the integer value of the input, a, b, c are strings consisting of n lowercase Latin letters)**
