The only variable in the loop head is variable `result`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results`. If `results` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `results` has at least 1 element, `result` is the first element in `results`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the `results` must have at least 2 elements and the `result` is the second element in the `results`.
State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is a positive integer equal to its original value plus the integer value of the input, `a`, `b`, `c` are strings consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `results` is a list containing at least 2 elements: each element is the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` with the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `c` at each iteration, `stdin` is empty, `_` is `t-1`, `result` is the second element in `results`**
