Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer, n is a positive integer, a, b, c are strings consisting of n lowercase Latin letters, results is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 inputs: each input is a string consisting of n lowercase Latin letters.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input().strip())
    a = input().strip()
    b = input().strip()
    c = input().strip()
    results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer that must be greater than 0, n is a positive integer, a, b, c are strings consisting of n lowercase Latin letters, results is a list containing one element which is the return value of func_1(n, a, b, c), stdin contains t-4 inputs: each input is a string consisting of n lowercase Latin letters, _ is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is t-1, n is a positive integer equal to its original value plus the integer value of the input, a, b, c are strings consisting of n lowercase Latin letters, results is a list containing two elements: the first element is the return value of func_1(n, a, b, c) with the original values of n, a, b, c, and the second element is the return value of func_1(n, a, b, c) with the new values of n, a, b, c, stdin contains t-8 inputs: each input is a string consisting of n lowercase Latin letters, _ is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is t-1, n is a positive integer equal to its original value plus the integer value of the input, a is a string consisting of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string consisting of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string consisting of n lowercase Latin letters, results is a list containing three elements: the first element is the return value of func_1(n, a, b, c) with the original values of n, a, b, c, the second element is the return value of func_1(n, a, b, c) with the new values of n, a, b, c, and the third element is the return value of func_1(n, a, b, c) with the new values of n, a, b, c, stdin contains t-5 inputs: each input is a string consisting of n lowercase Latin letters, _ is 2




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
