Functionality: **The function reads input from the user, processes it, and prints the results. It accepts a positive integer `t` and `t` sets of input, each consisting of a positive integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n`. The function calls another function `func_1` with these inputs and stores the results in a list. After processing all inputs, the function prints each result in the list. The final state of the program is that all input has been processed, the results have been printed, and the input buffer is empty.**
