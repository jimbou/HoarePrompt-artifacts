To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for result in results:`, which means we can only adjust the state of `result` and `results`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `result` is the second element in `results`, and it is being printed. This means that the loop has already processed the first two elements in `results`.

For the loop to execute again, `results` must have at least three elements. Therefore, we can adjust the state of `results` to have at least three elements.

The state of `result` can be adjusted to be the third element in `results`, since the loop will process the next element in the list.

The other variables in the state (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `stdin`, `_`) are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is a positive integer equal to its original value plus the integer value of the input, `a`, `b`, `c` are strings consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `results` is a list containing at least 3 elements: each element is the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` with the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `c` at each iteration, `stdin` is empty, `_` is `t-1`, `result` is the third element in `results`**
