Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine whether there exists a template `t` such that the strings `a` and `b` match it, while the string `c` does not. The program uses a simple iterative approach to check if there exists an index `i` such that `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`. If such an index exists, the program returns 'YES', indicating that a template `t` exists. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates over the characters of the strings `a`, `b`, and `c` and checks the conditions specified in the problem statement. If the conditions are met, it returns 'YES', and if not, it returns 'NO'.

The program also correctly handles the input and output. It reads the number of test cases `t`, the length of the strings `n`, and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. It then calls the function `func_1` with the correct arguments and appends the result to the list `results`. Finally, it prints the results.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
