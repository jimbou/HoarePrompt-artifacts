Output State: **t is t-1, n is a positive integer equal to its original value plus the integer value of the input, a is a string consisting of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string consisting of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string consisting of n lowercase Latin letters, results is a list containing three elements: the first element is the return value of func_1(n, a, b, c) with the original values of n, a, b, c, the second element is the return value of func_1(n, a, b, c) with the new values of n, a, b, c, and the third element is the return value of func_1(n, a, b, c) with the new values of n, a, b, c, stdin contains t-5 inputs: each input is a string consisting of n lowercase Latin letters, _ is 2**

The code block reads an integer value from stdin and assigns it to `n`, making `n` a positive integer equal to its original value plus the integer value of the input. It then reads three strings from stdin, each consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters, and assigns them to `a`, `b`, and `c`, respectively. The code then appends the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` with the new values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` to the `results` list. The `results` list now contains three elements: the first element is the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` with the original values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, the second element is the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` with the new values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, and the third element is the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` with the new values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`. The stdin now contains `t-5` inputs: each input is a string consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 2.
