Output State: **t is 0, n is a positive integer equal to its original value plus the integer value of the input, a, b, c are strings consisting of n lowercase Latin letters, results is a list containing t elements: each element is the return value of func_1(n, a, b, c) with the values of n, a, b, c at each iteration, stdin is empty, _ is t-1**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be 0, indicating that the loop has finished. The variable `n` will have increased by the integer value of the input at each iteration, and `a`, `b`, and `c` will be strings of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The `results` list will contain `t` elements, each of which is the return value of the `func_1` function called with the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` at each iteration. The `stdin` will be empty, indicating that all inputs have been consumed, and the loop variable `_` will be `t-1`, which is the last iteration number.
