Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

Example

Input

    1
    
    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb
    
    aa

    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

# Annotated Functions:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, a, b, and c are strings of length n, consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
            return 'YES'
        
    #State: n is a positive integer, a, b, and c are strings of length n, consisting of lowercase Latin letters, i is n. If there exists an index j such that a[j] is not equal to c[j] and b[j] is not equal to c[j], the program returns the string 'YES'. Otherwise, no action is taken.
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns the string 'NO'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function compares three strings of equal length, 'a', 'b', and 'c', and returns 'YES' if there exists at least one position where both 'a' and 'b' differ from 'c', otherwise it returns 'NO'.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer, a, b, c are strings consisting of n lowercase Latin letters.
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        
        a = input().strip()
        
        b = input().strip()
        
        c = input().strip()
        
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
        
    #State: t is 0, n is a positive integer equal to its original value plus the integer value of the input, a, b, c are strings consisting of n lowercase Latin letters, results is a list containing t elements: each element is the return value of func_1(n, a, b, c) with the values of n, a, b, c at each iteration, stdin is empty, _ is t-1
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `t` is equal to the length of `results`, `n` is a positive integer equal to its original value plus the integer value of the input, `a`, `b`, `c` are strings consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `results` is a list containing `t` elements: each element is the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` with the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `c` at each iteration, `stdin` is empty, `_` is `t-1`, and all elements in `results` have been printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from the user, processes it, and prints the results. It accepts a positive integer `t` and `t` sets of input, each consisting of a positive integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n`. The function calls another function `func_1` with these inputs and stores the results in a list. After processing all inputs, the function prints each result in the list. The final state of the program is that all input has been processed, the results have been printed, and the input buffer is empty.
