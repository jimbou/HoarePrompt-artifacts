To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `result` and `results`. The loop will execute if `results` has at least one element. Since `results` is a list containing `t` elements, we need to adjust `t` to be at least 1.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is a positive integer equal to its original value plus the integer value of the input, `a`, `b`, `c` are strings consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `results` is a list containing at least 1 element: each element is the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` with the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `c` at each iteration, `stdin` is empty, `_` is `t-1`, `result` is the first element in `results`**
