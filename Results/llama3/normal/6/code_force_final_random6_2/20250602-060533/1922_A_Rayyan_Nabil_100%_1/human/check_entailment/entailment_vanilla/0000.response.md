Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. The given program uses two functions: func_1 and func_2.

func_1 takes four parameters: n (the length of the strings), and the strings a, b, and c. It iterates over the characters of the strings and checks if there exists a position i where a[i] is not equal to c[i] and b[i] is not equal to c[i]. If such a position is found, it returns 'YES', indicating that a template t exists. If no such position is found after iterating over all characters, it returns 'NO'.

func_2 reads the number of test cases t, then for each test case, it reads the length of the strings n and the strings a, b, and c. It calls func_1 with these parameters and appends the result to the results list. Finally, it prints each result.

The given program is correct because it accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. It checks for the existence of a position where a and b differ from c, which is a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a template t that matches a and b but not c.

Correctness: **True**
