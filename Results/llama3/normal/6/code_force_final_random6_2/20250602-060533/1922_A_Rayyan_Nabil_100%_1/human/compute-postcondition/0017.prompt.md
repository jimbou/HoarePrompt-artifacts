Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is 0, n is a positive integer equal to its original value plus the integer value of the input, a, b, c are strings consisting of n lowercase Latin letters, results is a list containing t elements: each element is the return value of func_1(n, a, b, c) with the values of n, a, b, c at each iteration, stdin is empty, _ is t-1
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is at least 1, `n` is a positive integer equal to its original value plus the integer value of the input, `a`, `b`, `c` are strings consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `results` is a list containing at least 1 element: each element is the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` with the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `c` at each iteration, `stdin` is empty, `_` is `t-1`, `result` is the first element in `results`, and the first element in `results` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is at least 1, `n` is a positive integer equal to its original value plus the integer value of the input, `a`, `b`, `c` are strings consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `results` is a list containing at least 2 elements: each element is the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` with the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `c` at each iteration, `stdin` is empty, `_` is `t-1`, `result` is the second element in `results`, and the second element in `results` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is at least 1, `n` is a positive integer equal to its original value plus the integer value of the input, `a`, `b`, `c` are strings consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `results` is a list containing at least 3 elements: each element is the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` with the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `c` at each iteration, `stdin` is empty, `_` is `t-1`, `result` is the third element in `results`, and the third element in the results list which is the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` with the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `c` at the third iteration is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
