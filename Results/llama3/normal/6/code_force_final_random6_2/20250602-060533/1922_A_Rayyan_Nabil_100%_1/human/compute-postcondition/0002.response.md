Output State: **t is an integer that must be greater than 0, n is a positive integer, a, b, c are strings consisting of n lowercase Latin letters, results is a list containing one element which is the return value of func_1(n, a, b, c), stdin contains t-4 inputs: each input is a string consisting of n lowercase Latin letters, _ is 0**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer, the value of `n` remains a positive integer. The second, third, and fourth lines assign the string values of the next three inputs to `a`, `b`, and `c`, respectively. Since `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain strings consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters. The fifth line appends the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` to the `results` list. Since `results` is an empty list, it now contains one element, which is the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`. The value of `_` remains 0. The value of `t` remains an integer that must be greater than 0. Stdin now contains `t-4` inputs, each of which is a string consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters.
