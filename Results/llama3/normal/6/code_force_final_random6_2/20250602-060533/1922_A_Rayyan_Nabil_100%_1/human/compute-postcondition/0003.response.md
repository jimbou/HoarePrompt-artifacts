To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `_` and `t`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `_` must be increased by 1, so `_` is 1. Also, `t` must be decreased by 1, so `t` is `t-1`. 

State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is a positive integer, `a`, `b`, `c` are strings consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `results` is a list containing one element which is the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`, `stdin` contains `t-5` inputs: each input is a string consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `_` is 1**
