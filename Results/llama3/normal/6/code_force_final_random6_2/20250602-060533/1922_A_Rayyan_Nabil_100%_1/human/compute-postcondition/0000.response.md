Output State: **t is an integer, n is a positive integer, a, b, c are strings consisting of n lowercase Latin letters, results is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 inputs: each input is a string consisting of n lowercase Latin letters.**

The first line of the code assigns the integer value of the input to `t`. Since `t` was a positive integer, it remains a positive integer. The second line initializes an empty list called `results`. No other variables are affected.
