Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. The program correctly handles the base case where n is 2, and for n greater than 2, it correctly checks the parity of the count of '1's in the binary string s and the presence of exactly one '11' substring. The program's logic is sound and it covers all possible cases.

Correctness: **True**
