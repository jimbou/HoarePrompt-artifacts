Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `s` is a binary string of size `n`, stdin contains 0 test cases less than the initial state. If `n` is equal to 2, then if `s` is equal to '00', 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is not equal to 2, then if count_1 is odd, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, if the binary string `s` contains exactly one occurrence of '11', then 'NO' is printed. In all other cases, 'YES' is printed.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been decremented by 1, so it is now an integer greater than or equal to 0. The values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged. The stdin now contains 0 test cases less than the initial state. The conditions for printing 'YES' or 'NO' remain the same as in the initial state.
