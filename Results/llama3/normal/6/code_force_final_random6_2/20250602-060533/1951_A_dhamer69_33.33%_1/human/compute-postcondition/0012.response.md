Output State: **`t` is an integer larger than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `s` is a binary string of size `n`, `count_1` is an integer between 0 and `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than the initial state, and `n` is not equal to 2**

In this output state, the value of `count_1` is assigned the number of occurrences of the character '1' in the binary string `s`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but 2 test cases less than the initial state. Additionally, the constraint that `n` is not equal to 2 is still valid.
