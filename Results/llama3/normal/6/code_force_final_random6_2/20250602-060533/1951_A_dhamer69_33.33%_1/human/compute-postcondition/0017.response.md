Postcondition: **`t` is an integer larger than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `s` is a binary string of size `n`, `count_1` is an integer between 0 and `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than the initial state, and `n` is not equal to 2, and `count_1` is even. The current value of `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11'.**
