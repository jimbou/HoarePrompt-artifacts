Output State: **t is an integer larger than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 50, s is a binary string of size n, stdin contains 2 test cases less than the initial state.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `n` is updated to a new integer value read from the input, which is between 1 and 50. The value of `s` is also updated to a new binary string of size `n`, read from the input. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 2, as two inputs are read by the code.
