The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t. If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, t is an integer larger than 0, so no other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`t` is an integer larger than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1 test case less than the initial state. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (1 <= n <= 50) and then a binary string of size n.**
