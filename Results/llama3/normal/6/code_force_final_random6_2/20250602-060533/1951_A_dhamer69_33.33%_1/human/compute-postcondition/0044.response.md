Output State: **t is an integer larger than -1, n is an integer between 1 and 50, s is a binary string of size n, stdin contains 2 test cases less than the initial state. If n is 2, then if s is equal to '00', 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If n is not 2, then if the count of 1s in s is odd, 'NO' is printed. If the count of 1s in s is even, then if the binary string s contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11', 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.**

In this output state, the value of t has been decremented by 1, so it is now an integer larger than -1. The values of n and s remain the same, as they were not affected by the code. The stdin still contains 2 test cases less than the initial state. The conditions for printing 'YES' or 'NO' based on the values of n and s also remain the same.
