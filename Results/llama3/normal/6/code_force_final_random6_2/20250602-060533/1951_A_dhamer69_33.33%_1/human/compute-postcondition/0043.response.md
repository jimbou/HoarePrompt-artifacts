Postcondition: ***t is an integer larger than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 50, s is a binary string of size n, stdin contains 2 test cases less than the initial state. If n is 2, then if s is equal to '00', 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If n is not 2, then if the count of 1s in s is odd, 'NO' is printed. If the count of 1s in s is even, then if the binary string s contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11', 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.***
