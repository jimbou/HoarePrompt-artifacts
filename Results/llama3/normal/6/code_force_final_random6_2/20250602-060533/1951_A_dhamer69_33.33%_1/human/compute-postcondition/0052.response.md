Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `s` is a binary string of size `n`, `count_1` is an integer between 0 and `n`, stdin contains 1 test case less than the initial state.**

In this output state, the value of `count_1` is the number of '1's in the binary string `s`, which can be any integer between 0 and `n` (inclusive), since `s` is a binary string of size `n`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains 1 test case less than the initial state.
