Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 50, s is a binary string of size n, stdin contains 1 test case less than the initial state.**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. So now stdin only contains one test case now. The second line assigns the binary string value of the input to `s`. The value of `t` is not affected.
