Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 50, s is a binary string of size n, stdin contains 1 test case less than the initial state. If n is equal to 2, then if s is equal to '00', 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If n is not equal to 2, then if count_1 is odd, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, if the binary string s contains exactly one occurrence of '11', then 'NO' is printed. In all other cases, 'YES' is printed.***
