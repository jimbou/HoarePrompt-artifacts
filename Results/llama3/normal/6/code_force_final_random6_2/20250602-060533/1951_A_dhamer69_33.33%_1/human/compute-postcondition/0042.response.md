Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer larger than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `s` is a binary string of size `n`, `count_1` is an integer between 0 and `n`, stdin contains 2 test cases less than the initial state. If `count_1` is odd, 'NO' is printed. If `count_1` is even, then if the binary string `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11', 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.***
