Output State: **t is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 50, s is a binary string of size n, stdin contains 0 test cases less than the initial state. If n is 2, then if s is equal to '00', 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If n is not 2, then if the count of 1s in s is odd, 'NO' is printed. If the count of 1s in s is even, then if the binary string s contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11', 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The variables `n` and `s` will still be within their respective ranges, but their values will be determined by the last test case processed. The standard input `stdin` will be empty, as all test cases will have been consumed by the loop. The output will depend on the values of `n` and `s` in the last test case, following the same logic as before.
