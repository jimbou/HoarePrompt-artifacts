Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer larger than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1 test case less than the initial state. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (1 <= n <= 50) and then a binary string of size n.
Code of the loop:
while t > 0:
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    if n == 2:
        if s == '00':
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        count_1 = s.count('1')
        if count_1 % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif s.count('11') == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
    t -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer larger than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 50, s is a binary string of size n, stdin contains multiple test cases - 3 test cases less than the initial state. If n equals 2, then if s equals '00', 'YES' is being printed. If s is not equal to '00', 'NO' is being printed. If n is not equal to 2, then if count_1 is odd, 'NO' is printed. If count_1 is even, then if the binary string s contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11', 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, if s contains either no occurrences of '11' or more than one occurrence of '11', then 'YES' is printed.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is an integer larger than -1, n is an integer between 1 and 50, s is a binary string of size n, stdin contains 2 test cases less than the initial state. If n is 2, then if s is equal to '00', 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If n is not 2, then if the count of 1s in s is odd, 'NO' is printed. If the count of 1s in s is even, then if the binary string s contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11', 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `s` is a binary string of size `n`, stdin contains 0 test cases less than the initial state. If `n` is equal to 2, then if `s` is equal to '00', 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is not equal to 2, then if count_1 is odd, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, if the binary string `s` contains exactly one occurrence of '11', then 'NO' is printed. In all other cases, 'YES' is printed.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
