Output State: **t is an integer larger than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 50, s is a binary string of size n, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 test cases less than the initial state.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `n` is now an integer between 1 and 50, as it is assigned the value of the first input from stdin, which is an integer between 1 and 50. The value of `s` is now a binary string of size `n`, as it is assigned the value of the second input from stdin, which is a binary string of size `n`. The number of test cases in stdin has decreased by 2, as two inputs have been read from stdin.
