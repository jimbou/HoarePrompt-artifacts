Output State: **`t` is an integer larger than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1 test case less than the initial state. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (1 <= n <= 50) and then a binary string of size n.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is assigned an integer larger than 0 from the input. The stdin now contains one test case less than the initial state. Each test case still contains two inputs: first an integer (1 <= n <= 50) and then a binary string of size n.
