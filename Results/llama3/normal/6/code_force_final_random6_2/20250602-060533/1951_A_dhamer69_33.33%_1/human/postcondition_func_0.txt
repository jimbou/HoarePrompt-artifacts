This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) and a binary string s of size n. It then checks the binary string s based on the value of n. If n is 2, it prints 'YES' if s is '00', otherwise it prints 'NO'. If n is not 2, it counts the number of '1's in s. If the count is odd, it prints 'NO'. If the count is even, it checks if s contains exactly one '11' substring. If it does, it prints 'NO', otherwise it prints 'YES'. The function continues this process until all test cases have been read from standard input.
