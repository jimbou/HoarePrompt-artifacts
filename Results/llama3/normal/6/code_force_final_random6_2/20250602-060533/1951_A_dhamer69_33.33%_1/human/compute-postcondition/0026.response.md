Output State: **t is an integer larger than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 50, s is a binary string of size n, stdin contains multiple test cases - 3 test cases less than the initial state. If n equals 2, then if s equals '00', 'YES' is being printed. If s is not equal to '00', 'NO' is being printed. If n is not equal to 2, then if count_1 is odd, 'NO' is printed. If count_1 is even, then if the binary string s contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11', 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, if s contains either no occurrences of '11' or more than one occurrence of '11', then 'YES' is printed.**

The value of t is decremented by 1, so it can be 0 or more. The values of the other variables are not affected. The number of test cases in stdin is also decremented by 1.
