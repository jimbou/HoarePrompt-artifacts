Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 32 (inclusive), stdin contains t-3 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, q is 2, s is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. If the first character of the string s, i, is 'A', then ac is the number of 'A's in the string s plus 1, and bc is the number of 'B's in the string s. Otherwise, ac is the number of 'A's in the string s, and bc is the number of 'B's in the string s plus 1.***
