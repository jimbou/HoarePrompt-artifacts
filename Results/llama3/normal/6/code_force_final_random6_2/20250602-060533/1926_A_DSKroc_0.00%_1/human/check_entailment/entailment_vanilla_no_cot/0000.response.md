Correctness: **False** 

The issue with the given program is that the if-else statement that prints the most frequent character is outside the for loop that iterates over the test cases. This means that it will only print the result for the last test case, and not for each test case separately.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        if ac > bc:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')

func()
```

In this corrected version, the if-else statement is inside the for loop that iterates over the test cases, so it will print the result for each test case separately.
