Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 32 (inclusive). The stdin still contains `t` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, as the input operation only consumed the first integer value.
