Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32 (inclusive), stdin contains `t-1` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `q` is 0, `ac` is 0, `bc` is 1, `s` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B that must have at least 1 character, `i` is the first character in the string `s` and `i` is not 'A'**

The code increments the value of `bc` by 1, so its new value is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-1` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. The string `s` still has at least 1 character and its first character `i` is not 'A'.
