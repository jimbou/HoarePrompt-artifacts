Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32 (inclusive), stdin contains t-3 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `q` is 2, `s` is a string of length 4 consisting of letters A and B. If the first character of the string `s`, `i`, is 'A', then `ac` is the number of 'A's in the string `s` plus 2, and `bc` is the number of 'B's in the string `s`. Otherwise, `ac` is the number of 'A's in the string `s` plus 1, and `bc` is the number of 'B's in the string `s` plus 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ac` has been incremented by 1, while the values of other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `ac` and `bc` based on the first character of string `s` are still applicable, but with the updated value of `ac`.
