Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32 (inclusive), stdin contains `t-2` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `q` is 1, `ac` is 1, `bc` is 0, `s` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B that must have at least 1 character, and the first character `i` of the string `s` is 'A'.**

The value of `ac` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains `t-2` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. The string `s` still has at least 1 character and its first character `i` is still 'A'.
