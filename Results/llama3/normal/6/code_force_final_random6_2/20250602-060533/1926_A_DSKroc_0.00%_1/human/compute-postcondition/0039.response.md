Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 32 (inclusive), stdin contains t-3 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, q is 2, ac is the number of 'A's in the string s plus 1, bc is the number of 'B's in the string s, s is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, and the first character of the string s, i, is 'A'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ac` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ac` now represents the total number of 'A's in the string `s` plus 1. All other conditions and values remain the same as in the initial state.
