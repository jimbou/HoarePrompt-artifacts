Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the number of 'A's and 'B's in the string are equal. In this case, the program will always print 'B', whereas the problem description does not specify what to do in this case. The program should either print 'A' or 'B' or handle this case separately. 

For example, if the input string is "ABABA", the program will print 'B', but it should either print 'A' or handle this case separately.
