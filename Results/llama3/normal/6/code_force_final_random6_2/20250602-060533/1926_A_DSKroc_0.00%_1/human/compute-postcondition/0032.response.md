Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-2` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `q` is 1, `s` is a string of length 4 consisting of letters A and B, `i` is the third character of the original string `s`, `bc` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `bc` has been incremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-2` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, and the values of `t`, `q`, `s`, and `i` are the same as in the initial state.
