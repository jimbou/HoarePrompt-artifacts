Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 32 (inclusive), stdin contains `t-1` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `q` is 0, `s` is a string of length 4 consisting of letters A and B that must have at least 1 characters. If the first character of `s` is 'A' and `i` is 'A', then `ac` is either 3 or 2 and `bc` is either 0 or 1. If the first character of `s` is 'B' and `i` is 'A', then `ac` is either 1 or 2 and `bc` is either 1 or 2. If the first character of `s` is 'A' and `i` is 'B', then `ac` is either 2 or 1 and `bc` is either 1 or 2. If the first character of `s` is 'B' and `i` is 'B', then `ac` is either 0 or 1 and `bc` is either 2 or 3.***
