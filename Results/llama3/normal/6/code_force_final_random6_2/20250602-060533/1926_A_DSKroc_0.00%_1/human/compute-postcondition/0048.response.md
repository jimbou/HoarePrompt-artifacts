Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 32 (inclusive), stdin contains t-3 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, q is 2, s is a string of length at least 3 consisting of letters A and B, i is the third character in the string s, ac is the number of 'A's in the string s plus 3 if the first character of the string s is 'A', and bc is the number of 'B's in the string s if the first character of the string s is 'A', ac is the number of 'A's in the string s plus 1, and bc is the number of 'B's in the string s plus 2 if the first character of the string s is 'B'.**

In this output state, the value of ac has been incremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for the values of ac and bc are still dependent on the first character of the string s.
