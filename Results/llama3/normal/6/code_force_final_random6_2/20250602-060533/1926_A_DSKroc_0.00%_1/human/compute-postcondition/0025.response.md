Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 32 (inclusive), stdin contains `t-2` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `q` is 1, `s` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B that must have at least 1 character. If the first character `i` of the string `s` is 'A', then `ac` is 1 and `bc` is 0. If the first character `i` of the string `s` is not 'A', then `ac` is 0 and `bc` is 1.***
