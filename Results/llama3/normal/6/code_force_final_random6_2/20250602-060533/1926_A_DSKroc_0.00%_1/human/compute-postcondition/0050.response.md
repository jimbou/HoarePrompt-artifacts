Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 32 (inclusive), stdin contains t-3 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, q is 2, s is a string of length at least 3 consisting of letters A and B, i is the third character in the string s. If i is 'A', ac is the number of 'A's in the string s plus 3 if the first character of the string s is 'A', and bc is the number of 'B's in the string s if the first character of the string s is 'A', ac is the number of 'A's in the string s plus 1, and bc is the number of 'B's in the string s plus 2 if the first character of the string s is 'B'. If i is 'B', ac is the number of 'A's in the string s plus 2 if the first character of the string s is 'A', and bc is the number of 'B's in the string s plus 1 if the first character of the string s is 'A', ac is the number of 'A's in the string s, and bc is the number of 'B's in the string s plus 3 if the first character of the string s is 'B'.**
