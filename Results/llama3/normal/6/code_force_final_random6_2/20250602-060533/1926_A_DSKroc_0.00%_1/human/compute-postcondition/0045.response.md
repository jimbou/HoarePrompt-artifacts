Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 32 (inclusive), stdin contains t-3 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, q is 2, s is a string of length 4 consisting of letters A and B. If the first character of the string s, i, is 'A', then ac is the number of 'A's in the string s plus 1, and bc is the number of 'B's in the string s plus 1. Otherwise, ac is the number of 'A's in the string s, and bc is the number of 'B's in the string s plus 2.**

In this output state, the value of bc has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of ac is still dependent on the first character of the string s, but the value of bc has been updated to be one more than its previous value.
