Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 32 (inclusive), stdin contains `t-1` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `q` is 0, `s` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B that must have at least 1 character, and the first character of `s`, `i`, determines the values of `ac` and `bc`: if `i` is 'A', then `ac` is 1 and `bc` is 0; otherwise, `ac` is 0 and `bc` is 1.***
