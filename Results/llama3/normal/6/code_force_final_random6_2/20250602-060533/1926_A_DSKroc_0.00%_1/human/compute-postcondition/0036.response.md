Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 32 (inclusive), stdin contains t-3 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, q is 2, ac is the number of 'A's in the string s, bc is the number of 'B's in the string s, s is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.**

The first line resets the value of `ac` to 0. The second line resets the value of `bc` to 0. The third line assigns a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B from stdin to `s`. Since `t` is an integer between 1 and 32 (inclusive), and `q` is 2, these values remain unchanged. The value of `ac` is now the number of 'A's in the string `s`, and the value of `bc` is now the number of 'B's in the string `s`. Stdin now contains `t-3` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.
