Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32 (inclusive), stdin contains t-3 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, q is 2, ac is the number of 'A's in the string s, bc is the number of 'B's in the string s plus 1, s is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, i is the first character in the string s, and i is not 'A'**

In this output state, the value of `bc` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The string `s` still has a length of 5 and consists of letters A and B, and the first character `i` is still not 'A'. The number of 'A's in the string `s` is still represented by `ac`, and the number of 'B's in the string `s` is now `bc + 1`. The value of `t` is still between 1 and 32 (inclusive), and the stdin still contains t-3 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. The value of `q` is still 2.
