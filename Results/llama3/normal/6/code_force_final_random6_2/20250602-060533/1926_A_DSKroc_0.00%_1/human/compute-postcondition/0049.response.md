Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 32 (inclusive), stdin contains t-3 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, q is 2, s is a string of length at least 3 consisting of letters A and B, i is the third character in the string s, ac is the number of 'A's in the string s plus 2 if the first character of the string s is 'A', and bc is the number of 'B's in the string s plus 1 if the first character of the string s is 'A', ac is the number of 'A's in the string s, and bc is the number of 'B's in the string s plus 3 if the first character of the string s is 'B'**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of bc has been incremented by 1. This means that if the first character of the string s is 'A', bc is now the number of 'B's in the string s plus 1, and if the first character of the string s is 'B', bc is now the number of 'B's in the string s plus 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
