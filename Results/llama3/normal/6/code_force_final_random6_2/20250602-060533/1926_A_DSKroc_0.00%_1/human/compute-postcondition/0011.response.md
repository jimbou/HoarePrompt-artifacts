Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32 (inclusive), stdin contains `t-1` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `q` is 0, `s` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B that must have at least 2 characters, `ac` is either 0 or 1, and `bc` is either 1 or 2 depending on the second character of `s`.**

In this output state, the value of `bc` has been incremented by 1, so it is now either 1 or 2 depending on the second character of `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.
