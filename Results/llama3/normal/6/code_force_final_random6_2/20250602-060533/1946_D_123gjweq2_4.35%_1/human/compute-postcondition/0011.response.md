Output State: **cur_arr is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, bit is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, x is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, bit is not equal to -1, xor is 0, new_arr is a list containing the bitwise XOR of its previous value and i.**

In this output state, the value of `xor` has been reset to 0, and a new list `new_arr` has been created containing the bitwise XOR of its previous value and `i`. The values of `cur_arr`, `bit`, and `x` remain unchanged.
