Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` calls `find_max` with the initial array and the most significant bit (31). The `find_max` function then recursively splits the array into subarrays based on the current bit being considered. If the current bit is 0 in the XOR of the subarray, it is added to the new array. If the current bit is 1 in the XOR of the subarray, the function returns -1, indicating that this subarray cannot be further split. The function then returns the maximum of the number of subarrays that can be formed by splitting the current array at the current bit and the number of subarrays that can be formed by recursively splitting the subarrays at the next bit.

The program correctly handles the case where the XOR of the entire array is greater than x, in which case it returns -1. It also correctly handles the case where the XOR of the entire array is less than or equal to x, in which case it returns the maximum number of subarrays that can be formed.

I have not been able to find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem statement work correctly. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
