Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 elements, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `bit` is not equal to -1. If the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 0, `xor` is reset to `xor` XOR `i` and `new_arr` is a list containing the bitwise XOR of its previous value and `i`. Otherwise, `xor` is reset to `xor` XOR `i`.**

In this output state, the value of `xor` has been updated to be the bitwise XOR of its previous value and `i`. The value of `new_arr` has also been updated if the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 0. The values of `cur_arr`, `bit`, and `x` remain unchanged.
