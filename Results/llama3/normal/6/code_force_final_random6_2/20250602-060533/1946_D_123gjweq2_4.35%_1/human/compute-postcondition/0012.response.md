Postcondition: ***`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `bit` is not equal to -1. If the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 0, `xor` is reset to 0 and `new_arr` is a list containing the bitwise XOR of its previous value and `i`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
