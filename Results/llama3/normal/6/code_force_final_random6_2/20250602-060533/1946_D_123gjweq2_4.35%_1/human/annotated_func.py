#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of non-negative integers `cur_arr` and an integer `bit` as input, and returns a value based on the bit manipulation of the integers in the list. If `bit` is -1, it returns the length of `cur_arr`. Otherwise, it performs a series of bit operations on the integers in `cur_arr` and returns either the maximum value in a new list `new_arr` that has a 0 at a specific bit position, the length of `new_arr`, or -1, depending on the bit value of an external non-negative integer `x` and the result of the bit operations.
