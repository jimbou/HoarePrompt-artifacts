Output State: **`cur_arr` is an empty list, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `bit` is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `xor` is 0, `thing1` is the maximum value in `new_arr` that has a 0 at position `bit - 1`, and the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `thing1` has been updated to the maximum value in `new_arr` that has a 0 at position `bit - 1`, as determined by the `find_max` function. The other variables remain unchanged.
