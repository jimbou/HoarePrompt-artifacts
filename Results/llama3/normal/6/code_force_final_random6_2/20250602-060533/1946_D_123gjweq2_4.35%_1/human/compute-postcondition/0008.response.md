Postcondition: ***`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `bit` is not equal to -1. If the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 0, then `new_arr` is a list containing the first element of `cur_arr`, `xor` is 0, `thing1` is 0, and `i` is the first element in the list `cur_arr`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
