Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem involving bitwise operations and array manipulation. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `find_max`.

`func_1` takes an array `arr` and an integer `k` as input and calls the `find_max` function with `arr` and `31` as arguments. The `find_max` function is not defined in the provided code, but based on its name and the context, it is likely that it finds the maximum value in the array `arr` that is less than or equal to `31`.

The `find_max` function is called recursively with a new array `new_arr` and a decremented `bit` value. The `new_arr` is constructed by iterating over the original array `cur_arr` and performing bitwise XOR operations. The `bit` value is used to determine the bit position to check in the XOR result.

The function returns the maximum value in `new_arr` that has a 0 at the specified bit position, the length of `new_arr`, or -1, depending on the bit value of an external non-negative integer `x` and the result of the bit operations.

The program's correctness can be evaluated by analyzing the logic and the expected output for the given problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
