Output State: **The program returns either -1 or the maximum value in `new_arr` that has a 0 at position `bit - 1`.**

In this output state, `thing1` is either -1 or the maximum value in `new_arr` that has a 0 at position `bit - 1`. This is because the bit at position `bit` in `x` is 0, and the value of `thing1` depends on the bit at position `bit` in `xor`. If the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 1, then `thing1` is -1. If the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 0, then `thing1` is the maximum value in `new_arr` that has a 0 at position `bit - 1`.
