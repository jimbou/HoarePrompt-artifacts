Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between the maximum value in the empty list `cur_arr` at position `bit - 1` (which is undefined since the list is empty) and the length of the list `new_arr` (which is a list of non-negative integers).**

Note: Since `cur_arr` is an empty list, `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)` will not return a meaningful value. Therefore, the program will return the length of `new_arr`, which is a non-negative integer.
