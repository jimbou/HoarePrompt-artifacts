Output State: **`cur_arr` is an empty list, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `bit` is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `xor` is 0, `thing1` is 0**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the list `cur_arr` will be empty because all its elements have been processed. The values of `bit` and `x` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. The list `new_arr` will contain the bitwise XOR of all elements in `cur_arr` that have a 0 at the bit position specified by `bit`. The variable `xor` will be reset to 0 after each iteration where the bit at position `bit` is 0, and `thing1` remains 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
