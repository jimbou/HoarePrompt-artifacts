Postcondition: ***`cur_arr` is an empty list, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `bit` is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `thing1` is 0. The current value of `xor` is a non-negative integer such that the bit at position `bit` is 1.***
