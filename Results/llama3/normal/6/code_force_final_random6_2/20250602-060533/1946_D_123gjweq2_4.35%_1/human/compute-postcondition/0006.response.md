Postcondition: ***`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `bit` is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is an empty list, `xor` is the first element in the list `cur_arr`, `thing1` is 0, `i` is the first element in the list. The current value of `xor` has a 0 at the bit position specified by `bit`***
