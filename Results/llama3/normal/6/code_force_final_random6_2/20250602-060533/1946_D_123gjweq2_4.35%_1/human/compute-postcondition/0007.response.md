Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `bit` is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is a list containing the first element of `cur_arr`, `xor` is 0, `thing1` is 0, `i` is the first element in the list `cur_arr`.**

In this final state, the value of `xor` has been reset to 0, and the first element of `cur_arr` has been appended to `new_arr`. All other variables remain unchanged.
