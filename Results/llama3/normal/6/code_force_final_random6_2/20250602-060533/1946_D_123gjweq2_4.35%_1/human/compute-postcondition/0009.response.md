The only object in the loop head is variable  `cur_arr`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cur_arr`.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `cur_arr` has at least 1 element, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `bit` is not equal to -1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements.
State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `bit` is not equal to -1**
