Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `bit` is not equal to -1, `xor` is the bitwise XOR of its previous value and `i`**.

In this output state, the value of `xor` has been updated to be the bitwise XOR of its previous value and `i`. The values of `cur_arr`, `bit`, and `x` remain unchanged, and the constraints on `bit` and `x` are still valid.
