Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `bit` is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is an empty list, `xor` is the first element in the list `cur_arr`, `thing1` is 0, `i` is the first element in the list**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `cur_arr` remains unchanged, `bit` and `x` still have their initial constraints, `new_arr` is still empty, `thing1` is still 0, and `i` is still the first element in the list. The only change is that `xor` is now equal to the first element in the list `cur_arr`, which is a non-negative integer.
