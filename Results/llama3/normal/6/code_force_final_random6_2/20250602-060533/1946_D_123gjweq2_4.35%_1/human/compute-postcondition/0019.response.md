Output State: **`cur_arr` is an empty list, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `bit` is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `thing1` is -1, The current value of `xor` is a non-negative integer such that the bit at position `bit` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables maintain their initial values except for `thing1`, which is now assigned the value -1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged, with `cur_arr` still being an empty list, `bit` and `x` retaining their respective ranges, `new_arr` staying as a list of non-negative integers, and `xor` keeping its bit at position `bit` as 1.
