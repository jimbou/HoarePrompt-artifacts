Postcondition: ***`cur_arr` is an empty list, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `bit` is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is a list of non-negative integers. The current value of `x` has a 1 at position `bit`. If the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 1, then `thing1` is -1. If the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 0, then `thing1` is the maximum value in `new_arr` that has a 0 at position `bit - 1`.***
