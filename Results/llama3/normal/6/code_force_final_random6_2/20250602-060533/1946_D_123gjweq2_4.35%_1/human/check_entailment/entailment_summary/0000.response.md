Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum number of segments in an array such that the bitwise XOR of each segment is less than or equal to a given number x. The segments must be non-overlapping and cover the entire array.

The provided code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `find_max`. `func_1` simply calls `find_max` with the input array and the number 31.

`find_max` is a recursive function that takes a list of non-negative integers `cur_arr` and an integer `bit` as input. It performs a series of bit operations on the integers in `cur_arr` and returns a value based on the result.

The key insight here is that the function `find_max` is not actually finding the maximum value in the array, but rather it is finding the maximum number of segments that can be created such that the bitwise XOR of each segment is less than or equal to x.

The function works by iterating over the array and performing a bitwise XOR operation on the elements. Whenever the XOR result has a 0 at the current bit position, it adds the XOR result to a new array and resets the XOR result. This effectively creates a new segment.

The function then recursively calls itself with the new array and the next bit position. If the bit position is -1, it returns the length of the array, which represents the maximum number of segments.

The function also checks the bit value of the external non-negative integer x and returns either the maximum value in the new array, the length of the new array, or -1, depending on the result.

Based on the execution summaries, it appears that the functions are working correctly. The `func_1` function is calling `find_max` with the correct inputs, and `find_max` is performing the correct bit operations and returning the correct values.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
