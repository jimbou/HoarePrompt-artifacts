Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem described, which involves performing a series of operations on an array and then answering queries about the elements of the array. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` takes as input a non-negative integer `n`, a list of operations, and a list of queries. It performs the operations on an array, which involves either appending a value to the array or duplicating the array. After all operations are performed, it uses the queries to extract elements from the array at specific indices, wrapping around to the start of the array if necessary. The function returns a list of the extracted elements.

`func_2` takes as input a positive integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of operations `n` and the number of queries `q`, as well as the operations and queries themselves. It then calls `func_1` with these inputs and prints the result.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. The operations are performed correctly, and the queries are answered correctly by wrapping around to the start of the array if necessary. The program also handles the input and output correctly, reading the necessary inputs and printing the results for each test case.

However, there is a logical error in the implementation of `func_1`. In the line `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])`, the array is duplicated, but the length of the array is not updated correctly. This will cause the function to produce incorrect results for queries that exceed the actual length of the array.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False** due to the logical error in `func_1`.
