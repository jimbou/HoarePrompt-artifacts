Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `operations` is an empty list, `queries` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 3 queries, `array` is a list of non-negative integers, `result` is a list containing the element at index `(k - 1) % len(array)` of `array` three times, `k` is the third query in the list**

In this output state, the value of `result` has been updated to include the element at index `(k - 1) % len(array)` of `array` three times. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `k` is still the third query in the list `queries`. The list `array` and the integer `n` retain their original values. The list `operations` is still empty.
