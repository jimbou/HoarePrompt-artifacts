Output State: **n is a non-negative integer, operations is an empty list, queries is a list of non-negative integers, array is a list of non-negative integers, result is an empty list.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable 'n' remains unchanged as a non-negative integer, the list 'operations' becomes empty as all operations have been executed, the list 'queries' remains unchanged as a list of non-negative integers, the list 'array' becomes a list of non-negative integers as a result of the operations, and the list 'result' remains empty as no results have been added to it.
