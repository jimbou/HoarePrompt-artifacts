Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first input integer, q is an integer equal to the second input integer, operations is a list of n lists, each containing two integers from stdin, queries is a list of integers from stdin, result is the output of func_1(n, operations, queries), t is equal to the initial value of t, stdin is empty, and the result of func_1(n, operations, queries) is printed t times.**

This output state means that after the loop executes all its iterations, the values of `n`, `q`, `operations`, and `queries` will be the same as the last iteration of the loop. The value of `t` will be equal to the initial value of `t`, indicating that the loop has executed all its iterations. The `stdin` will be empty, as all input values have been read and processed. The result of `func_1(n, operations, queries)` will be printed `t` times, where `t` is the number of iterations of the loop.
