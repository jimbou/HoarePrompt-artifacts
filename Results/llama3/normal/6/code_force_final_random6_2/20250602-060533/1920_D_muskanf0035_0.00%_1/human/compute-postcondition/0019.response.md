Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `operations` is an empty list, `queries` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 queries, `array` is a list of non-negative integers, `result` is a list containing the element at index `(k - 1) % len(array)` of `array` twice, `k` is the second query in the list**

In this output state, the value of `result` has been updated by appending the element at index `(k - 1) % len(array)` of `array` to the existing list. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `result` now contains two elements: the original element at index `(k - 1) % len(array)` of `array`, and the same element appended again.
