Output State: **n is a non-negative integer, operations is an empty list, queries is an empty list, array is a list of non-negative integers, result is a list containing the element at index (k - 1) % len(array) of array for each query k in the initial queries list.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the 'queries' list is empty, and the 'result' list contains the elements from the 'array' list that correspond to each query in the initial 'queries' list. The 'n' and 'operations' variables remain unchanged, and the 'array' list also remains the same.
