This function takes as input a positive integer n, a list of n lists of two integers (operations), and a list of integers (queries). It processes the operations and queries, and returns a result. The function is called t times, where t is an input integer, and the result is printed t times. The function does not modify the input variables n, operations, queries, or t. The purpose of the function is to perform some operation on the input data and return a result, which is then printed. The final state of the program is that the result of the function is printed t times, and the input variables remain unchanged.
