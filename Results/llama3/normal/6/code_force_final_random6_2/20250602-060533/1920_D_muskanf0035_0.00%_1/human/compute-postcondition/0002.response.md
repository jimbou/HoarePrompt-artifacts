Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first input integer, q is an integer equal to the second input integer, operations is a list of n lists, each containing two integers from stdin, queries is a list of integers from stdin, result is the output of func_1(n, operations, queries), t is at least 1, stdin is empty**

The code first reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to `n` and `q`, respectively. Then, it reads `n` lists of two integers each from stdin and assigns them to `operations`. After that, it reads a list of integers from stdin and assigns them to `queries`. Finally, it calls the function `func_1` with `n`, `operations`, and `queries` as arguments and assigns the result to `result`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and stdin is left empty after the execution of the code.
