To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `k` and the list `queries`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `queries`. If the list has at least 1 query, the loop will execute. Since `queries` is initially a list of non-negative integers, we need to ensure it has at least one element.

For the loop to execute, `k` should be the first query in the list. The other variables `n`, `operations`, `array`, and `result` are not directly related to the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `operations` is an empty list, `queries` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 query, `array` is a list of non-negative integers, `result` is an empty list, `k` is the first query in the list**
