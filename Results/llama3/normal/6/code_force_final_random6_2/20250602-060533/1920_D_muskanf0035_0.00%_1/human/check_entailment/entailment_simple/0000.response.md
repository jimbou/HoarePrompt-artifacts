Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. 

`func_1` takes three parameters: `n`, `operations`, and `queries`. It initializes an empty list `array` to store the elements of the array `a` and an empty list `result` to store the answers to Jayden's queries. It then iterates over the `operations` list. If the operation type is 1, it appends the value to the `array`. If the operation type is 2, it extends the `array` by appending a copy of itself. After processing all operations, it iterates over the `queries` list and appends the element at index `(k - 1) % len(array)` of `array` to the `result` list for each query `k`. Finally, it returns the `result` list.

`func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input, then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of operations `n` and the number of queries `q`, then reads the `operations` and `queries` lists from the input. It calls `func_1` with `n`, `operations`, and `queries` as arguments and prints the result.

However, there is a logical error in the program. In the `func_1` function, when the operation type is 2, the program extends the `array` by appending a copy of itself. This is incorrect because the problem statement specifies that Jayden appends `x` copies of the array `a` to the end of array `a`, not just one copy. Therefore, the program should extend the `array` by appending `x` copies of itself.

Correctness: **False**
