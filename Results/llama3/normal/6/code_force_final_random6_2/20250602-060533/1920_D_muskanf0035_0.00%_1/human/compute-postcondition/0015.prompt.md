Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a non-negative integer, operations is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers, the first integer is either 1 or 2, and the second integer is a non-negative integer, queries is a list of non-negative integers, array is an empty list, result is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for op_type, value in operations:
    if op_type == 1:
        array.append(value)
    else:
        array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a non-negative integer, `operations` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `queries` is a list of non-negative integers. If `op_type` is 1, `array` is a list containing one element which is `value`. If `op_type` is 2, `array` is an empty list. In both cases, `result` is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is a non-negative integer, `operations` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `queries` is a list of non-negative integers. If `op_type` is 1, `array` is a list containing two elements which are `value`. If `op_type` is 2, `array` is a list containing one element which is `value` if the if condition is met, otherwise `array` is still an empty list. In both cases, `result` is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is a non-negative integer, `operations` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `queries` is a list of non-negative integers, `op_type` is the type of the next operation, `value` is the value of the next operation. If `op_type` is 1, `array` has one more element which is `value`. If `op_type` is not 1, `array` contains two times the number of elements it had before, with the original elements duplicated. `result` is an empty list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
