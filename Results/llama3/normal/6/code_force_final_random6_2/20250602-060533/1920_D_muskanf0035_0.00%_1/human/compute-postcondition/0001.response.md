To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`, which means we can only adjust the state of `t`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a list of `n` lists, each containing two integers, `queries` is a list of integers, `t` is at least 1**
