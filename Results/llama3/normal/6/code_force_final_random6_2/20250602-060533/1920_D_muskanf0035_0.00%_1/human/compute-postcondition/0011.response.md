The code prints the result of the function `func_1` with arguments `n`, `operations`, and `queries`. The value of `result` is the output of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`, which is printed using the `*` operator to unpack the list into separate arguments to `print`.

Output: **the result of func_1(n, operations, queries) (where n is the first input integer, operations is a list of n lists containing two integers from stdin, and queries is a list of integers from stdin)**
