Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a list of `n` lists, each containing two integers, `queries` is a list of integers, `t` is an integer**.

In this output state, the value of `t` is an integer that was read from the input, and the values of `n`, `operations`, and `queries` remain unchanged. The input has been consumed to read the value of `t`, so the input is now empty.
