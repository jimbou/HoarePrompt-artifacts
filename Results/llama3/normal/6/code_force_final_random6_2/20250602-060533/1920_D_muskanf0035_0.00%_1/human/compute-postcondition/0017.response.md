Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `operations` is an empty list, `queries` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 query, `array` is a list of non-negative integers, `result` is a list containing the element at index `(k - 1) % len(array)` of `array`, `k` is the first query in the list**

In this output state, the value of `result` has been updated to include the element at index `(k - 1) % len(array)` of `array`. This means that the first query `k` has been processed and the corresponding element from `array` has been appended to `result`. The other variables remain unchanged.
