Based on the precondition, we can analyze the code as follows:

* `n` is an integer equal to the first input integer.
* `q` is an integer equal to the second input integer.
* `operations` is a list of `n` lists, each containing two integers from stdin.
* `queries` is a list of integers from stdin.
* `result` is the output of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`.
* `t` is at least 2.
* stdin is empty.

The code `print(*result)` will print the elements of the `result` list, separated by spaces.

Since `result` is the output of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`, we need to understand what `func_1` does. However, the precondition does not provide any information about the implementation of `func_1`. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact values that will be printed.

However, we can describe the output in terms of the input values:

Output: **the output of func_1(n, operations, queries), where n is the first input integer, operations is a list of n lists containing two integers each from stdin, and queries is a list of integers from stdin**

Note that the output will be a list of values, but we cannot determine the exact values without knowing the implementation of `func_1`.
