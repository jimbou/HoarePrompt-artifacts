To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `k` and `queries`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `queries` list. If the list has at least one more query, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, `queries` has at least 1 query, and `k` is the first query in the list.

For the loop to execute again, `queries` must have at least one more query, and `k` must be the next query in the list.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `operations` is an empty list, `queries` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 queries, `array` is a list of non-negative integers, `result` is a list containing the element at index `(k - 1) % len(array)` of `array`, `k` is the second query in the list**
