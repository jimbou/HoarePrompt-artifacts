The only variable in the loop head is variable  t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be at least 2.
State: **n is an integer equal to the first input integer, q is an integer equal to the second input integer, operations is a list of n lists, each containing two integers from stdin, queries is a list of integers from stdin, result is the output of func_1(n, operations, queries), t is at least 2, stdin is empty, and the result of func_1(n, operations, queries) is printed**
