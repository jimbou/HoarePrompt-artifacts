Based on the precondition, we can deduce the following:

* `n` is an integer equal to the first input integer.
* `q` is an integer equal to the second input integer.
* `operations` is a list of `n` lists, each containing two integers from stdin.
* `queries` is a list of integers from stdin.
* `result` is the output of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`.
* `t` is at least 1.
* stdin is empty.

The `print` statement is `print(*result)`, which means it will print the elements of the `result` list separated by spaces.

Since `result` is the output of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`, we need to understand what `func_1` does. However, the precondition does not provide any information about the implementation of `func_1`. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact values that will be printed.

But we can describe the output in terms of the input values. The output will be a sequence of values that are the result of applying the `func_1` function to the input values `n`, `operations`, and `queries`.

Output: **the result of func_1(n, operations, queries) (where n is the first input integer, operations is a list of n lists of two integers from stdin, and queries is a list of integers from stdin)**
