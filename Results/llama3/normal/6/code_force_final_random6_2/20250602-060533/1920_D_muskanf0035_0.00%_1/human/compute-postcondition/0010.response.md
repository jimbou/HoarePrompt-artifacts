Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first input integer, q is an integer equal to the second input integer, operations is a list of n lists, each containing two integers from stdin, queries is a list of integers from stdin, result is the output of func_1(n, operations, queries), t is at least 3, stdin is empty, and the result of func_1(n, operations, queries) is printed, and the result of func_1(n, operations, queries) is printed**

The code block reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to `n` and `q`, respectively. It then reads `n` lines of two integers each from stdin and stores them in the `operations` list. After that, it reads a list of integers from stdin and stores them in the `queries` list. The function `func_1` is called with `n`, `operations`, and `queries` as arguments, and its output is stored in the `result` variable. The result of `func_1` is then printed. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and stdin is empty after the code execution.
