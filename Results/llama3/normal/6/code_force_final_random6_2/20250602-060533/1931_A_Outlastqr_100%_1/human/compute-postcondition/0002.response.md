The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since stdin contains at least one integer, `n` becomes that integer. Stdin now contains a sequence of integers (the encoded words). The second line initializes an empty string `word`.

Output State: **alphabet is a string of all lowercase English letters, n is an integer, word is an empty string, i is 0, stdin contains a sequence of integers (the encoded words)**
