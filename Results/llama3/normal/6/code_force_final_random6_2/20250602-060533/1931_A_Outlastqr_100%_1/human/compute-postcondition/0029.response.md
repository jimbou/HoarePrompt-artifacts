The only variable in the loop head is variable i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than the integer read from the input, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1.
State: **alphabet is a string of all lowercase English letters, stdin contains a sequence of integers (the encoded words) with one integer removed from the front, i is 2, n is an integer. If n > 52, word is a string that starts with the character at index n - 53 in alphabet followed by 'zz'. If n is between 28 and 52, word is a string 'a' followed by the (n-27)th letter of the alphabet and then 'z'. If n is 27, word is 'aay'. If n is between 3 and 26, word is 'aa' followed by the (n-2)th letter of the alphabet. If n is less than 3, word is 'aa' followed by the (n-2)th letter of the alphabet, and the value of word is being printed**
