Output State: **alphabet is a string of all lowercase English letters, stdin contains a sequence of integers (the encoded words) with one integer removed from the front, i is 1, n is an integer, word is an empty string**

The code snippet reads an integer from the input sequence, assigns it to the variable `n`, and then initializes an empty string `word`. The variable `alphabet` remains unchanged, as it is not affected by the code. The variable `i` also remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The input sequence in stdin is modified, with one integer removed from the front. The variable `n` is assigned the value of the removed integer, and the variable `word` is initialized as an empty string.
