Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `alphabet` is a string of all lowercase English letters, stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (the number of test cases) and then a sequence of integers (the encoded words), each integer is between 3 and 78 (inclusive).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    word = ''
    if n > 52:
        word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
    elif n > 27:
        word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
    elif n == 27:
        word = 'aay'
    else:
        word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
    print(word)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: alphabet is a string of all lowercase English letters, stdin contains a sequence of integers (the encoded words), i is 0. If n > 52, word is a string that contains the (n-53)th letter of the alphabet and 'zz'. If n is less than or equal to 27, word is a string that contains 'aa' and the (n-2)th lowercase English letter, except when n is 27, word is 'aay'. If n is greater than 27 and less than or equal to 52, word is a string that includes 'a', the (n-27)th letter of the alphabet, and 'z. The value of the word is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: alphabet is a string of all lowercase English letters, stdin contains a sequence of integers (the encoded words) with one integer removed from the front, i is 1, n is an integer. If n > 52, word is a string that starts with the character at index n - 53 in alphabet followed by 'zz'. If n is between 28 and 52, word is a string 'a' followed by the (n-27)th letter of the alphabet and then 'z'. If n is 27, word is 'aay'. If n is between 3 and 26, word is 'aa' followed by the (n-2)th letter of the alphabet. If n is less than 3, word is 'aa' followed by the (n-2)th letter of the alphabet, and the value of word is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: alphabet is a string of all lowercase English letters, i is 2, n is an integer, stdin contains a sequence of integers (the encoded words) with two integers removed from the front. If n > 52, word is a string consisting of the (n-53)th letter of the alphabet and 'zz'. If n is between 27 and 52, word is a string of three characters: 'a', the (n-27)th lowercase English letter, and 'z'. If n is 27, word is 'aay'. If n is between 3 and 26, word is 'aa' plus the (n-3)th character of the alphabet. If n is less than 3, word is 'aa', and the value of word is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
