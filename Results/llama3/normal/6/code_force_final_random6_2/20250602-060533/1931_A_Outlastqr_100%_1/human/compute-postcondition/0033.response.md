Output State: **alphabet is a string of all lowercase English letters, i is 2, n is an integer, word is 'aay', stdin contains a sequence of integers (the encoded words) with two integers removed from the front**

In this output state, the value of the variable 'word' has been updated to 'aay'. The other variables, 'alphabet', 'i', and 'n', remain unchanged. The stdin still contains a sequence of integers (the encoded words) with two integers removed from the front.
