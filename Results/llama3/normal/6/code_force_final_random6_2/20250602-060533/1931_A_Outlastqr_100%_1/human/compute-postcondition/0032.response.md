Output State: **`alphabet` is a string of all lowercase English letters, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer, `word` is a string of three characters: 'a', the (n-27)th lowercase English letter, and 'z', stdin contains a sequence of integers (the encoded words) with two integers removed from the front.**

In this output state, the value of `word` has been updated by concatenating 'a', the (n-27)th lowercase English letter (since indexing starts at 0), and 'z'. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains a sequence of integers, but two integers have been removed from the front.
