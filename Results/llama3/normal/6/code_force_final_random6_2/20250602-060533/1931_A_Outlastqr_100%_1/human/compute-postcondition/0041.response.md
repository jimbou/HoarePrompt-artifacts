Functionality: **This function reads a sequence of integers from standard input, where each integer represents an encoded word. It decodes each integer into a three-letter string and prints the decoded word. The function processes multiple test cases, where the number of test cases is provided as the first input. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the standard input empty and prints the decoded words for each test case.**
