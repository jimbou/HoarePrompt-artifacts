Output State: **`alphabet` is a string of all lowercase English letters, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer, `word` is a string consisting of the (n-53)th letter of the alphabet and 'zz', stdin contains a sequence of integers (the encoded words) with two integers removed from the front**

In this output state, the value of `word` has been updated by appending the (n-53)th letter of the alphabet and 'zz' to its initial empty string. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains a sequence of integers, but the first two integers have been removed.
