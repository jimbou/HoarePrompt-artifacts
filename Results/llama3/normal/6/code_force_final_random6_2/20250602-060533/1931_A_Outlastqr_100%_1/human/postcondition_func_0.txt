This function reads a series of integers from standard input, generates a string based on each integer according to specific rules, and prints the generated strings. The function takes no arguments and returns no value, but it consumes all input from standard input and produces output strings. The rules for generating strings are based on the value of the input integers, which are used to select characters from the lowercase English alphabet. The function processes all input integers and prints the corresponding strings before terminating.
