Output State: **`alphabet` is a string of all lowercase English letters, `stdin` contains a sequence of integers (the encoded words) with one integer removed from the front, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer, `word` is 'aay'**

In this output state, the value of `word` has been updated to 'aay', while the values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The `alphabet` is still a string of all lowercase English letters, `stdin` still contains a sequence of integers with one integer removed from the front, `i` is still 1, and `n` is still an integer.
