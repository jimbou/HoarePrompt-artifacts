Output State: **alphabet is a string of all lowercase English letters, stdin is empty, i is equal to the number of test cases, n is the last integer in the sequence of integers, and word is the last string printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the alphabet remains unchanged, the standard input is empty because all the integers have been read, the loop counter `i` is equal to the number of test cases, `n` is the last integer in the sequence of integers, and `word` is the last string printed, which is the decoded word corresponding to the last integer `n`.
