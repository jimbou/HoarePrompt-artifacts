To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and the input from `stdin`. The loop will execute if the input from `stdin` is at least 1. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `stdin` to have at least one integer input.

State: **`alphabet` is a string of all lowercase English letters, stdin contains at least one integer (the number of test cases) and then a sequence of integers (the encoded words), each integer is between 3 and 78 (inclusive), `i` is 0**
