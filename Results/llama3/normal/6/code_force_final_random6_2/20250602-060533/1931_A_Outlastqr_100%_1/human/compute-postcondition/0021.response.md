Output State: **`alphabet` is a string of all lowercase English letters, stdin contains a sequence of integers (the encoded words) with one integer removed from the front, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer, `word` is a string 'a' followed by the  (n-27)th letter of the alphabet and then 'z'.**

In this output state, the value of `word` has been updated by appending 'a', the (n-27)th letter of the alphabet, and 'z' to its initial empty string. The other variables remain unchanged.
