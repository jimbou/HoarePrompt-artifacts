Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly determines the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have been encoded. The program uses the ASCII values of the letters to calculate the encoded word. It first checks if the encoded word is greater than 52, in which case it subtracts 53 from the encoded word and adds the corresponding letter from the alphabet to the word, followed by 'zz'. If the encoded word is between 27 and 52, it adds 'a' to the word, followed by the corresponding letter from the alphabet, and then 'z'. If the encoded word is 27, it sets the word to 'aay'. If the encoded word is less than 27, it adds 'aa' to the word, followed by the corresponding letter from the alphabet.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where the encoded word is 27 or less than 27. It also correctly handles the case where the encoded word is greater than 52. The program's logic is sound, and it produces the correct output for all possible inputs.

Therefore, the program is correct, and the answer is **True**.
