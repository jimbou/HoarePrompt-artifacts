Output State: **`alphabet` is a string of all lowercase English letters, `n` is an integer greater than 27 and less than or equal to 52, `word` is a string that includes 'a', the (n-27)th letter of the alphabet, and 'z', `i` is 0, stdin contains a sequence of integers (the encoded words).**

In this output state, the value of `word` has been updated to include 'a', the (n-27)th letter of the alphabet, and 'z'. The value of `n` is still an integer greater than 27 and less than or equal to 52. The values of `alphabet` and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains a sequence of integers (the encoded words).
