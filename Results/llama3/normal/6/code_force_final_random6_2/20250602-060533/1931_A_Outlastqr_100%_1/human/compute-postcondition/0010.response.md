Output State: **alphabet is a string of all lowercase English letters, n is 27, word is 'aay', i is 0, stdin contains a sequence of integers (the encoded words)**

In this output state, the value of the variable 'word' has been updated to 'aay'. The other variables, 'alphabet', 'n', 'i', and the contents of stdin, remain unchanged. The value of 'n' is still 27, which is less than or equal to 27 as specified in the initial state.
