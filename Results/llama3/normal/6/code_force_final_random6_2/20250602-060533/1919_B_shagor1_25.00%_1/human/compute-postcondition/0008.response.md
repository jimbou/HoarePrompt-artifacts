The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `s`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` has at least 2 characters the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has `n-1` characters, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, `stdin` has at least 1 test case left. So for the loop to be executed one more time the string `s` must have at least `n-2` characters and the first character of `s` is the second character of the original string `s`. If the second character of the original string `s` is '-', `neg` is 2, otherwise `neg` is 1.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n-2` consisting of characters "+" and "-", the number of test cases in `stdin` is decreased by 1, `neg` is 2 if the second character of the original string `s` is '-', otherwise `neg` is 1**
