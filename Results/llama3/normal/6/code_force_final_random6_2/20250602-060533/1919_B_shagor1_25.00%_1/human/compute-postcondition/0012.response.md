The code prints the result of the expression `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise it prints `n`. Since `neg` is the number of '-' characters in the original string `s` and `s` is an empty string, `neg` is 0. Therefore, the expression `n - 2 * neg` simplifies to `n - 2 * 0`, which is equal to `n`. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, the print statement will output the value of `n`.

Output: **n (where n is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive)**
