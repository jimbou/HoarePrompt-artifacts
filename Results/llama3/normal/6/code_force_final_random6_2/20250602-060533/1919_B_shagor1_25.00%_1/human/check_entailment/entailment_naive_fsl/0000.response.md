Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty for the given string s. The program counts the number of '-' characters in the string and calculates the penalty as n - 2 * neg if n is not equal to neg, otherwise, it returns n.

The program works correctly for all possible cases because it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The penalty is calculated as the absolute value of the sum of the array multiplied by its length. By counting the number of '-' characters, the program effectively calculates the sum of the array, and then calculates the penalty accordingly.

The program also handles edge cases correctly, such as when the string consists only of '+' characters (in which case the penalty is 0) or when the string consists only of '-' characters (in which case the penalty is equal to the length of the string).

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all possible inputs.
