Reasoning:

The problem asks to find the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting an array into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty of each subarray. The penalty of a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The given program calculates the number of '-' characters in the input string and then prints the minimum possible penalty. The calculation is based on the fact that the optimal way to split the array is to group all '+' characters together and all '-' characters together. This is because the penalty of a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length, so grouping all '+' characters together will result in a subarray with a sum of 1 and a length equal to the number of '+' characters, and similarly for '-' characters.

The program correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty by subtracting twice the number of '-' characters from the total length of the array. This is because each '-' character contributes -1 to the sum of the subarray, and the penalty is the absolute value of the sum multiplied by the length. By subtracting twice the number of '-' characters, the program effectively calculates the minimum possible penalty.

However, there is a special case when the number of '+' characters is equal to the number of '-' characters. In this case, the minimum possible penalty is equal to the total length of the array, because the optimal way to split the array is to group all '+' characters together and all '-' characters together, resulting in two subarrays with sums of 1 and -1, respectively. The program correctly handles this special case by printing the total length of the array when the number of '+' characters is equal to the number of '-' characters.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
