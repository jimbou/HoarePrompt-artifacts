Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n-2` consisting of characters "+" and "-", the number of test cases in `stdin` is decreased by 1, `neg` is 3 if the second character of the original string `s` is '-', otherwise `neg` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `neg` has been incremented by 1. If the second character of the original string `s` is '-', then `neg` is now 3, otherwise it is 2. The values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged, and the number of test cases in `stdin` is still decreased by 1.
