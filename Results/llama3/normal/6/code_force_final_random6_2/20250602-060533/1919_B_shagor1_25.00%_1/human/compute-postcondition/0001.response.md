To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `s`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` has at least 1 character, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, which ensures that `s` has at least 1 character. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `s` to have at least 1 character and `i` to be the first character in `s`.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters "+" and "-" that must have at least 1 character, `neg` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `i` is the first character in `s`**
