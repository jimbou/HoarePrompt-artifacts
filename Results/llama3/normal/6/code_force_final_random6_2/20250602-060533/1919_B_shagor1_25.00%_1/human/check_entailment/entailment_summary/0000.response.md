Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting an array into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The program correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty by counting the number of '-' characters in the string and subtracting twice this count from the total length of the string. This is because each '-' character contributes -1 to the sum of the array, and each '+' character contributes 1. By subtracting twice the count of '-' characters, the program effectively calculates the difference between the number of '+' characters and '-' characters, which is the minimum possible penalty.

The program also handles the case where the number of '+' characters equals the number of '-' characters, in which case the minimum possible penalty is the total length of the string.

Therefore, the program is correct and produces the expected output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
