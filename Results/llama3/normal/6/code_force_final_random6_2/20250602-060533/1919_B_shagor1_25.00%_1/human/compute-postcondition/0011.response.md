Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, s is an empty string, neg is equal to the number of '-' characters in the original string s, stdin contains 0 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the string `s` becomes empty, the number of test cases in `stdin` is reduced to 0, and the variable `neg` counts the total number of '-' characters in the original string `s`. The value of `n` remains unchanged.
