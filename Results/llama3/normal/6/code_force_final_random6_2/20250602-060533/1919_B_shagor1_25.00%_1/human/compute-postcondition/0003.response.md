The code increments the value of `neg` by 1. The initial value of `neg` is 0, so after the code is executed, `neg` becomes 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The first character `i` of `s` is still '-', and `s` is still a string of length `n` consisting of characters "+" and "-" that must have at least 1 character. `n` is still an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive. stdin still contains multiple test cases - 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters "+" and "-" that must have at least 1 character and the first character `i` of `s` is '-', `neg` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1.**
