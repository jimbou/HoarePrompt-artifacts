The code increments the value of `neg` by 1. Initially, `neg` is 1 if the first character of `s` is '-', otherwise it remains 0. So, after the increment, `neg` will be 2 if the first character of `s` is '-', otherwise it will be 1.

The values of the other variables are not affected. `n` is still an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, `s` is still a string of length `n-1` consisting of characters "+" and "-", and the number of test cases in `stdin` is still decreased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n-1` consisting of characters "+" and "-", `neg` is 2 if the first character of `s` is '-', otherwise `neg` is 1, the number of test cases in `stdin` is decreased by 1.**
