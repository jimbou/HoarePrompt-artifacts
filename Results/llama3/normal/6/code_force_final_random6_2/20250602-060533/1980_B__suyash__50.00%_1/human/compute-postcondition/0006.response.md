Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `i` is 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a list of three integers, `o` is a list of strings, `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `k` is an integer equal to `n`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop, 'YES' is being printed**

The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop and moves to the next iteration. Since there are no changes to the variables, their values remain the same. The only effect is that we move to the next iteration of the loop, and 'YES' is still being printed.
