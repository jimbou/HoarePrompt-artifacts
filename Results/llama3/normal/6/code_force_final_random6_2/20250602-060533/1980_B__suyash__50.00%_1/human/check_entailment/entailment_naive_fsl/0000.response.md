Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when the favorite cube's value is the same as the value of the cube at the k-th position after sorting. In this case, the program should output "MAYBE" because the favorite cube may or may not be removed, depending on its position in the sorted list. However, the program does not consider this case and outputs "YES" or "NO" incorrectly.

For example, if the input is:

5 2 2
4 3 3 2 3

The program outputs "MAYBE", but it should output "YES" because the favorite cube (with value 3) will always be removed, regardless of its position in the sorted list.

This is because the program only checks if the favorite cube's value is greater than or equal to the value of the cube at the k-th position after sorting, but it does not consider the case when the favorite cube's value is equal to the value of the cube at the k-th position.
