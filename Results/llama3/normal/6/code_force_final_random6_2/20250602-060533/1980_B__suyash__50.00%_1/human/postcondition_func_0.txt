This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the result for each case. It takes no parameters and returns no value. The function reads an integer t, representing the number of test cases, followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains three integers n, f, and k, and the second line contains n integers. The function then determines whether a favorite number (fav) is among the top k most frequent numbers in the list. If k equals n, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it sorts the list in descending order and checks if fav is among the top k numbers. If fav is not among the top k numbers, it prints 'NO'. If fav is among the top k numbers, it prints 'YES' if k is greater than or equal to 0, 'MAYBE' if k is less than 0 but fav is among the top k numbers, and 'NO' otherwise. The function repeats this process for each test case.
