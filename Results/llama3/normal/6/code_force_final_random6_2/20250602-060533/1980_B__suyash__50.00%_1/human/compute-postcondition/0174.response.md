Postcondition: **The program continues execution without any changes if `k` is not less than 0 and `fav` is not equal to `l[i]`. If `k` is less than 0, then 'MAYBE' is printed and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `fav` is equal to `l[i]` and the index of `fav` in `o` is less than or equal to `k - 1`. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
