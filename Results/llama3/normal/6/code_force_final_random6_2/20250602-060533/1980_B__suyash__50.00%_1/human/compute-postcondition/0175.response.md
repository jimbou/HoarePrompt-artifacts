Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `i` is less than the length of `l` and increased by 1, `a` is a string of space-separated integers, `b` is a list of three integers, `o` is a list of strings sorted in descending order, `n` is an integer equal to the first element of `b`, `f` is an integer equal to the second element of `b`, `dic` is a dictionary where each key is a string from `o` and each value is the count of that string in `o`, `l` is a list of unique strings from `o` sorted in descending order and has at least `i+1` elements, `k` is an integer equal to the third element of `b` minus the count of the string at index `i` in `l` in the list `o` minus the count of `l[i]` in `o`. If `k` is less than or equal to 0, 'NO' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k` is not less than 0 and `fav` is not equal to `l[i]`, the program continues execution without any changes. If `k` is less than 0 and `fav` is equal to `l[i]` and the index of `fav` in `o` is less than or equal to `k - 1`, then 'MAYBE' is printed and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k` is less than 0 and `fav` is equal to `l[i]` and the index of `fav` in `o` is greater than `k - 1`, then 'YES' is printed and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
