Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether Dmitry's favorite cube will be removed or not. 

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It first checks if the number of cubes removed (k) is equal to the total number of cubes (n). If so, it prints "YES" because all cubes, including the favorite one, will be removed.

2. It then checks if the index of the favorite cube in the sorted list of cube values is greater than k-1. If so, it prints "NO" because the favorite cube will not be removed.

3. If the favorite cube's index is not greater than k-1, it then checks the values of the cubes that will be removed. It subtracts the count of each value from k until it reaches the favorite cube's value. If k becomes less than or equal to 0 before reaching the favorite cube's value, it prints "NO" because the favorite cube will not be removed. If k becomes less than 0 when it reaches the favorite cube's value, it prints "MAYBE" because the favorite cube may or may not be removed. If k is still greater than 0 when it reaches the favorite cube's value, it prints "YES" because the favorite cube will be removed.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct output based on the input values.

Correctness: **True**
