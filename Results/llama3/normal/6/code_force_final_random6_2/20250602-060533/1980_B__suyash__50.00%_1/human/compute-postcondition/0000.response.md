The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by `t` test cases. So, `t` is assigned the value of this integer, and stdin now contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers `n`, `f`, and `k` (1 <= f, k <= n <= 100). The second line contains `n` integers `a_i` (1 <= a_i <= 100).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers `n`, `f`, and `k` (1 <= f, k <= n <= 100). The second line contains `n` integers `a_i` (1 <= a_i <= 100).**
