Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1.  The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
2.  For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `f`, and `k`, representing the number of cubes, the index of Dmitry's favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes, respectively.
3.  It then reads `n` integers representing the values shown on the cubes.
4.  If `k` is equal to `n`, it prints "YES" because all cubes will be removed.
5.  It finds the value of the favorite cube `fav` and creates a dictionary `dic` to store the count of each value in the list.
6.  The list is sorted in descending order, and the index of the favorite cube is found.
7.  If the index of the favorite cube is greater than `k - 1`, it prints "NO" because the favorite cube will not be removed.
8.  It then iterates through the sorted list of unique values. For each value, it subtracts the count of that value from `k`. If `k` becomes less than or equal to 0, it prints "NO" because the favorite cube will not be removed.
9.  If the favorite cube is found and `k` is greater than 0, it prints "YES" because the favorite cube will be removed. If `k` is less than 0, it prints "MAYBE" because the favorite cube may or may not be removed.

Correctness: **True**
