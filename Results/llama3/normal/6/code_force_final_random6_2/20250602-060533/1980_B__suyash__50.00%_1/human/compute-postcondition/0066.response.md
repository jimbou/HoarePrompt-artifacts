State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `i` is equal to the length of `l` plus 1, `a` is a string, `b` is a list of three integers, `o` is a list of strings sorted in descending order, `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `dic` is a dictionary where each key is a string from `o` and each value is the count of that string in `o`, `l` is a list of unique strings from `o` sorted in descending order, `k` is an integer, and `fav` is a string equal to the element at index `f-1` in the sorted list `o`. If `fav` is not equal to any string in `l`, then `k` is an integer minus the sum of counts of all strings in `l` in `o`. If `k` is less than or equal to 0, 'NO' is printed. If `fav` is equal to any string in `l`, then `k` is an integer decreased by the count of `fav` in `o`. If `k` is less than 0, 'MAYBE' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.**
