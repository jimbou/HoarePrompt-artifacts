Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `i` is 1, `a` is a string, `b` is a list of three integers, `o` is a list of strings sorted in descending order, `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `dic` is a dictionary where each key is a string from `o` and each value is the count of that string in `o`, `l` is a list of unique strings from `o` sorted in descending order that must have at least 2 elements. If `k` is less than 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and 'YES' is printed.**
