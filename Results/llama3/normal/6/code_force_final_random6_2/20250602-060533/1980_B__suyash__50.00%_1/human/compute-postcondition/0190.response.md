Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `i` is increased by 1, `a` is a string of space-separated integers, `b` is a list of three integers, `o` is a list of strings sorted in descending order, `n` is an integer equal to the first element of `b`, `f` is an integer equal to the second element of `b`, `dic` is a dictionary where each key is a string from `o` and each value is the count of that string in `o`, `l` is a list of unique strings from `o` sorted in descending order and has at least `i+1` elements. If `fav` is not equal to `l[i]`, then if `k` is less than or equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs. If `fav` is equal to `l[i]`, then `k` is an integer equal to the third element of `b` minus the count of the string at index `i` in `l` in the list `o` minus the count of `l[i]` in `o` minus the count of `l[i]` in `dic`. If `k` is less than 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and 'YES' is printed.***
