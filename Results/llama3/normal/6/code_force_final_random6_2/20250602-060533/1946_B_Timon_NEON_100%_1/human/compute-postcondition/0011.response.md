Output State: **arr is a list of integers that is not empty, new_segment is a list containing at least one integer equal to its original value plus the value at index i in arr, max_segment is a list containing two integers, the first integer is equal to the value at index i in arr, the second integer is 0, segments_variants is an empty list, max_sum is -1, the current value of i is 0, and the element at index i in arr is not less than 0.**

The code modifies the values of `max_segment` and `new_segment` by adding the value at index `i` in `arr` to their first elements. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the element at index `i` in `arr` is not less than 0. The rest of the variables (`arr`, `segments_variants`, and `max_sum`) are not affected by the code.
