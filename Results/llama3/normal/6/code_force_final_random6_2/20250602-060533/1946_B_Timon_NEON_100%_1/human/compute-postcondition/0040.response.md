Postcondition: ***arr is a list of integers that is not empty and has at least 2 elements, new_segment is a list containing at least one integer, max_segment is a list containing at least one integer, segments_variants is a list containing one or two elements which are either max_segment + [i - 1] if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0] or new_segment + [i - 1] if max_segment[0] <= new_segment[0], max_sum is -1, and the current value of i is 2. If new_segment is not empty, then if arr[i] < 0, new_segment is an empty list, max_segment's first element is incremented by arr[i]. Otherwise, new_segment's first element is incremented by arr[2], max_segment's first element is incremented by arr[2]. If new_segment is empty, then new_segment is a list containing arr[2] and 2, and segments_variants is a list containing one or two elements which are either max_segment + [i - 1] if max_segment[0] > arr[2] or arr[2] + [2 - 1] if max_segment[0] <= arr[2], and max_segment[0] is either max_segment[0] + arr[2] (if max_segment[0] > arr[2]) or arr[2] + arr[2] (if max_segment[0] <= arr[2]).***
