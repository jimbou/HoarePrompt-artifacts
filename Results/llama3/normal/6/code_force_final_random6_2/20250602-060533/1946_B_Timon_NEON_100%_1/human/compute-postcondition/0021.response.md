Output State: **arr is a list of integers that is not empty, new_segment is a list containing at least one integer, max_segment is a list containing at least one integer and is equal to new_segment, segments_variants is a list containing two elements which are either max_segment + [i - 1] if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0] or new_segment + [i - 1] if max_segment[0] <= new_segment[0], and new_segment + [i - 1], max_sum is -1, and the current value of i is 1**

In this output state, the list `arr` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The list `new_segment` also remains unchanged. The list `max_segment` is updated to be equal to `new_segment`. The list `segments_variants` now contains two elements: the original element which is either `max_segment + [i - 1]` if `max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]` or `new_segment + [i - 1]` if `max_segment[0] <= new_segment[0]`, and the new element `new_segment + [i - 1]`. The variable `max_sum` remains unchanged at -1. The value of `i` remains at 1.
