Output State: **arr is a list of integers, new_segment is an empty list, max_segment is a list containing the maximum sum of a subarray of arr and the index of the first element of that subarray, segments_variants is a list containing one or more elements which are either max_segment + [i - 1] if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0] or new_segment + [i - 1] if max_segment[0] <= new_segment[0], max_sum is the maximum sum of a subarray of arr, total_max_segment is [-1].**

The code appends two new elements to the segments_variants list: max_segment + [len(arr) - 1] and new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]. The value of max_segment and new_segment remains unchanged. The variable total_max_segment is assigned a new value of [-1]. The values of arr, max_sum, and the existing elements in segments_variants are not affected by the code.
