Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that is not empty, `new_segment` is a list containing at least one integer, `max_segment` is a list containing at least one integer where `max_segment[0]` is updated to `max_segment[0] + arr[1]`, `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is either `max_segment + [i - 1]` if `max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]` or `new_segment + [i - 1]` if `max_segment[0] <= new_segment[0]`, `max_sum` is -1, and the current value of `i` is 1. If `arr[i] >= 0`, then `new_segment` is set to `[arr[1], 1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `max_segment[0]` has been updated by adding the value of `arr[1]` to it. The other variables remain unchanged, but their relationships and conditions are still valid. Note that `i` is still 1, and `arr[i]` is used to determine the value of `new_segment`.
