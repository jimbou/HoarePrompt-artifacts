Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is a list containing the maximum sum of a subarray of `arr` and the index of the first element of that subarray, `segments_variants` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `max_sum` is the maximum sum of a subarray of `arr`. If the sum of the second segment in `segments_variants` is larger than the sum of the current `total_max_segment` and the second segment is not a single-element segment, then `total_max_segment` is updated to the second segment in `segments_variants`. Otherwise, `total_max_segment` remains unchanged.***
