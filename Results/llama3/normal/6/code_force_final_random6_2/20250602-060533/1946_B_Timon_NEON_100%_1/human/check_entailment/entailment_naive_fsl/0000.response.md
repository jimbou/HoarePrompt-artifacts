Correctness: **False**.

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum possible sum of the array after k operations. The problem description requires the program to insert the sum of any contiguous subarray anywhere in the array, but the program does not correctly implement this logic.

One potential case where the program does not work correctly is when the input array contains negative numbers. The program's `func_2` function tries to find the maximum segment of positive numbers, but it does not correctly handle the case where the maximum segment is not contiguous. For example, if the input array is `[-1, 2, -3, 4, -5]`, the program will incorrectly identify the maximum segment as `[2, 4]` instead of `[-1, 2, -3, 4, -5]`.

Additionally, the program's `func_3` function is incomplete and does not implement the logic to calculate the maximum possible sum after k operations.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
