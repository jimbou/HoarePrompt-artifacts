Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is a list containing the maximum sum of a subarray of `arr` and the index of the first element of that subarray, `segments_variants` is a list containing at least one element, `max_sum` is the maximum sum of a subarray of `arr`, and `total_max_segment` is a list containing the maximum sum of a subarray of `arr` and the index of the first element of that subarray, which is the maximum of all segments in `segments_variants` with more than one element.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `total_max_segment` will contain the maximum sum of a subarray of `arr` and the index of the first element of that subarray, which is the maximum of all segments in `segments_variants` with more than one element. The other variables remain unchanged.
