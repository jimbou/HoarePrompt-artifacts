Output State: **arr is a list of integers that is not empty, new_segment is an empty list, max_segment is a list containing at least one integer and its first element is incremented by the value of arr[i], segments_variants is a list containing two elements which are either max_segment + [i - 1] and max_segment + [i - 1] if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0] or new_segment + [i - 1] and new_segment + [i - 1] if max_segment[0] <= new_segment[0], max_sum is -1, and the current value of i is 1**

In this output state, the value of new_segment has been reset to an empty list. The first element of max_segment has been incremented by the value of arr[i]. The value of segments_variants depends on the comparison between the first element of max_segment and new_segment. If max_segment[0] is greater than new_segment[0], segments_variants will contain two lists: max_segment + [i - 1] and max_segment + [i - 1]. If max_segment[0] is less than or equal to new_segment[0], segments_variants will contain two lists: new_segment + [i - 1] and new_segment + [i - 1]. The value of max_sum remains unchanged at -1, and the current value of i remains at 1.
