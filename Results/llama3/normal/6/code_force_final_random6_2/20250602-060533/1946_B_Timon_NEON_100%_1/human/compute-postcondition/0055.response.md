Functionality: **This function takes a list of integers as input and returns a list containing the maximum sum of a subarray and the index of the first element of that subarray. The function identifies the maximum sum of a subarray by considering all possible segments in the input list, where a segment is a contiguous subarray with more than one element. The function returns the maximum sum and the starting index of the corresponding segment.**
