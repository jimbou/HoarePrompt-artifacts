Output State: **arr is a list of integers that is not empty and has at least 2 elements, new_segment is a list containing at least one integer, max_segment is a list containing at least one integer, segments_variants is a list containing three elements which are either max_segment + [i - 1] if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0] or new_segment + [i - 1] if max_segment[0] <= new_segment[0], max_sum is -1, and the current value of i is 2**

In this output state, the value of segments_variants has been updated to include a new element, which is max_segment + [i - 1]. The other variables remain unchanged. The list segments_variants now contains three elements, where the new element is a combination of max_segment and the value of i minus 1.
