Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is a list containing the maximum sum of a subarray of `arr` and the index of the first element of that subarray, `segments_variants` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `max_sum` is the maximum sum of a subarray of `arr`, `total_max_segment` is the second element in `segments_variants`, and `segment` is the second element in `segments_variants`.**

In this output state, the value of `total_max_segment` has been updated to be equal to the second element in `segments_variants`, which is also the value of `segment`. The other variables remain unchanged.
