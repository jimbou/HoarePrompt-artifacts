Postcondition: ***arr is a list of integers that is not empty, new_segment is a list containing at least one integer, max_segment is a list containing at least one integer, segments_variants is a list containing one element which is either max_segment + [i - 1] if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0] or new_segment + [i - 1] if max_segment[0] <= new_segment[0], max_sum is -1, and the current value of i is 0. If arr[i] is less than 0, new_segment is an empty list and max_segment's first element is incremented by the value of arr[i]. If arr[i] is not less than 0, new_segment is a list containing at least one integer equal to its original value plus the value at index i in arr, max_segment is a list containing two integers, the first integer is equal to the value at index i in arr, the second integer is 0. If new_segment is empty, then new_segment is a list containing the current value of arr[i] and i if arr[i] is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise new_segment is empty, max_segment is a list containing arr[0] and 0, segments_variants is an empty list, max_sum is -1, and i is 0.***
