Output State: **arr is a list of integers that is not empty, new_segment is a list containing the current value of arr[i] and i, max_segment is a list containing two zeros, segments_variants is an empty list, max_sum is -1, i is 0, and the current value of arr[i] is greater than or equal to 0.**

In this output state, the value of `new_segment` has been updated to a list containing the current value of `arr[i]` and `i`, which means it now holds the first element of the current segment and its index. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `arr`, `max_segment`, `segments_variants`, `max_sum`, and `i` are still valid.
