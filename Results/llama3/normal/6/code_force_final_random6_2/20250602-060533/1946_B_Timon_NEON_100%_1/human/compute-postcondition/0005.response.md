Output State: **arr is a list of integers that is not empty, new_segment is a list containing at least one integer, max_segment is a list containing two integers where the first integer is greater than the first integer of new_segment, segments_variants is a list containing one element which is max_segment + [i - 1], max_sum is -1, and the current value of i is 0. The current value of arr[i] is less than 0**

In this output state, the value of segments_variants has been updated to include a new element which is the concatenation of max_segment and the list containing the value i - 1. The value of i - 1 is -1 since the current value of i is 0. Therefore, segments_variants now contains one element which is max_segment + [-1]. The values of the other variables remain the same.
