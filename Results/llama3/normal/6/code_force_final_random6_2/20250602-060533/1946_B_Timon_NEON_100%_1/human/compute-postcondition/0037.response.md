Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that is not empty and has at least 2 elements, `new_segment` is a list containing `arr[2]` and `2`, `max_segment` is a list containing at least one integer, `segments_variants` is a list containing one or two elements which are either `max_segment` + `[i - 1]` if `max_segment[0]` > `arr[2]` or `arr[2]` + `[2 - 1]` if `max_segment[0]` <= `arr[2]`, `max_sum` is -1, and the current value of `i` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `new_segment` has been updated to contain the element at index 2 of the list `arr` and the value 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `segments_variants` still contains one or two elements, which are determined by the comparison between the first element of `max_segment` and the element at index 2 of `arr`.
