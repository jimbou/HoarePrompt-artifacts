The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `arr`. If `i` is less than `len(arr)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers that is not empty. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 and `arr` must have at least 2 elements.
State: **arr is a list of integers that is not empty and has at least 2 elements, new_segment is a list containing at least one integer, max_segment is a list containing at least one integer, segments_variants is a list containing one or two elements which are either max_segment + [i - 1] if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0] or new_segment + [i - 1] if max_segment[0] <= new_segment[0], max_sum is -1, and the current value of i is 2**
