Output State: **arr is a list of integers that is not empty and has at least 2 elements, new_segment is an empty list, max_segment is a list containing at least one integer with its first element incremented by arr[i], segments_variants is a list containing two or three elements which are new_segment + [i - 1], max_sum is -1, and the current value of i is 2.**

The code snippet modifies the `new_segment` and `max_segment` lists. The first line assigns an empty list to `new_segment`, effectively clearing its contents. The second line increments the first element of `max_segment` by the value of `arr[i]`, where `i` is 2. This means that the first element of `max_segment` is increased by the value of the third element in the `arr` list (since indexing starts at 0). The other variables, including `arr`, `segments_variants`, `max_sum`, and `i`, remain unchanged.
