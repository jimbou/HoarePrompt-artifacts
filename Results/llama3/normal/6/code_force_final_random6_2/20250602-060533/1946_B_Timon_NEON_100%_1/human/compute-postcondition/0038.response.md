Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers that is not empty and has at least 2 elements, `max_sum` is -1, and the current value of `i` is 2. If `arr[2]` is non-negative, `new_segment` is a list containing `arr[2]` and `2`, and `segments_variants` is a list containing one or two elements which are either `max_segment` + `[i - 1]` if `max_segment[0]` > `arr[2]` or `arr[2]` + `[2 - 1]` if `max_segment[0]` <= `arr[2]`.***
