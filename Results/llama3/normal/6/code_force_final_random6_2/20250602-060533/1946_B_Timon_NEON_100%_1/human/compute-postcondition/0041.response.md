Output State: **arr is a list of integers, new_segment is an empty list, max_segment is a list containing the maximum sum of a subarray of arr and the index of the first element of that subarray, segments_variants is a list containing one or more elements which are either max_segment + [i - 1] if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0] or new_segment + [i - 1] if max_segment[0] <= new_segment[0], max_sum is the maximum sum of a subarray of arr.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list 'arr' remains unchanged, 'new_segment' is reset to an empty list, 'max_segment' contains the maximum sum of a subarray of 'arr' and the index of the first element of that subarray, 'segments_variants' contains one or more subarrays of 'arr' with their corresponding maximum sums, and 'max_sum' is the maximum sum of a subarray of 'arr'.
