To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `arr`. Since `arr` is not modified in the loop head, we only need to adjust `i`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than the length of `arr`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `arr` is a list of integers that is not empty. To execute the loop again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **arr is a list of integers that is not empty, new_segment is a list containing at least one integer, max_segment is a list containing at least one integer, segments_variants is a list containing one element which is either max_segment + [i - 1] if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0] or new_segment + [i - 1] if max_segment[0] <= new_segment[0], max_sum is -1, and the current value of i is 1**
