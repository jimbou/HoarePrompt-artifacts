To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the loop head and how it affects the state of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for segment in segments_variants:`. This means that the only variable whose state can be adjusted is `segment`, as it is the variable being iterated over in the loop.

Given that `segments_variants` is a list containing at least 2 elements, and assuming that the loop has already executed once (since we are given the state at the end of the previous iteration), we can infer that `segment` has already taken on the value of the first element in `segments_variants`.

For the loop to execute again, `segment` should take on the value of the next element in `segments_variants`. Since `segments_variants` has at least 2 elements, we can conclude that `segment` should be the second element in `segments_variants`.

The states of the other variables (`arr`, `new_segment`, `max_segment`, `segments_variants`, `max_sum`, and `total_max_segment`) do not need to be adjusted, as they are not directly involved in the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is a list containing the maximum sum of a subarray of `arr` and the index of the first element of that subarray, `segments_variants` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `max_sum` is the maximum sum of a subarray of `arr`, `total_max_segment` is either updated or remains unchanged, and `segment` is the second element in `segments_variants`.**
