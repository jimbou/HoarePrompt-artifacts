Output State: **arr is a list of integers that is not empty and has at least 2 elements, new_segment is a list containing at least one integer, max_segment is a list containing at least one integer and equal to new_segment, segments_variants is a list containing two or three elements which are either max_segment + [i - 1] if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0] or new_segment + [i - 1] if max_segment[0] <= new_segment[0], max_sum is -1, and the current value of i is 2**

In this output state, the value of `arr` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `new_segment` also remains the same. The value of `max_segment` is updated to be equal to `new_segment`. The value of `segments_variants` is updated by appending `new_segment + [i - 1]` to its previous value, resulting in a list containing two or three elements. The value of `max_sum` remains unchanged at -1. The value of `i` remains at 2.
