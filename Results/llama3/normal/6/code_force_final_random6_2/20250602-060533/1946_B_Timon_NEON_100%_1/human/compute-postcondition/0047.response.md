The only object in the loop head is variable  segment and list  segments_variants, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the segments_variants.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, segments_variants has at least 1 element, segment is the first element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the segment is the second element in the list.
State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is a list containing the maximum sum of a subarray of `arr` and the index of the first element of that subarray, `segments_variants` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `max_sum` is the maximum sum of a subarray of `arr`, `total_max_segment` is either the first element of `segments_variants` or remains unchanged**
