Postcondition: ***arr is a list of integers that is not empty, new_segment is a list containing at least one integer, max_segment is a list containing at least one integer, segments_variants is a list containing one or two elements which are either max_segment + [i - 1] if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0] or new_segment + [i - 1] if max_segment[0] <= new_segment[0], max_sum is -1, and the current value of i is 1. If new_segment is not empty, then if arr[i] < 0, new_segment is an empty list, max_segment's first element is incremented by the value of arr[i], and segments_variants contains two elements. Otherwise, new_segment's first element is incremented by arr[1], max_segment's first element is incremented by arr[1], and segments_variants contains one element. If new_segment is empty, then max_segment's first element is updated to max_segment[0] + arr[1], and if arr[i] >= 0, then new_segment is set to [arr[1], 1].***
