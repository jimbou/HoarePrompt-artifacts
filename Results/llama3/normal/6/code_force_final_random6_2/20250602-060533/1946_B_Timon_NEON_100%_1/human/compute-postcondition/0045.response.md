Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is a list containing the maximum sum of a subarray of `arr` and the index of the first element of that subarray, `segments_variants` is a list containing at least one element, `max_sum` is the maximum sum of a subarray of `arr`, `total_max_segment` is a list containing the first element of `segments_variants`, `segment` is the first element of `segments_variants`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of integers `arr`, the empty list `new_segment`, the list containing the maximum sum of a subarray of `arr` and its starting index `max_segment`, the list containing at least one element `segments_variants`, the maximum sum of a subarray of `arr` `max_sum`, and the list containing the first element of `segments_variants` `total_max_segment` and `segment` are still the same. The only change is that `total_max_segment` now contains the first element of `segments_variants`.
