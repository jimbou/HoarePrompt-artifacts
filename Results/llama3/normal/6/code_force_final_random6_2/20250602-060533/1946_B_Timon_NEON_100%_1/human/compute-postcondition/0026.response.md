Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that is not empty, `new_segment` is a list containing at least one integer and is equal to `[arr[1], 1]`, `max_segment` is a list containing at least one integer, `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is either `max_segment + [i - 1]` if `max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]` or `new_segment + [i - 1]` if `max_segment[0] <= new_segment[0]`, `max_sum` is -1, and the current value of `i` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `new_segment` has been updated to `[arr[1], 1]`, which means it now contains the second element of the `arr` list and the value 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The `segments_variants` list still contains one element, which is determined by the comparison between `max_segment[0]` and `new_segment[0]`. The `max_sum` variable is still -1, and the value of `i` is still 1.
