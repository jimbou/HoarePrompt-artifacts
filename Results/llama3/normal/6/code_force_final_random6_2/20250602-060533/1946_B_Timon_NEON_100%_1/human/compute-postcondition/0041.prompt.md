Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: arr is a list of integers, new_segment is an empty list, max_segment is a list containing two zeros, segments_variants is an empty list, max_sum is -1
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(arr)):
    if new_segment:
        if arr[i] < 0:
            if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]:
                segments_variants.append(max_segment + [i - 1])
            else:
                segments_variants.append(new_segment + [i - 1])
                max_segment = new_segment
            new_segment = []
            max_segment[0] += arr[i]
        else:
            max_segment[0] += arr[i]
            new_segment[0] += arr[i]
    else:
        if arr[i] >= 0:
            new_segment = [arr[i], i]
        max_segment[0] += arr[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *arr is a list of integers that is not empty, new_segment is a list containing at least one integer, max_segment is a list containing at least one integer, segments_variants is a list containing one element which is either max_segment + [i - 1] if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0] or new_segment + [i - 1] if max_segment[0] <= new_segment[0], max_sum is -1, and the current value of i is 0. If arr[i] is less than 0, new_segment is an empty list and max_segment's first element is incremented by the value of arr[i]. If arr[i] is not less than 0, new_segment is a list containing at least one integer equal to its original value plus the value at index i in arr, max_segment is a list containing two integers, the first integer is equal to the value at index i in arr, the second integer is 0. If new_segment is empty, then new_segment is a list containing the current value of arr[i] and i if arr[i] is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise new_segment is empty, max_segment is a list containing arr[0] and 0, segments_variants is an empty list, max_sum is -1, and i is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *arr is a list of integers that is not empty, new_segment is a list containing at least one integer, max_segment is a list containing at least one integer, segments_variants is a list containing one or two elements which are either max_segment + [i - 1] if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0] or new_segment + [i - 1] if max_segment[0] <= new_segment[0], max_sum is -1, and the current value of i is 1. If new_segment is not empty, then if arr[i] < 0, new_segment is an empty list, max_segment's first element is incremented by the value of arr[i], and segments_variants contains two elements. Otherwise, new_segment's first element is incremented by arr[1], max_segment's first element is incremented by arr[1], and segments_variants contains one element. If new_segment is empty, then max_segment's first element is updated to max_segment[0] + arr[1], and if arr[i] >= 0, then new_segment is set to [arr[1], 1].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *arr is a list of integers that is not empty and has at least 2 elements, new_segment is a list containing at least one integer, max_segment is a list containing at least one integer, segments_variants is a list containing one or two elements which are either max_segment + [i - 1] if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0] or new_segment + [i - 1] if max_segment[0] <= new_segment[0], max_sum is -1, and the current value of i is 2. If new_segment is not empty, then if arr[i] < 0, new_segment is an empty list, max_segment's first element is incremented by arr[i]. Otherwise, new_segment's first element is incremented by arr[2], max_segment's first element is incremented by arr[2]. If new_segment is empty, then new_segment is a list containing arr[2] and 2, and segments_variants is a list containing one or two elements which are either max_segment + [i - 1] if max_segment[0] > arr[2] or arr[2] + [2 - 1] if max_segment[0] <= arr[2], and max_segment[0] is either max_segment[0] + arr[2] (if max_segment[0] > arr[2]) or arr[2] + arr[2] (if max_segment[0] <= arr[2]).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
