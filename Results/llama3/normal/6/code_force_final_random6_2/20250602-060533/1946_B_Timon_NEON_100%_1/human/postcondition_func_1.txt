This function takes a list of integers as input and returns the segment with the maximum sum of consecutive positive integers and the index of the last element of the maximum sum. It iterates through the list, tracking the maximum sum of consecutive positive integers and the corresponding segment. If a negative number is encountered, it checks if the current segment has a higher sum than the maximum segment found so far and updates the maximum segment if necessary. Finally, it returns the segment with the maximum sum and the index of the last element of the maximum sum.
