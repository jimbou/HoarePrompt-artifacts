Postcondition: ***arr is a list of integers that is not empty and has at least 2 elements, new_segment is a list containing at least one integer, max_segment is a list containing at least one integer. If max_segment[0] > new_segment[0], segments_variants is a list containing three elements which are max_segment + [i - 1]. Otherwise, max_segment is equal to new_segment and segments_variants is a list containing two or three elements which are new_segment + [i - 1]. max_sum is -1, and the current value of i is 2.***
