Output State: **arr is a list of integers that is not empty, new_segment is a list containing at least one integer, max_segment is a list containing at least one integer, segments_variants is a list containing two elements which are either max_segment + [i - 1] if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0] or new_segment + [i - 1] if max_segment[0] <= new_segment[0], and max_segment + [i - 1], max_sum is -1, and the current value of i is 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of integers `arr` remains unchanged and is not empty. The list `new_segment` and `max_segment` also remain unchanged and contain at least one integer. The list `segments_variants` now contains two elements: the first element is either `max_segment + [i - 1]` if the first element of `max_segment` is greater than the first element of `new_segment`, or `new_segment + [i - 1]` if the first element of `max_segment` is less than or equal to the first element of `new_segment`. The second element of `segments_variants` is `max_segment + [i - 1]`. The value of `max_sum` remains -1, and the current value of `i` is still 1.
