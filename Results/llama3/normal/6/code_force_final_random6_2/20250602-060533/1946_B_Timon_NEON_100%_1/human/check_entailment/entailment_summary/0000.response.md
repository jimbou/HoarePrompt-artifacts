Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing k operations, where each operation involves inserting the sum of a contiguous subarray anywhere in the array. The program consists of three functions: func_1, func_2, and func_3.

Function func_1 takes an integer as input and returns the remainder of the number divided by 1000000007, which is used to handle large numbers and prevent overflow.

Function func_2 takes a list of integers as input and returns a list containing the maximum sum of a subarray and the index of the first element of that subarray. The function identifies the maximum sum of a subarray by considering all possible segments in the input list, where a segment is a contiguous subarray with more than one element.

The main program reads the input, calls func_2 to find the maximum sum of a subarray, and then calculates the maximum possible sum of the array after k operations using the formula: max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]. Finally, it calls func_1 to handle the large number and prints the result.

The program correctly implements the problem's requirements and uses the functions to achieve the desired result. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
