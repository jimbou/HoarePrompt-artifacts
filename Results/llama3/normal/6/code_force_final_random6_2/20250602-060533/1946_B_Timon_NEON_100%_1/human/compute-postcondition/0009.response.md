Output State: **arr is a list of integers that is not empty, new_segment is an empty list, max_segment is a list containing at least one integer with its first element incremented by the value of arr[i], segments_variants is a list containing one element which is either max_segment + [i - 1] if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0] or new_segment + [i - 1] if max_segment[0] <= new_segment[0], max_sum is -1, and the current value of i is 0. The current value of arr[i] is less than 0.**

The code first resets the new_segment list to an empty list. Then, it increments the first element of the max_segment list by the value of arr[i], which is less than 0. This means the first element of max_segment will decrease by a certain amount. The value of i remains unchanged at 0. The segments_variants list still contains one element, which is either max_segment + [i - 1] if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0] or new_segment + [i - 1] if max_segment[0] <= new_segment[0]. Since max_segment[0] has decreased, the condition for segments_variants might change. The max_sum remains unchanged at -1.
