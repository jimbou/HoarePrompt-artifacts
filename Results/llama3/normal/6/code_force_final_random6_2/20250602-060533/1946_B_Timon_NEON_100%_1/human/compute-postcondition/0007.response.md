Output State: **arr is a list of integers that is not empty, new_segment is a list containing at least one integer, max_segment is a list containing at least one integer and is equal to new_segment, segments_variants is a list containing one list which is new_segment + [i - 1], max_sum is -1, and the current value of i is 0. The current value of arr[i] is less than 0.**

The code snippet modifies the state of the program by appending a new list to `segments_variants` and updating the value of `max_segment`. The first line adds a new list to `segments_variants`, which is a combination of `new_segment` and the value of `i - 1`. Since `i` is 0, `i - 1` is -1, so the new list is `new_segment + [-1]`. The second line assigns the value of `new_segment` to `max_segment`, effectively updating `max_segment` to be equal to `new_segment`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
