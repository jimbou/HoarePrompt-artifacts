Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 2, n is an integer, s1 is a string, s2 is a string, a1 is an integer equal to the number of '1' in s1, a2 is an integer equal to the number of '1' in s2, hd is an integer equal to a1 - a2, res is an integer equal to the absolute difference between a1 and a2, i is not defined, and stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if hd > 0:
        hd -= 1
        continue
    if s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0':
        res += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 2, n is an integer greater than 0, s1 is a string, s2 is a string, a1 is an integer equal to the number of '1' in s1, a2 is an integer equal to the number of '1' in s2, res is an integer equal to the absolute difference between a1 and a2 plus 1 if s1[i] is '1' and s2[i] is '0', otherwise res is an integer equal to the absolute difference between a1 and a2, i is 0, and stdin is empty. If the difference between the number of '1' in s1 and s2 is greater than 0, then hd is an integer equal to a1 - a2 - 1. Otherwise, hd remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 2, n is an integer greater than 1, s1 is a string, s2 is a string, a1 is an integer equal to the number of '1' in s1, a2 is an integer equal to the number of '1' in s2, res is an integer equal to the absolute difference between a1 and a2 plus 2 if s1[i] is '1' and s2[i] is '0', otherwise res is an integer equal to the absolute difference between a1 and a2 plus 1, i is 1, and stdin is empty. If the difference between the number of '1' in s1 and s2 is greater than 0, then hd is an integer equal to a1 - a2 - 1 and if hd > 0 then hd is decreased by 1. Otherwise, hd remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 2, n is an integer greater than 2, s1 is a string, s2 is a string, a1 is an integer equal to the number of '1' in s1, a2 is an integer equal to the number of '1' in s2, res is an integer equal to the absolute difference between a1 and a2 plus 3 if s1[i] is '1' and s2[i] is '0', otherwise res is an integer equal to the absolute difference between a1 and a2 plus 2, i is 2, and stdin is empty. If the difference between the number of '1' in s1 and s2 is greater than 0, then hd is an integer equal to a1 - a2 - 1 if hd is not greater than 0, otherwise hd is an integer equal to a1 - a2 - 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
