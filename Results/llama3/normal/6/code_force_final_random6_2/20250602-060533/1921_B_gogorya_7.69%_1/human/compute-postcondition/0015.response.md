To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer greater than 1.

To adjust the states, we need to increment `i` by 1, so `i` becomes 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `s1` is a string, `s2` is a string, `a1` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in `s1`, `a2` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in `s2`, `hd` is an integer equal to `a1 - a2` if `a1 - a2` is not greater than 0, otherwise `hd` is an integer equal to `a1 - a2 - 1`, `i` is 2, `res` is an integer equal to the absolute difference between `a1` and `a2` plus 1 or 2 depending on the values of `s1` and `s2` at index `i`.**
