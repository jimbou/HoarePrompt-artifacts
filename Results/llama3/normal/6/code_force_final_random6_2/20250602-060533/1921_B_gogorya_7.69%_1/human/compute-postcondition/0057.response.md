Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `s1` is a string, `s2` is a string, `a1` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in `s1`, `a2` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in `s2`, `res` is an integer equal to the absolute difference between `a1` and `a2` plus 2 if `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', otherwise `res` is an integer equal to the absolute difference between `a1` and `a2` plus 1, `i` is 1, and `stdin` is empty. If the difference between the number of '1' in `s1` and `s2` is greater than 0, then `hd` is an integer equal to `a1 - a2 - 1` and if `hd > 0` then `hd` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `hd` remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `res` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `hd` also remain the same.
