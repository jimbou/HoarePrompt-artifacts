Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `s1` is a string, `s2` is a string, `a1` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in `s1`, `a2` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in `s2`, `hd` is an integer equal to `a1 - a2 - 1` if `a1 - a2 > 0`, otherwise `hd` is an integer equal to `a1 - a2`, `res` is an integer equal to the absolute difference between `a1` and `a2` plus 2 if `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', otherwise `res` is an integer equal to the absolute difference between `a1` and `a2` plus 1, `i` is 2, stdin is empty. If `hd` > 0 and `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', then `res` is an integer equal to the absolute difference between `a1` and `a2` plus 3.**
