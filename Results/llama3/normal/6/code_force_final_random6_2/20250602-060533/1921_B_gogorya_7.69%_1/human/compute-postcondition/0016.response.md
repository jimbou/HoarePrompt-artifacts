Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 0, n is an integer greater than 2, s1 is a string, s2 is a string, a1 is an integer equal to the number of '1' in s1, a2 is an integer equal to the number of '1' in s2, hd is an integer equal to a1 - a2 if a1 - a2 is not greater than 0, otherwise hd is an integer equal to a1 - a2 - 1, i is 2, res is an integer equal to the absolute difference between a1 and a2 plus 1 or 2 depending on the values of s1 and s2 at index i, hd is decreased by 1.**

The code snippet provided consists of two lines: `hd -= 1` and `continue`. The first line decreases the value of `hd` by 1. The second line, `continue`, is a control flow statement that skips the rest of the code inside a loop and moves on to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop provided in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not have any effect in this context.

Therefore, the only change in the output state is the decrease of `hd` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
