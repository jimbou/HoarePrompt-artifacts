This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the result for each case. It calculates the absolute difference between the number of '1's in two input strings and then increments this difference by the number of positions where the first string has '1' and the second string has '0', but only if the difference is not already positive. The function repeats this process for each test case and prints the final result for each case.
