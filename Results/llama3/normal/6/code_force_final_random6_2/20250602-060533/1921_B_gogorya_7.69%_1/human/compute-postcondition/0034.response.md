Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `s1` is a string, `s2` is a string, `a1` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in `s1`, `a2` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in `s2`, if `a1 - a2 > 0`, then `hd` is an integer equal to `a1 - a2 - 1`, otherwise `hd` is an integer equal to `a1 - a2`, `res` is an integer equal to the absolute difference between `a1` and `a2` plus 1 if `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', otherwise `res` is an integer equal to the absolute difference between `a1` and `a2`, `i` is 1, stdin is empty**
