Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 1, n is an integer greater than 1, s1 is a string, s2 is a string, a1 is an integer equal to the number of '1' in s1, a2 is an integer equal to the number of '1' in s2, hd is an integer equal to a1 - a2 - 1, res is an integer equal to the absolute difference between a1 and a2 plus 1 if s1[i] is '1' and s2[i] is '0', otherwise res is an integer equal to the absolute difference between a1 and a2, i is 1, stdin is empty**

The code block modifies the value of `hd` by subtracting 1 from its initial value, which was `a1 - a2`. The `continue` statement does not affect any variables. All other variables remain unchanged.
