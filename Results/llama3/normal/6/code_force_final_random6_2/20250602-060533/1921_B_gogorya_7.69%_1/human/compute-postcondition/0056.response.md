Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 2, n is an integer greater than 1, s1 is a string, s2 is a string, a1 is an integer equal to the number of '1' in s1, a2 is an integer equal to the number of '1' in s2, res is an integer equal to the absolute difference between a1 and a2 plus 1 if s1[i] is '1' and s2[i] is '0', otherwise res is an integer equal to the absolute difference between a1 and a2, i is 1, and stdin is empty. If the difference between the number of '1' in s1 and s2 is greater than 0, then hd is an integer equal to a1 - a2 - 1 and if hd > 0 then hd is decreased by 1. Otherwise, hd remains unchanged.***
