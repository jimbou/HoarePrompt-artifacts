The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `s1` is a string, `s2` is a string, `a1` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in `s1`, `a2` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in `s2`, `hd` is an integer equal to `a1 - a2 - min(n-1, a1 - a2)`, `res` is an integer equal to the absolute difference between `a1` and `a2` plus the number of times `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0' for `i` in range(n), `i` is `n-1`, `stdin` is empty, and `res` is printed**
