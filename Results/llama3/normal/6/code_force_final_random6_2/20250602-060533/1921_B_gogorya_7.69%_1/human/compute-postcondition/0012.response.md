Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 0, n is an integer greater than 1, s1 is a string, s2 is a string, a1 is an integer equal to the number of '1' in s1, a2 is an integer equal to the number of '1' in s2, hd is an integer equal to a1 - a2. If hd > 0, then hd is decremented by 1. stdin is empty, i is 1, res is an integer equal to the absolute difference between a1 and a2 plus 1 if the current value of s1 at index i is '1' and the current value of s2 at index i is '0', otherwise res is an integer equal to the absolute difference between a1 and a2***
