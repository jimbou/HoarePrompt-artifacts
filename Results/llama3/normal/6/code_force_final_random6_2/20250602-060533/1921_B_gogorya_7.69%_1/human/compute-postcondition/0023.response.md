To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects within it.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 0, and `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive).

For the loop to execute again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `t` remains the same.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `_` is 1
* `t` is still an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive)

The other variables, such as `n`, `s1`, `s2`, `a1`, `a2`, `hd`, `res`, `stdin`, and `i`, are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `s1` is a string, `s2` is a string, `a1` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in `s1`, `a2` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in `s2`, `hd` is an integer equal to `a1` - `a2`, `res` is an integer equal to the absolute difference between `a1` and `a2` plus the number of indices `i` where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', `stdin` is empty, `i` is `n-1`**
