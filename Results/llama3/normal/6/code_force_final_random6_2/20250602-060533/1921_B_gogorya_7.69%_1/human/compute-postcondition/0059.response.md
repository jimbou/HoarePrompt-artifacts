To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer greater than 1.

To adjust the states, we need to increment `i` by 1, so `i` becomes 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

The other variables, such as `t`, `_`, `s1`, `s2`, `a1`, `a2`, `res`, `hd`, and `stdin`, are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `s1` is a string, `s2` is a string, `a1` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in `s1`, `a2` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in `s2`, `res` is an integer equal to the absolute difference between `a1` and `a2` plus 2 if `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', otherwise `res` is an integer equal to the absolute difference between `a1` and `a2` plus 1, `i` is 2, and `stdin` is empty. If the difference between the number of '1' in `s1` and `s2` is greater than 0, then `hd` is an integer equal to `a1 - a2 - 1` and if `hd > 0` then `hd` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `hd` remains unchanged.**
