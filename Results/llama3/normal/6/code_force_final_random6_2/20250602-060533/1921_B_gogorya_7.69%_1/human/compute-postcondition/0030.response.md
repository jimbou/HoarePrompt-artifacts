Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `s1` is a string, `s2` is a string, `a1` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in `s1`, `a2` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in `s2`, `hd` is an integer equal to `a1 - a2`, `res` is an integer equal to the absolute difference between `a1` and `a2` plus 1, `i` is 0, stdin is empty, the current value of `s1[i]` is '1' and the current value of `s2[i]` is '0'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `res` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `res` now represents the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, plus 1. All other variables retain their original values and properties.
