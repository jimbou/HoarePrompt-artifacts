Output: **t is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 2, n is an integer, s1 is a string, s2 is a string, a1 is an integer equal to the number of '1' in s1, a2 is an integer equal to the number of '1' in s2, res is an integer equal to the absolute difference between a1 and a2 plus the number of iterations where s1[i] is '1' and s2[i] is '0', i is n-1, and stdin is empty. If the difference between the number of '1' in s1 and s2 is greater than 0, then hd is an integer equal to a1 - a2 - min(n, a1 - a2). Otherwise, hd remains unchanged, and res is printed, where res is the absolute difference between a1 and a2 plus the number of iterations where s1[i] is '1' and s2[i] is '0'**
