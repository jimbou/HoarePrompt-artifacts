Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5), the second line contains a string s of n characters ('0' or '1'), and the third line contains a string f of n characters ('0' or '1').**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The stdin still contains the t test cases, each consisting of three lines as described. The values of the other variables are not affected.
