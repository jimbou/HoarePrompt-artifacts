Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 0, n is an integer, s1 is a string, s2 is a string, a1 is an integer equal to the number of '1' in s1, a2 is an integer equal to the number of '1' in s2, hd is an integer equal to a1 - a2, res is an integer equal to the absolute difference between a1 and a2 plus the number of indices i where s1[i] is '1' and s2[i] is '0', stdin is empty, i is n-1.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` remains unchanged, `_` is still 0, `n` is the same integer, `s1` and `s2` are the same strings, `a1` and `a2` are still the counts of '1's in `s1` and `s2` respectively, `hd` is the difference between `a1` and `a2`, and `res` is the absolute difference between `a1` and `a2` plus the number of indices `i` where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0'. The loop counter `i` has reached `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
