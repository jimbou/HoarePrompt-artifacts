The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `s1` is a string, `s2` is a string, `a1` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in `s1`, `a2` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in `s2`, `res` is an integer equal to the absolute difference between `a1` and `a2` plus 1 if `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', otherwise `res` is an integer equal to the absolute difference between `a1` and `a2`, `i` is 1, and `stdin` is empty. If the difference between the number of '1' in `s1` and `s2` is greater than 0, then `hd` is an integer equal to `a1 - a2 - 1`. Otherwise, `hd` remains unchanged.**
