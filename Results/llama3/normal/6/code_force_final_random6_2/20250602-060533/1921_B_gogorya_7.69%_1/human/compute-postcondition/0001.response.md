To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t` and the loop variable `_` (which is a throwaway variable, but we'll consider its state as the iteration number). The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 0**
