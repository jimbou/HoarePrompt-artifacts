Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 0, n is an integer, s1 is a string, s2 is a string, a1 is an integer equal to the number of '1' in s1, a2 is an integer equal to the number of '1' in s2, hd is an integer equal to a1 - a2, res is an integer equal to the absolute difference between a1 and a2, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if hd > 0:
        hd -= 1
        continue
    if s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0':
        res += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 0, n is an integer greater than 0, s1 is a string, s2 is a string, a1 is an integer equal to the number of '1' in s1, a2 is an integer equal to the number of '1' in s2, hd is an integer equal to a1 - a2, stdin is empty, i is 0. If the current value of s1 at index i is '1' and the current value of s2 at index i is '0', then res is an integer equal to the absolute difference between a1 and a2 plus 1. Otherwise, res remains an integer equal to the absolute difference between a1 and a2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `s1` is a string, `s2` is a string, `a1` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in `s1`, `a2` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in `s2`, `hd` is an integer equal to `a1 - a2` if `a1 - a2` is not greater than 0, otherwise `hd` is an integer equal to `a1 - a2 - 1`, `i` is 1. If the current value of `s1` at index `i` is '1' and the current value of `s2` at index `i` is '0', then `res` is an integer equal to the absolute difference between `a1` and `a2` plus 2. Otherwise, `res` is an integer equal to the absolute difference between `a1` and `a2` plus 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `s1` is a string, `s2` is a string, `a1` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in `s1`, `a2` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in `s2`, `hd` is an integer equal to `a1 - a2` if `a1 - a2` is not greater than 0, otherwise `hd` is an integer equal to `a1 - a2 - 1`, `i` is 2, `res` is an integer equal to the absolute difference between `a1` and `a2` plus 1 or 2 depending on the values of `s1` and `s2` at index `i`. If `hd` is greater than 0 and `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', `hd` is decreased by 1 and `res` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
