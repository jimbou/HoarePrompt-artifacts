Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `s1` is a string, `s2` is a string, `a1` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in `s1`, `a2` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in `s2`, `hd` is an integer equal to `a1 - a2` if `a1 - a2` is not greater than 0, otherwise `hd` is an integer equal to `a1 - a2 - 1`, `i` is 2, `res` is an integer equal to the absolute difference between `a1` and `a2` plus 1 or 2 depending on the values of `s1` and `s2` at index `i`. If `hd` is greater than 0 and `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', `hd` is decreased by 1 and `res` is increased by 1.**
