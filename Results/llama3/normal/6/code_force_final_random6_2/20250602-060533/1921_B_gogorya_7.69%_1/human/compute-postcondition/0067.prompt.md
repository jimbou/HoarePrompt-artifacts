Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5), the second line contains a string s of n characters ('0' or '1'), and the third line contains a string f of n characters ('0' or '1').
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s1 = input()
    s2 = input()
    a1 = s1.count('1')
    a2 = s2.count('1')
    hd = a1 - a2
    res = abs(a1 - a2)
    for i in range(n):
        if hd > 0:
            hd -= 1
            continue
        if s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0':
            res += 1
    print(res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 0, n is an integer, s1 is a string, s2 is a string, a1 is an integer equal to the number of '1' in s1, a2 is an integer equal to the number of '1' in s2, hd is an integer equal to a1 - a2, res is an integer equal to the absolute difference between a1 and a2 plus the number of indices i where s1[i] is '1' and s2[i] is '0', stdin is empty, i is n-1, and the value of res is being printed which is the absolute difference between a1 and a2 plus the number of indices i where s1[i] is '1' and s2[i] is '0'

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 1, n is an integer, s1 is a string, s2 is a string, a1 is an integer equal to the number of '1' in s1, a2 is an integer equal to the number of '1' in s2, hd is an integer equal to a1 - a2 - min(n-1, a1 - a2), res is an integer equal to the absolute difference between a1 and a2 plus the number of times s1[i] is '1' and s2[i] is '0' for i in range(n), i is n-1, stdin is empty, and res is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 2, n is an integer, s1 is a string, s2 is a string, a1 is an integer equal to the number of '1' in s1, a2 is an integer equal to the number of '1' in s2, res is an integer equal to the absolute difference between a1 and a2 plus the number of iterations where s1[i] is '1' and s2[i] is '0', i is n-1, and stdin is empty. If the difference between the number of '1' in s1 and s2 is greater than 0, then hd is an integer equal to a1 - a2 - min(n, a1 - a2). Otherwise, hd remains unchanged, and res is printed, where res is the absolute difference between a1 and a2 plus the number of iterations where s1[i] is '1' and s2[i] is '0'




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
