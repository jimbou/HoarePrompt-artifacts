Postcondition: ***`T` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases. If `a` is 1, 'Alice' is printed. If `a` is not 1, then if `b` is 1, 'Bob' is printed. If `b` is not 1, then if `a` is odd, 'Bob' is printed. If `a` is even, then if `b` is odd, 'Alice' is printed. Otherwise, if `a` is greater than `b`, 'Bob' is printed. Otherwise, 'Alice' is printed.***
