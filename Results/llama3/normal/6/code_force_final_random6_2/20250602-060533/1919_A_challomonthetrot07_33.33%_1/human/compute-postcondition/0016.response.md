Based on the given initial state, the code snippet `print('Bob')` will print the string 'Bob' as is, without any modifications or dependencies on the variables `T`, `i`, `a`, `b`, or the contents of stdin.

The variables `T`, `i`, `a`, and `b` are not used in the print statement, and the condition that `a` is not equal to `b` does not affect the output. The presence of multiple test cases minus two test cases in stdin also does not impact the output.

Therefore, the output will be a simple string:

Output: **Bob**
