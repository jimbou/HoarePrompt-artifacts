Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine the winner of the game in all cases. The issue lies in the fact that the program only checks for specific conditions and does not consider all possible scenarios.

For example, when `a` and `b` are both even, the program prints 'Bob' if `a > b` and 'Alice' otherwise. However, this is not correct. The correct approach is to consider the parity of the sum `a + b`. If the sum is even, Alice will win; otherwise, Bob will win.

A correct implementation would be to check the parity of the sum `a + b` and print 'Alice' if it's even, and 'Bob' otherwise. The corrected code would be:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')
```

This corrected code correctly determines the winner of the game in all cases.
