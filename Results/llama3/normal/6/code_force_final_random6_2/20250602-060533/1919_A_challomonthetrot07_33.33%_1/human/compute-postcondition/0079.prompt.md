Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains two space-separated integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(T):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if a == b:
        print('Bob')
    elif a == 1:
        print('Alice')
    elif b == 1:
        print('Bob')
    elif a % 2 == 1:
        print('Bob')
    elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:
        print('Alice')
    elif a > b:
        print('Bob')
    else:
        print('Alice')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`T` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases. If `a` equals `b`, 'Bob' is being printed. If `a` is not equal to `b`, then if `a` is 1, 'Alice' is being printed. If `a` is not 1, then if `b` is 1, 'Bob' is being printed. If `b` is not 1, then if `a` is odd, 'Bob' is being printed. If `a` is even, then if `b` is odd, 'Alice' is being printed. Otherwise, if `a` is greater than `b`, 'Bob' is being printed. Otherwise, 'Alice' is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`T` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases. If `a` equals `b`, 'Bob' is printed. If `a` is not equal to `b`, then if `a` is 1, 'Alice' is printed. If `a` is not 1, then if `b` is 1, 'Bob' is printed. If `b` is not 1, then if `a` is odd, 'Bob' is printed. If `a` is even, then if `b` is odd, 'Alice' is printed. Otherwise, if `a` is greater than `b`, 'Bob' is printed. Otherwise, 'Alice' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`T` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases. If `a` is equal to `b`, 'Bob' is printed. If `a` is not equal to `b`, then if `a` is 1, 'Alice' is printed. If `a` is not 1, then if `b` is 1, 'Bob' is printed. If `b` is not 1, then if `a` is odd, 'Bob' is printed. If `a` is even, then if `b` is odd, 'Alice' is printed. Otherwise, if `a` is greater than `b`, 'Bob' is printed. Otherwise, 'Alice' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
