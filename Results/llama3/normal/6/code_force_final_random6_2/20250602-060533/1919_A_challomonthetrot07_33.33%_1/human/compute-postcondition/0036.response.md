Output State: **`T` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.**

In this output state, the values of `T` and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `b` are updated to be integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, which are read from the input. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, as two test cases have been read and processed.
