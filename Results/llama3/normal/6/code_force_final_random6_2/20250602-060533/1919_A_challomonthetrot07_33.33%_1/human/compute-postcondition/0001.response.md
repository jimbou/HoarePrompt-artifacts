According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T` and `i`. If `T` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `T` is a positive integer does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `T` is at least 1 and `i` is now 0.
State: **`T` is at least 1, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains two space-separated integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9).**
