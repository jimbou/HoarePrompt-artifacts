Output State: **`T` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains two space-separated integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9).**

In this output state, `T` is assigned the value of the first test case from the input, which is a positive integer. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus one test case, as one test case has been read and assigned to `T`. Each remaining test case still contains two space-separated integers a and b, with values between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive).
