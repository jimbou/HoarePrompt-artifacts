Output State: **`T` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases.**

In this output state, the values of `T` and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `b` are updated to be integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, which are read from the input. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus four test cases, as one test case has been read and processed.
