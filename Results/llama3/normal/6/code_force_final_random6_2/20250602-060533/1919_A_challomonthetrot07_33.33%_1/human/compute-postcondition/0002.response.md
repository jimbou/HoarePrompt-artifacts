Output State: **`T` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.**

In this output state, the values of `T` and `i` remain unchanged. The variables `a` and `b` are assigned the values of the two space-separated integers from the input, which are between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, as one test case has been read and processed.
