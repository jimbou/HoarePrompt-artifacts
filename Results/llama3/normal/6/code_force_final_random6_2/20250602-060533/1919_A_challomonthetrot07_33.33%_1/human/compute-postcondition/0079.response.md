Output State: **`T` is at least `T`, `i` is `T-1`, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `T+1` test cases. If `a` equals `b`, 'Bob' is printed. If `a` is not equal to `b`, then if `a` is 1, 'Alice' is printed. If `a` is not 1, then if `b` is 1, 'Bob' is printed. If `b` is not 1, then if `a` is odd, 'Bob' is printed. If `a` is even, then if `b` is odd, 'Alice' is printed. Otherwise, if `a` is greater than `b`, 'Bob' is printed. Otherwise, 'Alice' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing `T` times, and the values of `a` and `b` are still integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. The loop has consumed `T+1` test cases from the input, leaving multiple test cases minus `T+1` test cases remaining in the input. The output is determined by the same conditions as before, depending on the values of `a` and `b`.
