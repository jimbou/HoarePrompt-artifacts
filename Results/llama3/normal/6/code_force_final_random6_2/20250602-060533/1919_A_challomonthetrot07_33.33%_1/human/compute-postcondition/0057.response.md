To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for i in range(T):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `T`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `T` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `T` needs to be greater than the new value of `i`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`T` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.**
