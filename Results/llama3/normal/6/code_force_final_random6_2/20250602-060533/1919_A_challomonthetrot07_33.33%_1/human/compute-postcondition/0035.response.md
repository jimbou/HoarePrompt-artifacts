To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `T`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `T`. If `i` is less than `T`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `T` is at least 1.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 1. Since `T` is at least 1, it must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`T` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.**
