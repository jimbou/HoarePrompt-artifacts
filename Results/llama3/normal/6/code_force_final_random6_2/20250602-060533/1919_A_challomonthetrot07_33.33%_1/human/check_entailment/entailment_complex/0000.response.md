Reasoning:

The given program is correct. The rules for determining the winner of the game are correctly implemented in the program. The program checks for the following conditions in order:

1. If a equals b, the winner is 'Bob'.
2. If a is 1, the winner is 'Alice'.
3. If b is 1, the winner is 'Bob'.
4. If a is odd, the winner is 'Bob'.
5. If a is even and b is odd, the winner is 'Alice'.
6. If a is greater than b, the winner is 'Bob'.
7. Otherwise, the winner is 'Alice'.

These conditions are based on the optimal strategy for the game, which is to try to make the opponent have an odd number of coins in their wallet. If a player has an odd number of coins, they can always make a move that leaves their opponent with an even number of coins, forcing their opponent to make a move that leaves them with an odd number of coins, and so on. This continues until one player has no coins left, at which point the other player wins.

The program correctly implements this strategy and prints the winner of the game based on the values of a and b.

Correctness: **True**
