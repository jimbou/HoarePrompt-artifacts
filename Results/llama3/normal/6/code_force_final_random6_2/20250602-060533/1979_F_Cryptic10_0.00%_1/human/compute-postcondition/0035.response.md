Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `d` equals `n-2`, `v` and `u` are the return values of `func_1(n-2)`, `remaining_vertices` is not empty, and if the previous `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, then the previous `v` is in `path` and not in `remaining_vertices`. If `v` equals 0, the rest of the current iteration of the loop is skipped and the next iteration is executed. Otherwise, the execution of the loop continues.***
