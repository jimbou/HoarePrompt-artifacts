Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `d` is within the range of `n - 3` to `-1`, `v` is the first return value of `func_1(d)`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(d)`, and `path` contains all the `v` values that were in `remaining_vertices` during the loop execution. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, then `v` is removed from `remaining_vertices` and appended to `path`. Otherwise, `remaining_vertices` and `path` remain unchanged. If `v` is 0, we skip the rest of the current iteration and move on to the next iteration of the loop.***
