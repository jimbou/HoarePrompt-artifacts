Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `d` is `n-1`, `path` is an empty list, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), `v` and `u` are the return values of `func_1(d)`**.

In this output state, the values of `n`, `d`, `path`, and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged. The code only assigns the return values of `func_1(d)` to `v` and `u`, without modifying any other variables. The specific values of `v` and `u` depend on the implementation of `func_1(d)`, which is not provided.
