Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `d` is `n-2`, `v` and `u` are the return values of `func_1(d)`, if `v` is in the set `remaining_vertices`, then `path` is a list containing `v`, and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) excluding `v`. Otherwise, the values of `path` and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. The values of `n`, `d`, `v`, `u`, `path`, and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged.
