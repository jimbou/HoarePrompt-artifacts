Output State: **n is greater than 0, d is within the range of n - 2 to -2, v is the first return value of func_1(d), u is the second return value of func_1(d), remaining_vertices does not contain v, and path contains all the v values that were in remaining_vertices during the loop execution, including the current value of v if v is in remaining_vertices. v is removed from remaining_vertices and appended to path.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains greater than 0, and the value of `d` remains within the range of `n - 2` to `-2`. The values of `v` and `u` are still the return values of `func_1(d)`. The `remaining_vertices` list no longer contains `v`, and the `path` list now includes the current value of `v` if it was in `remaining_vertices`. The loop breaks after executing these lines, so no further changes occur.
