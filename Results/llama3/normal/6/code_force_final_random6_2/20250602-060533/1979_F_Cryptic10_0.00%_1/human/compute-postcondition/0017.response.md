Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `d` is `n-3`, `v` and `u` are the return values of `func_1(n-3)`. If `v` is in the set `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not equal to 0, then `path` is a list containing `v`, and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) excluding `v`. Otherwise, the values of `path` and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `d` remain the same as in the initial state. The values of `v` and `u` are updated to be the return values of `func_1(n-3)`. The values of `path` and `remaining_vertices` are updated based on the value of `v`. If `v` is in the set `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not equal to 0, then `path` is a list containing `v`, and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) excluding `v`. Otherwise, the values of `path` and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged.
