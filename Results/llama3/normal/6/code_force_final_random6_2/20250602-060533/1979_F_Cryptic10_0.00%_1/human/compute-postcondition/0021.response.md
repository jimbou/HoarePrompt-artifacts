Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `d` is `n-3`, `v` and `u` are the return values of `func_1(n-3)`. If `v` is in the set `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not equal to 0, then `path` is a list containing `v`, and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) excluding `v`. Otherwise, the values of `path` and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged.***
