Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `d` is within the range of `n - 2` to `-2`, `v` is the first return value of `func_1(d)`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(d)`, `remaining_vertices` does not contain `v`, and `path` contains all the `v` values that were in `remaining_vertices` during the loop execution, including the current value of `v` if `v` is in `remaining_vertices`.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `d` remain unchanged. The value of `u` is updated to be the second return value of `func_1(d)`, and a new variable `v` is introduced, which is the first return value of `func_1(d)`. The state of `remaining_vertices` and `path` remains the same as in the initial state.
