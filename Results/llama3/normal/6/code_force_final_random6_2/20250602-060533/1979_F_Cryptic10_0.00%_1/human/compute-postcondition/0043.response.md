Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `d` is -2, `v` and `u` are the return values of func_1(-2). If `v` is in remaining_vertices, then path contains the previous `v`, remaining_vertices does not contain the previous `v` and is not empty. Otherwise, the loop continues with the current values of `n`, `d`, `v`, and `u`.***
