To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `d` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0 and `d` is within the range of `n - 1` to `-1` (inclusive).

Since `n` is already greater than 0, we don't need to adjust its state. However, we need to adjust the state of `d` to ensure it is within the valid range. Since `d` equals -1, we can adjust its state to be within the range of `n - 1` to `-1`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `d` is within the range of `n - 1` to `-1`, `v` and `u` are the return values of `func_1(-1)`, `remaining_vertices` is not empty, `path` contains all the `v` values that were in `remaining_vertices` during the loop execution, and `remaining_vertices` does not contain any of the `v` values that were added to `path`.**
