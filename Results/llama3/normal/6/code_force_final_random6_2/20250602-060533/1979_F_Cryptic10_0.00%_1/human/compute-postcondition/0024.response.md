According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is greater than 0, `d` is -1, `v` and `u` are the return values of `func_1(-1)`, `remaining_vertices` is not empty does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `d` is `n-1`. 
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `d` is `n-1`, `v` and `u` are the return values of `func_1(-1)`, `remaining_vertices` is not empty**
