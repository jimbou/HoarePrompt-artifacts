The code prints a string that starts with an exclamation mark (!) followed by a space, and then the string representation of all integers in the `path` list, separated by spaces.
Since `path` contains all the integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) in the order they were removed from `remaining_vertices`, the output will be a string that lists these integers in the order they were removed.
Output: **! 1 2 3 ... n (where n is the number of vertices and the integers are listed in the order they were removed from remaining_vertices)**
