Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `d` is within the range of `n - 2` to `-2`, `v` is the first return value of `func_1(d)`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(d)`, `remaining_vertices` does not contain `v`, and `path` contains all the `v` values that were in `remaining_vertices` during the loop execution, including the current value of `v` if `v` is in `remaining_vertices`. If `v` is 0, the loop skips to the next iteration. Otherwise, the loop continues with the current values of `n`, `d`, `v`, `u`, `remaining_vertices`, and `path`.***
