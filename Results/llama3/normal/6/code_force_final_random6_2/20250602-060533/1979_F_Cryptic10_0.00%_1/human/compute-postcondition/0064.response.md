Output State: **n is greater than 0, d is within the range of n - 3 to -1, v is the first return value of func_1(d), u is the second return value of func_1(d), path contains all the v values that were in remaining_vertices during the loop execution, and v is removed from remaining_vertices and appended to path.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `d` also remains within the specified range as it is not affected by the code. The values of `v` and `u` are still the return values of `func_1(d)`, as the code does not modify them. The `path` variable now contains the value of `v` that was in `remaining_vertices` during the loop execution, and `v` is removed from `remaining_vertices`. If `v` is 0, the rest of the current iteration is skipped, and the loop moves on to the next iteration.
