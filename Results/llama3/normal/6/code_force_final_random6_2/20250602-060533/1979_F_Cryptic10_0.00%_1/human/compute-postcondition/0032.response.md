To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for d in range(n - 1, -1, -1):`. This means that the loop will iterate from `n-1` down to `-1` with a step of `-1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `d` is `n-1`. For the loop to execute again, `d` needs to be decremented by 1, so `d` becomes `n-2`.

The other variables in the loop head are `n`, which remains unchanged, and the range object, which is not a variable that can be adjusted.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `d`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `d` equals `n-2`, `v` and `u` are the return values of `func_1(n-1)`, and `remaining_vertices` is not empty. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, then `v` is added to `path` and removed from `remaining_vertices`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `path` and `remaining_vertices`.**
