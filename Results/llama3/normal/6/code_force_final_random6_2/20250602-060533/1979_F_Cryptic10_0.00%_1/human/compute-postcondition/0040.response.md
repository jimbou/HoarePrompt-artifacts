The code snippet `continue` skips the rest of the code inside the loop and moves to the next iteration. Since there are no assignments or modifications to the variables in the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `d` is -2, `v` and `u` are the return values of func_1(-2), if v is in remaining_vertices, then path contains the previous v, remaining_vertices does not contain the previous v and is not empty, and we move to the next iteration of the loop.**
