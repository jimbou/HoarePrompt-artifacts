To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition that must be met for the loop to execute. The loop condition is `while remaining_vertices:`, which means the loop will execute as long as `remaining_vertices` is not empty.

Given the state right before the loop:

- `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2.
- `path` is an empty list.
- `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

Since the loop's execution depends solely on `remaining_vertices` not being empty, and it is already stated that `remaining_vertices` contains integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) with `n` being at least 2, there is no need to adjust the state of `remaining_vertices` because it is guaranteed to not be empty. The states of `n` and `path` do not affect the loop's condition directly, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state right before the loop does not need any adjustments to ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `path` is an empty list, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive)**
