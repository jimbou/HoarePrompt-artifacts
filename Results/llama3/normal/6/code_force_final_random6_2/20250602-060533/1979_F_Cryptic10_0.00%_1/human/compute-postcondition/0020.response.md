Output State: **n is greater than 0, d is n-3, v and u are the return values of func_1(n-3), path is a list containing v, and remaining_vertices is a set containing integers from 1 to n (inclusive) excluding v.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `d` also remains the same, which is `n-3`. The values of `v` and `u` are still the return values of `func_1(n-3)`. 

The list `path` now contains the value `v` appended to it. The set `remaining_vertices` has been modified to exclude the value `v`. This means that `remaining_vertices` now contains all integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), except for the value `v`.
