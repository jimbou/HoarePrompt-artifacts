Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `d` is -1, `v` and `u` are the return values of `func_1(-1)`. If `v` is in the set `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not equal to 0, then `path` is a list containing `v`, and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) excluding `v`. Otherwise, the values of `path` and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations means that the loop has finished iterating over all values of `d` from `n-1` to `-1`. The value of `d` is now `-1`, and `v` and `u` are the return values of `func_1(-1)`. If `v` is in the set `remaining_vertices` and is not equal to 0, then `path` contains `v` and `remaining_vertices` does not contain `v`. Otherwise, `path` and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged.
