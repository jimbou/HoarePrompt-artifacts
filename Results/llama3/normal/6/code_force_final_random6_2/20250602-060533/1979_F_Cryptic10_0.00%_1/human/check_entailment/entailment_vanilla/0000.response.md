Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding a Hamiltonian path in a graph by interacting with the grader. The program uses two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` takes a degree `d` as input and sends a query to the grader in the format "? d". It then reads the response from the grader, which consists of two integers `v` and `u`, and returns them as a tuple.

`func_2` takes the number of vertices `n` as input and uses `func_1` to interact with the grader. It maintains a set of remaining vertices and iterates over the degrees from `n-1` to `0`. For each degree `d`, it calls `func_1` and checks if the returned vertex `v` is in the set of remaining vertices. If it is, it adds `v` to the path and removes it from the set of remaining vertices. This process continues until all vertices have been added to the path.

The program then prints the path in the format "! v_1 v_2 ... v_n" and flushes the output buffer.

Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the strategy for finding a Hamiltonian path in the graph. It uses the grader's responses to identify the vertices with the minimum degree and adds them to the path in the correct order. The program also handles the case where a vertex is not connected to any other vertex by removing it from the set of remaining vertices.

The program's use of the `sys.stdout.flush()` function ensures that the output is sent to the grader immediately, which is necessary for interactive problems.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the correct output for the given problem.
