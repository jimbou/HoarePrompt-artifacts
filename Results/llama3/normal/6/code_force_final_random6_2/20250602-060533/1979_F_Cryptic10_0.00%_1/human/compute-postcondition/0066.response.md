Output State: **`d` equals -1, `v` and `u` are the return values of `func_1(-1)`, `remaining_vertices` does not contain any of the `v` values that were added to `path`, and `path` contains all the `v` values that were in `remaining_vertices` during the loop execution.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations means that the loop has finished executing, and the variables have reached their final values. The variable `d` has reached its final value of -1, and `v` and `u` are the return values of `func_1(-1)`. The `remaining_vertices` list no longer contains any of the `v` values that were added to the `path` list during the loop execution, and the `path` list contains all the `v` values that were in `remaining_vertices` during the loop execution.
