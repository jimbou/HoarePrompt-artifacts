The only variable in the loop head is `remaining_vertices`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on whether `remaining_vertices` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) excluding `v`. For the loop to execute one more time, `remaining_vertices` must not be empty, which means it must contain at least one element. Since `v` is not equal to 0 and is in the set `remaining_vertices`, we can conclude that `remaining_vertices` must contain at least one element other than `v`. Therefore, the state of `remaining_vertices` needs to be adjusted to ensure it is not empty.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `d` is -1, `v` and `u` are the return values of `func_1(-1)`, `remaining_vertices` is not empty**
