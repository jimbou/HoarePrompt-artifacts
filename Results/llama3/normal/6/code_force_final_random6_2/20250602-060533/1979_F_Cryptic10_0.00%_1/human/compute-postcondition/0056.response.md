Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `d` is within the range of `n - 2` to `-2`, `v` is the first return value of `func_1(d)`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(d)`, `remaining_vertices` does not contain `v`, and `path` contains all the `v` values that were in `remaining_vertices` during the loop execution, including the current value of `v` if `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but we skip to the next iteration of the loop, meaning that the current iteration is skipped and the loop continues with the next iteration.
