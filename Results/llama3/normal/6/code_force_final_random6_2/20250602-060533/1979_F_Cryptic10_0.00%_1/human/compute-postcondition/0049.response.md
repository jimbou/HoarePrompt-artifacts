The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop and moves to the next iteration. Since the current value of `v` is 0, this value will be skipped and the next value from `remaining_vertices` will be considered in the next iteration.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `d` is within the range of `n - 1` to `-1`, `v` and `u` are the return values of `func_1(d)`, `remaining_vertices` is not empty, `path` contains all the `v` values that were in `remaining_vertices` during the loop execution, and `remaining_vertices` does not contain any of the `v` values that were added to `path`. The current value of `v` is skipped and the next value from `remaining_vertices` will be considered in the next iteration.**
