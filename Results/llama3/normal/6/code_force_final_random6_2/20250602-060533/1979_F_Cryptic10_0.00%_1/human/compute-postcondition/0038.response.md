To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for d in range(n - 1, -1, -1):`. This means that the loop will iterate over the values of `d` from `n-1` down to `-1` (exclusive) in steps of `-1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `n` is greater than `0`, `d` equals `n-2`, and the loop has been terminated. This means that the value of `d` has reached `-1`, which is the termination condition of the loop.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the variables in the loop head, which are `d` and `n`.

Since `d` has reached `-1`, we need to decrement it by `-1` to get the next value in the range. Therefore, `d` should be set to `-2`.

The value of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

The other variables, `v`, `u`, `path`, and `remaining_vertices`, are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `d` is -2, `v` and `u` are the return values of func_1(n-2), if v is in remaining_vertices, then path contains the previous v, remaining_vertices does not contain the previous v and is not empty**
