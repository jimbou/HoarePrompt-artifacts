To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `d` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `d` is greater than -1. At the end of the previous iteration, `d` is within the range of `n - 1` to `-1`. To execute the loop again, `d` must be decremented by 1, so `d` is now within the range of `n - 2` to `-2`.

The state of `n` remains unchanged, as it is not modified in the loop head.

The states of `u`, `remaining_vertices`, `path`, and `v` are not modified in the loop head, so they remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `d` is within the range of `n - 2` to `-2`, `u` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `remaining_vertices` does not contain `v`, and `path` contains all the `v` values that were in `remaining_vertices` during the loop execution, including the current value of `v` if `v` is in `remaining_vertices`.**
