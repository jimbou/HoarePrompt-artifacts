Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, path is an empty list, remaining_vertices is a set containing integers from 1 to n (inclusive)
Code of the loop:
while remaining_vertices:
    for d in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        v, u = func_1(d)
        if v == 0:
            continue
        if v in remaining_vertices:
            path.append(v)
            remaining_vertices.remove(v)
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than 0, `d` is -1, `v` and `u` are the return values of `func_1(-1)`. If `v` is in the set `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not equal to 0, then `path` is a list containing `v`, and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) excluding `v`. Otherwise, the values of `path` and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is greater than 0, `d` equals -1, `v` and `u` are the return values of `func_1(-1)`, `remaining_vertices` is not empty, `path` contains all the `v` values that were in `remaining_vertices` during the loop execution, and `remaining_vertices` does not contain any of the `v` values that were added to `path`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `d` equals -1, `v` and `u` are the return values of `func_1(-1)`, `remaining_vertices` does not contain any of the `v` values that were added to `path`, and `path` contains all the `v` values that were in `remaining_vertices` during the loop execution.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
