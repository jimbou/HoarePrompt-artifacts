According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `remaining_vertices`. If `remaining_vertices` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `remaining_vertices` is not empty, so it does not need to be adjusted. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `d` equals -1, `v` and `u` are the return values of `func_1(-1)`, `remaining_vertices` is not empty, `path` contains all the `v` values that were in `remaining_vertices` during the loop execution, and `remaining_vertices` does not contain any of the `v` values that were added to `path`.**
