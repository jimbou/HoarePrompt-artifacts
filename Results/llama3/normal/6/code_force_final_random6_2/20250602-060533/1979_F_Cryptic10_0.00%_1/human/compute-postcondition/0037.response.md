Postcondition: ***n is greater than 0, d equals n-2, v and u are the return values of func_1(n-2), if v is in remaining_vertices, then path contains the previous v, remaining_vertices does not contain the previous v and is not empty, and the loop has been terminated. Otherwise, the execution of the loop continues.***
