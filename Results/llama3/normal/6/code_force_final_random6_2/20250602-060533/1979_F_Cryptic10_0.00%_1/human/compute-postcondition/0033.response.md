Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `d` equals `n-2`, `v` and `u` are the return values of `func_1(n-2)`, `remaining_vertices` is not empty, and if the previous `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, then the previous `v` is in `path` and not in `remaining_vertices`.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `d` remain the same as in the initial state. The values of `v` and `u` are updated to be the return values of `func_1(n-2)`, which is a different function call than in the initial state. The state of `remaining_vertices` is still not empty, but its contents may have changed if the previous `v` was in it and was added to `path`. The state of `path` may have also changed if the previous `v` was added to it.
