Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `d` is within the range of `n - 1` to `-1`, `v` and `u` are the return values of `func_1(d)`, `remaining_vertices` is not empty, `path` contains all the `v` values that were in `remaining_vertices` during the loop execution, and `remaining_vertices` does not contain any of the `v` values that were added to `path`.**

In this output state, the values of `v` and `u` have been updated to be the return values of `func_1(d)`, where `d` is within the range of `n - 1` to `-1`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions regarding `remaining_vertices` and `path` are still valid.
