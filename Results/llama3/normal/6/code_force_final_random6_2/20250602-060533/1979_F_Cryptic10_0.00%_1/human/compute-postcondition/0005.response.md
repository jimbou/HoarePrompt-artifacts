The code snippet is `continue`. This statement skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. It does not terminate the loop entirely. Since the initial state does not mention any loop, we can assume that this `continue` statement is inside a loop that is not shown in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `d` is `n-1`, `path` is an empty list, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), `v` is 0, and `u` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
