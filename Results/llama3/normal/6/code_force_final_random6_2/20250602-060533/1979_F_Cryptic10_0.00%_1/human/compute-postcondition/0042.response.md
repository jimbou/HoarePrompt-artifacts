Output State: **n is greater than 0, d is -2, v is the previous value of v, u is the return value of func_1(-2), path contains the previous v, remaining_vertices does not contain the previous v and is not empty.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains greater than 0, and `d` remains -2, as they are not modified by the code. The value of `v` is the previous value of `v`, and `u` is the return value of `func_1(-2)`, as they are not changed by the code. The `path` now contains the previous value of `v`, as it is appended to the `path` list. The `remaining_vertices` list no longer contains the previous value of `v`, as it is removed, and it is not empty.
