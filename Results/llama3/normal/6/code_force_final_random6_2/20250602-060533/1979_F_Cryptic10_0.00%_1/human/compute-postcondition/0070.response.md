Output State: **`remaining_vertices` is an empty set, `path` contains all the integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) in the order they were removed from `remaining_vertices`, and this is printed: "!' followed by the path which is the sequence of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) in the order they were removed from `remaining_vertices`, with each integer separated by a space, and the output buffer is flushed.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that the output buffer is flushed, meaning that any buffered output is immediately written to the output device. The values of `remaining_vertices` and `path` remain unchanged, and the printed output remains the same.
