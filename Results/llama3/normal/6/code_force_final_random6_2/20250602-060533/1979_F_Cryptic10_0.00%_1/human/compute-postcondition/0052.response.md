Output State: **n is greater than 0, d is within the range of n - 1 to -1, u is the return value of func_1(d), remaining_vertices does not contain v, path contains all the v values that were in remaining_vertices during the loop execution, including the current value of v.**

The code snippet consists of three lines. The first line appends the current value of `v` to the `path` list. The second line removes the current value of `v` from the `remaining_vertices` list. The third line breaks out of the loop.

After executing the code, the value of `n` remains greater than 0, and the value of `d` remains within the range of `n - 1` to `-1`. The value of `u` is still the return value of `func_1(d)`. The `remaining_vertices` list no longer contains the current value of `v`, which has been removed. The `path` list now contains all the `v` values that were in `remaining_vertices` during the loop execution, including the current value of `v`. The loop is terminated due to the `break` statement.
