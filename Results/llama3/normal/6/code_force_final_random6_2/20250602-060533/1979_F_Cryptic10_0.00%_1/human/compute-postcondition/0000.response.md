Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, path is an empty list, remaining_vertices is a set containing integers from 1 to n (inclusive)**.

The code initializes an empty list `path` and a set `remaining_vertices` containing integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive). The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The `path` list is empty, and the `remaining_vertices` set contains all integers from 1 to `n`, as specified by the `range(1, n + 1)` function.
