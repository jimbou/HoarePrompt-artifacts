Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `d` equals -1, `v` and `u` are the return values of `func_1(-1)`, `remaining_vertices` is not empty, `path` contains all the `v` values that were in `remaining_vertices` during the loop execution, and `remaining_vertices` does not contain any of the `v` values that were added to `path`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for `n`, `d`, `v`, and `u` as in the initial state, but `path` will contain all the `v` values that were in `remaining_vertices` during the loop execution, and `remaining_vertices` will not contain any of the `v` values that were added to `path`.
