The code `continue` skips the rest of the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration of the loop. Since the initial state does not specify which loop we are in, we will assume that we are in a loop that iterates over `remaining_vertices`.

The values of `n`, `d`, `v`, and `u` are not affected by the `continue` statement. However, since we are moving on to the next iteration of the loop, the current value of `v` is no longer relevant, and we can remove it from the output state.

The output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `d` equals `n-1`, `v` and `u` are the return values of `func_1(n-1)`, and `remaining_vertices` is not empty.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `d` equals `n-1`, `v` and `u` are the return values of `func_1(n-1)`, and `remaining_vertices` is not empty.**
