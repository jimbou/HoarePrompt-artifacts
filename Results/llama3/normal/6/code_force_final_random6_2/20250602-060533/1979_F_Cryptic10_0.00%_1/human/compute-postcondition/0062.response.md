Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `d` is within the range of `n - 3` to `-1`, `v` is the first return value of `func_1(d)`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(d)`, and `path` contains all the `v` values that were in `remaining_vertices` during the loop execution. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, then `v` is removed from `remaining_vertices` and appended to `path`. Otherwise, `remaining_vertices` and `path` remain unchanged, and we skip the rest of the current iteration and move on to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip the rest of the current iteration and move on to the next iteration of the loop. The values of `n`, `d`, `v`, `u`, `path`, and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged.
