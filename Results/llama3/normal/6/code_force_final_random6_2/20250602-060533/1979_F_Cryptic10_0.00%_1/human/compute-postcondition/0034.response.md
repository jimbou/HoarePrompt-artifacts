Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `d` equals `n-2`, `v` and `u` are the return values of `func_1(n-2)`, `remaining_vertices` is not empty, and if the previous `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, then the previous `v` is in `path` and not in `remaining_vertices`, and we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `n`, `d`, `v`, `u`, `remaining_vertices`, and `path` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration due to the `continue` statement.
