Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `d` is `n-3`, `v` and `u` are the return values of `func_1(n-3)`. If `v` is in the set `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not equal to 0, then `path` is a list containing `v`, and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) excluding `v`. Otherwise, the values of `path` and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged. We skip the rest of the code in the current loop iteration.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the additional information that we skip the rest of the code in the current loop iteration due to the `continue` statement. The values of `n`, `d`, `v`, `u`, `path`, and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged.
