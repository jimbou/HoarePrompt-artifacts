According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `d` and `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `path` is an empty list, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `d` is now `n-1`. 
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `d` is `n-1`, `path` is an empty list, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive)**
