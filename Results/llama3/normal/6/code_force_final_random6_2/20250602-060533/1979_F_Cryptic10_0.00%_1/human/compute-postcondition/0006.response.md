Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `d` is `n-1`, `path` is an empty list, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), `v` and `u` are the return values of `func_1(d)`. If `v` is 0, the function skips to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the function continues with the current values of `n`, `d`, `path`, `remaining_vertices`, `v`, and `u`.***
