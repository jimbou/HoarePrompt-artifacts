Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is greater than 0, `d` is -1, `v` and `u` are the return values of `func_1(-1)`, `remaining_vertices` is not empty
Code of the loop:
for d in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    v, u = func_1(d)
    if v == 0:
        continue
    if v in remaining_vertices:
        path.append(v)
        remaining_vertices.remove(v)
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than 0, `d` equals `n-1`, `v` and `u` are the return values of `func_1(n-1)`, and `remaining_vertices` is not empty. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, then `v` is added to `path` and removed from `remaining_vertices`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `path` and `remaining_vertices`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is greater than 0, d equals n-2, v and u are the return values of func_1(n-2), if v is in remaining_vertices, then path contains the previous v, remaining_vertices does not contain the previous v and is not empty, and the loop has been terminated. Otherwise, the execution of the loop continues.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 0, `d` is -2, `v` and `u` are the return values of func_1(-2). If `v` is in remaining_vertices, then path contains the previous `v`, remaining_vertices does not contain the previous `v` and is not empty. Otherwise, the loop continues with the current values of `n`, `d`, `v`, and `u`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
