Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `d` is -2, `v` and `u` are the return values of func_1(-2), if v is in remaining_vertices, then path contains the previous v, remaining_vertices does not contain the previous v and is not empty**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `d` remain unchanged. The values of `v` and `u` are updated to be the return values of `func_1(-2)`, since `d` is -2. The conditions regarding `v`, `path`, and `remaining_vertices` are still valid, but the previous value of `v` is replaced by the new value returned by `func_1(-2)`.
