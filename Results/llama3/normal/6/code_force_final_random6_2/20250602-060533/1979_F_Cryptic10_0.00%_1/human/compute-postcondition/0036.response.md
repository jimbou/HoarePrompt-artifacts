Output State: **n is greater than 0, d equals n-2, v and u are the return values of func_1(n-2), path contains the previous v, remaining_vertices does not contain the previous v and is not empty, and the loop has been terminated.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `d` also remains the same, as it is not affected by the code. The values of `v` and `u` are still the return values of `func_1(n-2)`, as they are not modified by the code. The `path` now contains the previous value of `v`, which was appended to it by the first line of the code. The `remaining_vertices` no longer contains the previous value of `v`, as it was removed by the second line of the code. The loop has been terminated due to the `break` statement in the third line of the code.
