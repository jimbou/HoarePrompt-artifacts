Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `d` is `n-1`, `v` and `u` are the return values of `func_1(n-1)`, `remaining_vertices` is not empty**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `d` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the code. The values of `v` and `u` are updated to be the return values of `func_1(n-1)`, which means they are now equal to the output of the function `func_1` when called with the argument `n-1`. The state of `remaining_vertices` is still not empty, as it is not affected by the code.
