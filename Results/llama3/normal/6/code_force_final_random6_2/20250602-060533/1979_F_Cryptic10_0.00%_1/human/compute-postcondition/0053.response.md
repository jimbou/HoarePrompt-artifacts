Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `d` is within the range of `n - 1` to `-1`, `u` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `remaining_vertices` does not contain `v`, and `path` contains all the `v` values that were in `remaining_vertices` during the loop execution, including the current value of `v` if `v` is in `remaining_vertices`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
