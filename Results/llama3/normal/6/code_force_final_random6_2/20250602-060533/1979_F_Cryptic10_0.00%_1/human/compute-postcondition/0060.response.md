The only variable in the loop head is variable `d`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `d`. If `d` is greater than -1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `d` is within the range of `n - 2` to `-2`, so for the loop to execute again `d` must be decreased by 1 and must be greater than -1.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `d` is within the range of `n - 3` to `-1`, `v` is the first return value of `func_1(d)`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(d)`, and `path` contains all the `v` values that were in `remaining_vertices` during the loop execution. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, then `v` is removed from `remaining_vertices` and appended to `path`. Otherwise, `remaining_vertices` and `path` remain unchanged.**
