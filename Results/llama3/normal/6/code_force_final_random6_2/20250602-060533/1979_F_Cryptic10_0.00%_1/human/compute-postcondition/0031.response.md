Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `d` equals `n-1`, `v` and `u` are the return values of `func_1(n-1)`, and `remaining_vertices` is not empty. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, then `v` is added to `path` and removed from `remaining_vertices`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `path` and `remaining_vertices`.***
