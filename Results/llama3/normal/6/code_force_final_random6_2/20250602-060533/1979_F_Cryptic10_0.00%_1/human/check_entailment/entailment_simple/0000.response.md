Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve an interactive problem where the goal is to find a Hamiltonian path in a complete undirected graph with n vertices, after removing exactly (n - 2) edges. The program uses a query-based approach to find the Hamiltonian path.

The program starts by initializing an empty path and a set of remaining vertices. It then enters a loop that continues until all vertices have been removed from the set of remaining vertices.

Inside the loop, the program iterates over the possible degrees of the vertices in descending order. For each degree, it calls function func_1 to query the graph and get the vertex with the minimum degree and the vertex that is not connected to it. If the queried vertex is in the set of remaining vertices, it is added to the path and removed from the set of remaining vertices.

After the loop, the program prints the Hamiltonian path in the order the vertices were removed from the set of remaining vertices.

The program's approach is correct because it ensures that each vertex is visited exactly once, and the path is constructed in a way that guarantees it is a Hamiltonian path.

Correctness: **True**
