Output State: **n is greater than 0, d is n-1, v and u are the return values of func_1(n-1), path contains v, and remaining_vertices is not empty but does not contain v.**

The code snippet modifies the state of the variables as follows: 

- The first line appends the value of `v` to the list `path`. 
- The second line removes the value of `v` from the list `remaining_vertices`. 
- The third line breaks out of the loop or conditional statement it is part of, but this does not affect the state of the variables.

The values of `n`, `d`, `v`, and `u` are not modified by the code snippet. The value of `d` remains `n-1`, and `v` and `u` remain the return values of `func_1(n-1)`. The list `remaining_vertices` is modified by removing the value of `v`, but it is still not empty.
