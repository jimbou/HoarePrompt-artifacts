Output State: **n is greater than 0, d is n-1, path is a list containing v, remaining_vertices is a set containing integers from 1 to n (inclusive) excluding v, v and u are the return values of func_1(d), and the current value of v is not in the set remaining_vertices.**

The code snippet modifies the initial state by appending the value of `v` to the `path` list, removing `v` from the `remaining_vertices` set, and breaking out of a loop (not shown in the provided code snippet). The values of `n`, `d`, and the return values of `func_1(d)` (`v` and `u`) remain unchanged. The only changes are the addition of `v` to the `path` list and its removal from the `remaining_vertices` set.
