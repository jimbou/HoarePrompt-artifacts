Output State: **n is greater than 0, d is n-2, v and u are the return values of func_1(d), path is a list containing v, and remaining_vertices is a set containing integers from 1 to n (inclusive) excluding v.**

The code block modifies the values of `path` and `remaining_vertices` based on the value of `v`. If `v` is in the set `remaining_vertices` and is not equal to 0, then `path` is updated to include `v`, and `remaining_vertices` is updated to exclude `v`. If `v` is equal to 0 or is not in the set `remaining_vertices`, then the values of `path` and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged. The values of `n`, `d`, `v`, and `u` are not modified by the code block.
