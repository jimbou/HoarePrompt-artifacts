Output State: **`remaining_vertices` is an empty set, `path` contains all the integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) in the order they were removed from `remaining_vertices`.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `remaining_vertices` is an empty set, and `path` contains all the integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) in the order they were removed from `remaining_vertices`. This means that the loop has iterated over all the vertices in the graph, and the path contains the order in which they were visited.
