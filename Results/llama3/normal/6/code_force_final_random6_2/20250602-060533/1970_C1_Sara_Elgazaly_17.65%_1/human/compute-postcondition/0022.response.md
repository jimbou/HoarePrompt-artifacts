Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer greater than 1, `y` is the last element that was in `lst[x]`, `lst` is a dictionary where each key is a node in a graph and its corresponding value is a list of its neighbors, `lst[x]` has at least one element, `s` is True, stdin is empty. If `lst[y]` is not empty, then `x` is updated to `y` and `y` is updated to the last element that was in `lst[y]`.***
