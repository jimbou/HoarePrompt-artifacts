The only variable in the loop head is `lst[x]`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `lst[x]`. If `lst[x]` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `lst[x]` is not empty but has one less element than before. So for the loop to be executed one more time `lst[x]` must have at least one element.
State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `y` is the last element that was in `lst[x]`, `lst` is a dictionary where each key is a node in a graph and its corresponding value is a list of its neighbors, `lst[x]` is not empty and has at least one element, `s` is False, stdin is empty.**
