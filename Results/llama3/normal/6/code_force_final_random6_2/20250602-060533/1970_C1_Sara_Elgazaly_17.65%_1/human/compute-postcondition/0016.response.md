Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `y` is the second last element that was in `lst[x]`, `lst` is a dictionary where each key is a node in a graph and its corresponding value is a list of its neighbors, `lst[x]` is not empty and had at least 1 element, `s` is True, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been updated to the second last element that was in `lst[x]` because the `pop()` function removes and returns the last element from the list `lst[x]`. The size of `lst[x]` has been reduced by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
