Output State: **x is an integer greater than 1, y is 1, lst is a dictionary where the key a has a list containing b, a, b and the key b has a list containing a, b, a, stdin contains x-3 lines each containing two integers between 1 and x (inclusive), and finally one integer between 1 and x (inclusive)**

In this output state, the values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged. The dictionary `lst` has been modified by appending `b` to the list of key `a` and `a` to the list of key `b`. The stdin now contains `x-3` lines each containing two integers between 1 and `x` (inclusive), and finally one integer between 1 and `x` (inclusive).
