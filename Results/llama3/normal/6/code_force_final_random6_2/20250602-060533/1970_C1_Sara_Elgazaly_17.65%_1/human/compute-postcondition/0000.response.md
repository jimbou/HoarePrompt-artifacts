The code reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to `x` and `y`. Since `n` is an integer between 2 and 200000 (inclusive) and `t` is 1, `x` becomes an integer between 2 and 200000 (inclusive) and `y` becomes 1. The second line creates an empty dictionary called `lst` with default values as lists.

Output State: **x is an integer between 2 and 200000 (inclusive), y is 1, lst is an empty dictionary with default values as lists, stdin contains n-1 lines each containing two integers between 1 and x (inclusive), and finally one integer between 1 and x (inclusive).**
