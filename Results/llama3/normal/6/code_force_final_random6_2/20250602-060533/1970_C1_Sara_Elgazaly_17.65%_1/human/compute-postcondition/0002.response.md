Output State: **x is an integer greater than 1, y is 1, lst is a dictionary where the key a has a list containing b and the key b has a list containing a, stdin contains x-2 lines each containing two integers between 1 and x (inclusive), and finally one integer between 1 and x (inclusive)**

In this output state, the value of x remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of y also remains unchanged as it is not used or modified by the code. The dictionary lst is updated with two new key-value pairs: the key a has a list containing b, and the key b has a list containing a. The stdin contains x-2 lines each containing two integers between 1 and x (inclusive), and finally one integer between 1 and x (inclusive), as one line has been consumed by the input() function.
