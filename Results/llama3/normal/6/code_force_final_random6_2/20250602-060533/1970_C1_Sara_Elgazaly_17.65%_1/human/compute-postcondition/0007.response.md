Output State: **x is an integer greater than 1, y is 1, lst is a dictionary where each key is a node in a graph and its corresponding value is a list of its neighbors, stdin is empty**.

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the value of x remains unchanged, y remains 1, and the dictionary lst represents an undirected graph where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighbors. The stdin is empty because all the input lines have been read and processed by the loop.
