Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer greater than 1, `y` is the last element that was in `lst[x]`, `lst` is a dictionary where each key is a node in a graph and its corresponding value is a list of its neighbors, `lst[x]` is not empty and has at least one less element than before, `s` is False, stdin is empty. If `lst[y]` is not empty, then `x` is set to `y`.***
