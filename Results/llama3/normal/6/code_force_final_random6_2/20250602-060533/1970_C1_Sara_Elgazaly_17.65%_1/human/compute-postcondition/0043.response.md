Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `y` is the second last element that was in `lst[x]`, `lst` is a dictionary where each key is a node in a graph and its corresponding value is a list of its neighbors, `lst[x]` is not empty and has one less element than before, `s` is True, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been updated to the second last element that was in `lst[x]`, because the `pop()` function removes and returns the last element from the list `lst[x]`. The list `lst[x]` now has one less element than before, but it is still not empty. The other variables `x`, `lst`, `s`, and stdin remain unchanged.
