Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `y` is the last element that was in `lst[x]`, `lst` is a dictionary where each key is a node in a graph and its corresponding value is a list of its neighbors, `lst[x]` is empty, `s` is False, stdin is empty.**

The loop will continue to execute until `lst[x]` is empty. At that point, the loop will terminate, and the final output state will be reached. In this state, `x` will still be an integer greater than 1, `y` will be the last element that was in `lst[x]`, `lst` will still be a dictionary representing the graph, `lst[x]` will be empty, `s` will still be False, and stdin will still be empty.
