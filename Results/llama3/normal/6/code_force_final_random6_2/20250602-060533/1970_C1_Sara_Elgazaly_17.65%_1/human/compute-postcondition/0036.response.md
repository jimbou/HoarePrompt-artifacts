Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `y` is the last element that was in `lst[x]`, `lst` is a dictionary where each key is a node in a graph and its corresponding value is a list of its neighbors, `lst[x]` is not empty and has at least one less element than before, `lst[y]` is not empty, `s` is False, stdin is empty.**

The code `y = lst[x].pop()` removes the last element from the list `lst[x]` and assigns it to `y`. Since `lst[x]` is not empty and has at least one less element than before, the size of `lst[x]` decreases by 1. The value of `y` is updated to the last element that was in `lst[x]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
