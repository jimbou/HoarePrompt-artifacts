To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and `x`. The loop will execute as long as `x` is greater than 1.

State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `y` is 1, `lst` is an empty dictionary with default values as lists, `stdin` contains `x-1` lines each containing two integers between 1 and `x` (inclusive), and finally one integer between 1 and `x` (inclusive)**
