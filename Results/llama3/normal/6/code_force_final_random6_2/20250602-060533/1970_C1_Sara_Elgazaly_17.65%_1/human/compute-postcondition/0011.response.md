The code `y = lst[x].pop()` removes the last element from the list of neighbors of node `x` in the graph and assigns it to `y`. The value of `x` is an integer greater than 1, and `lst[x]` is not empty, so the last element of `lst[x]` is removed and assigned to `y`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `y` is the last element that was in `lst[x]`, `lst` is a dictionary where each key is a node in a graph and its corresponding value is a list of its neighbors, `lst[x]` is not empty but has one less element than before, `s` is True, stdin is empty**
