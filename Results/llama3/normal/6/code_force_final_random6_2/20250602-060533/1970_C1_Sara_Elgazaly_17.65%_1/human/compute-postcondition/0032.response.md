The code `y = lst[x].pop()` removes the last element from the list of neighbors of node `x` in the graph and assigns it to `y`. Since `y` was already the last element in `lst[x]`, its value does not change. However, `lst[x]` now has one less element.

Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `y` is the last element that was in `lst[x]`, `lst` is a dictionary where each key is a node in a graph and its corresponding value is a list of its neighbors, `lst[x]` is not empty and has at least one less element than before, `s` is False, stdin is empty.**
