Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `y` is the last element that was in `lst[x]`, `lst` is a dictionary where each key is a node in a graph and its corresponding value is a list of its neighbors, `lst[x]` is empty, `s` is False if the number of iterations is even, True if the number of iterations is odd, stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `x` remains an integer greater than 1, `y` is the last element that was in the list of neighbors of `x`, the graph represented by `lst` remains unchanged, the list of neighbors of `x` is empty, and the value of `s` alternates between True and False depending on whether the number of iterations is even or odd.
