The only variable in the loop head is `lst[x]`, so we can only adjust that one.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `lst[x]`. If `lst[x]` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `lst[x]` is not empty and had at least 1 element before the last iteration. However, this does not ensure that the loop will execute again, because `lst[x]` might have been emptied in the last iteration. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `lst[x]` to ensure it is not empty.

State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `y` is the last element that was in `lst[x]`, `lst` is a dictionary where each key is a node in a graph and its corresponding value is a list of its neighbors, `lst[x]` is not empty, `s` is True, stdin is empty. If `lst[y]` is not empty, then `x` is equal to `y`, `y` is the last element that was in `lst[y]`, `lst[y]` is not empty.**
