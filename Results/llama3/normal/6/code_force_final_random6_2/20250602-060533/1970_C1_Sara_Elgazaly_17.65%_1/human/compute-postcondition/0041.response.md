The only variable in the loop head is variable lst[x], so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable lst[x].  If lst[x] is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, lst[x] is empty, So for the loop to be executed one more time lst[x] must not be empty.
State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `y` is the last element that was in `lst[x]`, `lst` is a dictionary where each key is a node in a graph and its corresponding value is a list of its neighbors, `lst[x]` is not empty, `s` is True, stdin is empty.**
