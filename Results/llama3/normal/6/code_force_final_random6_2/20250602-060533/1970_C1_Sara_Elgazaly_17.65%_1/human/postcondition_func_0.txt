This function reads input from stdin representing a graph, traverses the graph in a specific manner, and prints 'Hermione' if the number of iterations is odd or 'Ron' if the number of iterations is even. The graph is represented as a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighbors. The function does not modify the graph structure but empties the list of neighbors of the last visited node.
