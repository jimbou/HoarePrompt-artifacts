Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `y` is the last element that was in `lst[x]`, `lst` is a dictionary where each key is a node in a graph and its corresponding value is a list of its neighbors, `lst[x]` is empty, `s` is True, stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that `x` remains an integer greater than 1, `y` is the last element that was in the list of neighbors of `x` in the graph, the graph remains unchanged, the list of neighbors of `x` is now empty, `s` remains True, and the standard input remains empty.
