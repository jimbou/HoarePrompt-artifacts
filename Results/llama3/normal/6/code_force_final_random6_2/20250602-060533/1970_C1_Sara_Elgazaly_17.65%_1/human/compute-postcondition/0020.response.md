Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `y` is the last element that was in `lst[x]`, `lst` is a dictionary where each key is a node in a graph and its corresponding value is a list of its neighbors, `lst[x]` has at least one element, `lst[y]` has at least one more element, `s` is True, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been updated to be the last element that was in `lst[x]`, because the `pop()` function removes and returns the last element from the list `lst[x]`. The length of `lst[x]` has been reduced by one, but it still has at least one element. The other variables remain unchanged.
