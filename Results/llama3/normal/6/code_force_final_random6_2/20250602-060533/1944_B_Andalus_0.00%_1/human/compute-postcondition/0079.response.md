Output State: T is greater than 0, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing all the values of lft[i] where lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], rdb is a list containing all the values of rgt[i] where rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], sng is a list containing all the values of lft[i] where i is less than n - 1 and lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], elem is the last element in the list, i is equal to n, and sz is equal to k or the maximum value that is less than k and is a multiple of 2 plus the number of elements in the list sng. If sz is greater than or equal to k, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, all elements of the list sng are printed.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop will continue to iterate over the list `sng` and print all elements as long as `sz` is less than `k`. Once `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop will break. The final value of `sz` will be either `k` or the maximum value less than `k` that is a multiple of 2 plus the number of elements in the list `sng`.
