Output State: **`T` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is less than `n`, `ldb` is a list containing the value of `lft[i]`, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, `elem` is undefined, `sz` is equal to `k`. The current value of `lft[i]` is equal to the current value of `lft[i - 1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `lft[i]` has been appended to the list `ldb`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The value of `lft[i]` is still equal to the value of `lft[i - 1]`, indicating that the current element in the sorted list `lft` is the same as the previous one.
