Output State: **`T` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least two values equal to the previous value, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is equal to n, `ldb` is a list containing all the values of `lft` that are equal to the previous value and must have at least two elements, `rdb` is a list containing all the values of `rgt` that are equal to the previous value, `sng` is a list containing all the values of `lft` that are not equal to the previous value and the next value, `elem` is the second element in `ldb`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code only contains a `break` statement, which means it will exit the innermost loop or conditional statement it is currently in. The values of all variables remain unchanged, but the program flow is altered by breaking out of the loop or conditional statement.
