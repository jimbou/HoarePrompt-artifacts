The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is equal to `n`, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is less than `n`. 

State: **`T` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is less than `n`, `sz` is equal to `k` or the number of pairs of duplicate elements in `rgt` that are printed, whichever is smaller plus the number of elements in `sng`, `ldb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements in `lft`, `rdb` is an empty list, and `sng` is a list containing all the single elements in `lft`.**
