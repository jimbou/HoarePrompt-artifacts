Output State: **`T` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is equal to `n`, `sz` is equal to or greater than `k`, `ldb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements in `lft`, `rdb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements in `rgt` that must have at least 1 element, `sng` is an empty list, `elem` is the first element in the list `rdb`, and nothing is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all the variables retain their original values and properties as specified in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement due to the `break` statement.
