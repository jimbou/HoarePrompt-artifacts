To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 2 (since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n`). 

Since `i` is currently equal to `n`, we need to adjust it to be less than `n` for the loop to execute. The smallest value `i` can take is 1, as specified in the range.

State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the values of `lft[i]` where `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing all the values of `lft[i]` where `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, and `i` is 1**
