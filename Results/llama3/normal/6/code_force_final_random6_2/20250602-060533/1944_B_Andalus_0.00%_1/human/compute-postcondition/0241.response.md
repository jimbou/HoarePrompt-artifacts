To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for elem in sng:`. The only objects in the loop head are `elem` and `sng`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `sng`. If the list `sng` has at least 2 elements, the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `sng` has at least 1 element, `elem` is the first element in the list `sng`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list `sng` must have at least 2 elements and `elem` is the second element in the list `sng`.

State: **`T` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is equal to `n`, `ldb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements in `lft`, `rdb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements in `rgt` that must have at least `floor(k/2)` elements, `sng` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `elem` is the second element in the list `sng`, `sz` is increased by 1**
