Output State: **`T` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is less than `n - 1`, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing `lft[i]`, `elem` is undefined, `sz` is equal to `k`, and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `T` is still greater than 2, and the value of `_` is still 2. The number of test cases in `stdin` is still multiple test cases minus 2. The value of `n` is still an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive. The list `lst` still contains 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive. The lists `lft` and `rgt` are still sorted lists of n integers between 1 and n inclusive. The value of `i` is still less than `n - 1`. The lists `ldb` and `rdb` are still empty. The list `sng` now contains the value of `lft[i]`. The value of `elem` is still undefined. The value of `sz` is still equal to `k`. The value of `lft[i]` is still not equal to `lft[i - 1]` and `lft[i]` is still not equal to `lft[i + 1]`.
