To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `elem` and `rdb`. The loop will execute if `rdb` is not empty, meaning it must have at least one element. Since `elem` is the variable that will take on the values from `rdb` during each iteration, we can adjust its state to reflect that it will be the first element in `rdb` at the start of the loop.

State: **`T` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least one value that is not equal to the previous value and the next value, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is equal to n, `ldb` is a list containing all the values of lft that are equal to the previous value, `rdb` is a list containing all the values of rgt that are equal to the previous value and must have at least one element, `sng` is an empty list, `elem` is the first element in `rdb`, and `sz` is 0, and nothing is printed**
