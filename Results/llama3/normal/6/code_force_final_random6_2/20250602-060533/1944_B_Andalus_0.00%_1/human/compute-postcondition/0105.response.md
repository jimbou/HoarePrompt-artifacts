Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive and has at least two duplicate elements, `ldb` is a list containing all the values of `lft[i]` where `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, `rdb` is a list containing all the values of `rgt[i]` where `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]` and has at least three elements, `sng` is a list containing all the values of `lft[i]` where `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, `elem` is the third element in `rdb`, `i` is equal to `n`, and `sz` is increased by 2. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the third element of `rdb` is printed twice, separated by a space.**

In this output state, the value of `sz` has been increased by 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The program still has multiple test cases minus 1 in `stdin`, and the lists `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, `rdb`, and `sng` maintain their properties. The value of `elem` is still the third element in `rdb`, and `i` is still equal to `n`. The program's behavior regarding breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement and printing the third element of `rdb` twice, separated by a space, remains the same.
