The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 1 and between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer greater than 3 and between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` is a list containing the current value of `lft[i]`, `rdb` is an empty list, and `sng` is an empty list. Otherwise, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, and if `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` is a list containing one integer which is equal to `lft[i]`. Otherwise, `sng` is an empty list. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `i` is 3. Otherwise, if `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `i` is 4. Otherwise, `i` is 3.**
