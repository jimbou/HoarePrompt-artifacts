The only object in the loop head is variable  elem and list ldb, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list ldb.  If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, ldb has at least 2 elements, elem is the second element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the elem is the third element in the list.
State: **T is greater than 1, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, i is equal to n, sz is equal to 4 if k - sz >= 0, otherwise sz remains the same, ldb is a list containing all the duplicate elements in lft that must have at least 3 elements, rdb is a list containing all the duplicate elements in rgt, sng is a list containing all the single elements in lft, and elem is the third element in ldb.**
