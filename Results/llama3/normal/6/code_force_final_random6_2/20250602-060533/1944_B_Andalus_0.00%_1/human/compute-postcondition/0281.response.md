Output State: **`T` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is 2, `ldb` is a list containing all the values of `lft` that are equal to the previous value, `sng` is a list containing all the values of `lft` that are not equal to the previous value and the next value, `elem` is undefined, `sz` is equal to `k`, `rdb` is a list containing the current value of `rgt[i]` and the previous value of `rgt[i]`.**

The code appends the current value of `rgt[i]` to the list `rdb`. Since `i` is 2, the current value of `rgt[i]` is appended to `rdb`. The other variables remain unchanged.
