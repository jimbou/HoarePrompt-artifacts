The code prints the second element in the list `sng`, which is `elem`, followed by a space. The list `sng` contains all the values of `lft[i]` where `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, and must have at least 2 elements. Since `elem` is the second element in the list `sng`, it is one of the values of `lft[i]` that meets the specified conditions.

Output: **the second element in the list sng (which is one of the values of lft[i] where i is less than n - 1 and lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1])**
