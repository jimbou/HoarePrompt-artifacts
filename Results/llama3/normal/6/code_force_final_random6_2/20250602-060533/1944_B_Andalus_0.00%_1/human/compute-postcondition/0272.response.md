Output State: **`T` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is less than `n` and `i` is not equal to `n`. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` is a list containing the value of `lft[i]`, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing `lft[i]`, `elem` is undefined, `sz` is equal to `k`. If `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing `lft[i]` if `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `sng` is a list containing `lft[i]`, `elem` is undefined, `sz` is equal to `k`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `sng` now contains the value of `lft[i]`. This means that `sng` now has one more element, which is the current value of `lft[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
