To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `elem` and the list `sng`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `sng` is not empty. Since `sng` contains all the values of `lft` that are not equal to the previous value and the next value, we need to ensure that `lft` has at least one such value.

State: **T is greater than 2, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least one value that is not equal to the previous value and the next value, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, i is equal to n, ldb is a list containing all the values of lft that are equal to the previous value, rdb is a list containing all the values of rgt that are equal to the previous value, sng is a list containing all the values of lft that are not equal to the previous value and the next value that must have at least one value, elem is the first element in sng, and sz is increased by 2 for each pair of elements in ldb that are equal to the previous value and have k - sz greater than or equal to 2**
