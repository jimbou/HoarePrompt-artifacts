Output State: **`T` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is equal to n, `sz` is equal to 2 if k - sz >= 2, otherwise sz remains the same, `ldb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements in lft that must have at least 2 elements, `rdb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements in rgt, `sng` is a list containing all the single elements in lft, and `elem` is the second element in ldb, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with all variables retaining their original values and properties. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, but this does not affect the values of the variables.
