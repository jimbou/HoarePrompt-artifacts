Output State: **`T` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is equal to `n`, `ldb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements in `lft`, `rdb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements in `rgt` that must have at least `floor(k/2)` elements, `sng` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `elem` is the first element in the list `sng`, and the current value of `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code executes a break statement, which means it exits the innermost loop or if statement it is currently inside. The values of all variables remain unchanged, but the program flow is altered as it breaks out of the loop or if statement.
