Output State: **T is greater than 1, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, i is equal to n, the current value of sz is greater than or equal to k, ldb is a list containing all the duplicate elements in lft that must have at least 1 element, rdb is a list containing all the duplicate elements in rgt, sng is a list containing all the single elements in lft, and elem is the first element in ldb, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. This means that the values of all variables remain unchanged, but the program execution will exit the current loop or if statement.
