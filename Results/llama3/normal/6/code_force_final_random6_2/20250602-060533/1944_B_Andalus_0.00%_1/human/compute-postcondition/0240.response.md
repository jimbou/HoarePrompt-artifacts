Output State: **`T` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is equal to `n`, `ldb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements in `lft`, `rdb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements in `rgt` that must have at least `floor(k/2)` elements, `sng` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `elem` is the first element in the list `sng`, `sz` is increased by 1, and if the current value of `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the first element of the list `sng` which is `elem` is printed.**

In this output state, the value of `sz` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The program will break out of the most internal loop or if statement if the current value of `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, and the first element of the list `sng`, which is `elem`, will be printed.
