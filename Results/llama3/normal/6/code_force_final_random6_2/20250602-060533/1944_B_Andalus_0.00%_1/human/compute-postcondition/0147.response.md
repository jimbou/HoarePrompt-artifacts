Output State: **`T` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is 3, `sz` is unknown, `ldb` is unknown, `rdb` is unknown, `sng` contains one more element which is the fourth element of `lft`**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state except that the list `sng` now contains one more element, which is the fourth element of the sorted list `lft`. The value of `i` is still 3, and the other variables remain unchanged.
