Output State: **T is greater than 1, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, i is equal to n, sz is equal to the minimum of k and 2 times the length of ldb plus 1, ldb is a list containing all the duplicate elements in lft, rdb is a list containing all the duplicate elements in rgt, sng is a list containing all the single elements in lft that must have at least 1 single element, elem is the first single element in the list sng, and the first single element in the list sng which is elem is printed, followed by a space**

In this output state, the value of sz has been incremented by 1, resulting in sz being equal to the minimum of k and 2 times the length of ldb plus 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
