Output: **`T` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least one value that is not equal to the previous value and the next value, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is equal to n, `ldb` is a list containing all the values of lft that are equal to the previous value, `rdb` is a list containing all the values of rgt that are equal to the previous value, `sng` is a list containing all the values of lft that are not equal to the previous value and the next value that must have at least 3 values, `elem` is the third element in sng, and `sz` is increased by 1. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the third element of the list sng which is elem is printed.**
