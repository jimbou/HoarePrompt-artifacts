To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 2 (since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n`). 

Before the loop starts, `i` is equal to `n`, which means the loop will not execute because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `i` to be less than `n` for the loop to execute.

State: **`T` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is less than `n`, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, `elem` is undefined, `sz` is equal to `k`**
