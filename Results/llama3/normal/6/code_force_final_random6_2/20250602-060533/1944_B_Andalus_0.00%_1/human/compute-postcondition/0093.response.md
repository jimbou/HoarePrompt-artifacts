The only object in the loop head is variable  elem and list rdb, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list rdb.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, rdb has at least one element, elem is the first element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the elem is the second element in the list.
State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive and has at least two duplicate elements, `ldb` is a list containing all the values of `lft[i]` where `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, `rdb` is a list containing all the values of `rgt[i]` where `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]` and has at least two elements, `sng` is a list containing all the values of `lft[i]` where `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, `elem` is the second element in `rdb`, and `i` is equal to `n`.**
