Output State: **T is greater than 0, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing all the values of lft[i] where lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], rdb is a list containing all the values of rgt[i] where rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], sng is a list containing all the values of lft[i] where i is less than n - 1 and lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], elem is the last element in the list, i is equal to n, and sz is equal to k or the number of pairs of duplicate elements in rgt that are printed, whichever is smaller.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has printed all possible pairs of duplicate elements from the list `rgt` until it has printed `k` pairs or until it has printed all pairs of duplicate elements, whichever comes first. The loop then breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the program continues executing the next statements.
