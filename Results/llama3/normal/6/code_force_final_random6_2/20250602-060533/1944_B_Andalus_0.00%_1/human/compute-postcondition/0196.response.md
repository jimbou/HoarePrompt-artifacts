Postcondition: ***T is greater than 1, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, i is equal to n, sz is equal to the minimum of k and 2 times the length of ldb plus 1, ldb is a list containing all the duplicate elements in lft, rdb is a list containing all the duplicate elements in rgt, sng is a list containing all the single elements in lft that must have at least 2 single elements, elem is the second single element in the list sng. If sz is greater than or equal to k, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
