Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1 and between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing one integer which is equal to `lft[i]`, `i` is 1, `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]`, and the current value of `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of T is still greater than 0, the value of _ is still 0, the number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 1, the values of n and k are still within their respective ranges, the lists lst, lft, and rgt still contain their respective values, the lists ldb and rdb are still empty, the list sng now contains one integer which is equal to the value of lft at index i, and the value of i is still 1. The conditions that the current value of i is less than n - 1, lft[i] is not equal to lft[i - 1], and lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1] are still valid.
