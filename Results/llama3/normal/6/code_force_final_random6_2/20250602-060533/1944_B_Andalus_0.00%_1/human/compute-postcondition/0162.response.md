Output State: **T is greater than 1, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, i is equal to n, sz is equal to 0, ldb is a list containing all the duplicate elements in lft, rdb is a list containing all the duplicate elements in rgt, and sng is a list containing all the single elements in lft.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of sz is reset to 0, while all other variables remain unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 2, and the values of T, _, n, k, lst, lft, rgt, i, ldb, rdb, and sng are still the same as before.
