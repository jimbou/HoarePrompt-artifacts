Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is 3, `sz` is unknown, `ldb` is unknown, `rdb` is unknown. If `i` is less than `n - 1` and the fourth element of `lft` is different from the fifth element of `lft`, then `sng` contains one more element which is the fourth element of `lft`.***
