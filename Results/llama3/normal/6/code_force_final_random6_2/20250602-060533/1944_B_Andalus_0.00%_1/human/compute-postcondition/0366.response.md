Output State: **T is greater than 2, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least one value that is not equal to the previous value and the next value, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, i is equal to n, ldb is a list containing all the values of lft that are equal to the previous value, rdb is an empty list, sng must have at least 1 element, and the first element in sng which is elem is printed followed by a space, sz is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the variable sz has been incremented by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
