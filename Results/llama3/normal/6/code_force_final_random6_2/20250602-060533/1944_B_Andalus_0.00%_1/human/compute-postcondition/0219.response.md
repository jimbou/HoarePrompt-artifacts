The only variable in the loop head is variable  elem and list rdb, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list rdb.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, rdb has at least 1 element, elem is the first element in the list rdb. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the elem is the second element in the list.
State: **`T` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is equal to `n`, `ldb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements in `lft`, `rdb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements in `rgt` that must have at least 2 elements, `sng` is an empty list, `elem` is the second element in the list `rdb`.**
