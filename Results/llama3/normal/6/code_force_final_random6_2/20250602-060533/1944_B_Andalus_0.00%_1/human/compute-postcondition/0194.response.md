To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for elem in sng:`.

From the given state at the end of the previous iteration, we know that `sng` is a list containing all the single elements in `lft` and must have at least 1 single element. We also know that `elem` is the first single element in the list `sng`, which is printed, followed by a space.

To execute the loop one more time, we need to adjust the state of `elem` and `sng`. Since `elem` is the first single element in `sng`, we need to move to the next single element in `sng`. Therefore, `elem` should be the second single element in `sng`.

Additionally, since `sng` must have at least 1 single element, we need to ensure that `sng` still has at least 2 single elements for the loop to execute again.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`T` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is equal to n, `sz` is equal to the minimum of k and 2 times the length of ldb plus 1, `ldb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements in lft, `rdb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements in rgt, `sng` is a list containing all the single elements in lft that must have at least 2 single elements, `elem` is the second single element in the list sng**
