Output State: **T is greater than 2, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least one value that is not equal to the previous value and the next value, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, i is equal to n, ldb is a list containing all the values of lft that are equal to the previous value, rdb is a list containing all the values of rgt that are equal to the previous value, sng is an empty list, elem is the last element in sng, and sz is increased by the length of sng.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated over all the elements in the list `sng` and has printed them. The list `sng` is now empty, and the variable `elem` is the last element that was printed. The variable `sz` has been increased by the length of the list `sng`, which means it has been increased by the number of elements that were printed. The other variables in the precondition remain unchanged.
