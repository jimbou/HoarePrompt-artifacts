Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the values of `lft[i]` where `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, `rdb` is a list containing all the values of `rgt[i]` where `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, `sng` is a list containing all the values of `lft[i]`, `elem` is the last element in the list, `i` is equal to `n`, and `sz` is equal to `k` or the number of pairs of duplicate elements in `rgt` that are printed, whichever is smaller plus the number of elements in `sng`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and all elements in `sng` are printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that the loop has iterated over all elements in the list `sng`, printing each element and incrementing the counter `sz` until it reaches the value of `k` or the number of pairs of duplicate elements in `rgt`, whichever is smaller. The loop then breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, leaving the program in a state where all elements in `sng` have been processed and printed. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
