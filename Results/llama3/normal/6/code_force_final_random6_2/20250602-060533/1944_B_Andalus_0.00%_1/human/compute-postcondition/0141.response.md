Output State: **`T` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is 2, `sz` is equal to `k` or the number of pairs of duplicate elements in `rgt` that are printed, whichever is smaller plus the number of elements in `sng`, `ldb` is a list containing the value of `lft[1]` and `lft[i]`, `rdb` is an empty list, and `sng` is an empty list if `i` is equal to `n - 1` or the element at index `i` in `lft` is equal to the element at index `i + 1` in `lft`, otherwise `sng` is a list containing the element at index `i` in `lft`.**

The code appends the value of `lft[i]` to the list `ldb`. Since `i` is 2, the value of `lft[2]` is appended to `ldb`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `ldb` now contains the values of `lft[1]` and `lft[2]`. The list `sng` remains empty if `i` is equal to `n - 1` or the element at index `i` in `lft` is equal to the element at index `i + 1` in `lft`, otherwise it contains the element at index `i` in `lft`.
