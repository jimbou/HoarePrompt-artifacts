Output State: **`T` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least one value that is not equal to the previous value and the next value, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is equal to n, `ldb` is a list containing all the values of `lft` that are equal to the previous value, `rdb` is a list containing all the values of `rgt` that are equal to the previous value and must have at least one element, `sng` is an empty list, `elem` is the first element in `rdb`, the first element of `rdb` which is equal to `elem` is printed twice with a space in between, and `sz` is increased by 2, and the current value of `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 0.**

In this output state, the value of `sz` has been increased by 2, and the current value of `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
