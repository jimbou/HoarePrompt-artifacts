The only variable in the loop head is variable `elem` and list `rdb`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `rdb`. If the list `rdb` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `rdb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements in `rgt`, so for the loop to be executed, `rdb` must have at least 1 element and `elem` is the first element in the list `rdb`.

State: **`T` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is equal to `n`, `sz` is equal to 0, `ldb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements in `lft`, `rdb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements in `rgt` that must have at least 1 element, `sng` is an empty list, `elem` is the first element in the list `rdb`, and nothing is printed.**
