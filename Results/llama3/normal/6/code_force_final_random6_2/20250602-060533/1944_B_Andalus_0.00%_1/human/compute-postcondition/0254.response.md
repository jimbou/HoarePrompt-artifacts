Output State: `T` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is equal to `n`, `ldb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements in `lft`, `rdb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements in `rgt` that must have at least `floor(k/2)` elements, `sng` is a list that must have at least `k` elements, `elem` is the last element in the list `sng`, `sz` is equal to `k`.

The loop will execute until `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, at which point it will break out of the loop. Since `sng` must have at least `k` elements, the loop will execute `k` times, printing each element in `sng` and incrementing `sz` by 1 each time. After the loop finishes, `sz` will be equal to `k`, and `elem` will be the last element in the list `sng`.
