Output State: **T is greater than 0, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing all the values of lft[i] where lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1] and must have at least 1 element, rdb is a list containing all the values of rgt[i] where rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], sng is a list containing all the values of lft[i] where i is less than n - 1 and lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], i is equal to n, and the current value of sz is either greater than or equal to k, in which case we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or sz is less than k. Additionally, the difference between k and sz is greater than or equal to 2, and this is printed: elem elem (where elem is an element of the list), sz is increased by 2.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of sz has been increased by 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
