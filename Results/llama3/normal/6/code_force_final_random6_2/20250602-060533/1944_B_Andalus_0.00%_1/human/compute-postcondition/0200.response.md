The only object in the loop head is variable  elem and list sng, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list sng.  If the list has at least 3 single elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, sng has at least 2 single elements, elem is the second single element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 single elements and elem is the third single element in the list.
State: **T is greater than 1, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, i is equal to n, sz is equal to the minimum of k and 2 times the length of ldb plus 2, ldb is a list containing all the duplicate elements in lft, rdb is a list containing all the duplicate elements in rgt, sng is a list containing all the single elements in lft that must have at least 3 single elements, and the third single element in the list sng which is elem is printed**
