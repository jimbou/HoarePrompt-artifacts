According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `sng`. If `sng` has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `T` is greater than 0, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing all the values of lft[i] where lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], rdb is a list containing all the values of rgt[i] where rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], elem is the last element in the list, i is equal to n, and sz is equal to k or the number of pairs of duplicate elements in rgt that are printed, whichever is smaller. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 element and the elem is the first element in the list.
State: **`T` is greater than 0, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing all the values of lft[i] where lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], rdb is a list containing all the values of rgt[i] where rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], sng is a list containing all the values of lft[i] that must have at least 1 element, elem is the first element in the list, i is equal to n, and sz is equal to k or the number of pairs of duplicate elements in rgt that are printed, whichever is smaller**
