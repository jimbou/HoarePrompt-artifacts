Output State: **T is greater than 1, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is an empty list, rdb is an empty list, sng is an empty list, elem is the last element in the list, i is equal to n, and sz is equal to k or the number of pairs of duplicate elements in rgt that are printed, whichever is smaller plus the number of elements in sng.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of T remains greater than 1, and the value of _ remains 1. The number of test cases in stdin decreases by 2. The values of n and k are updated to the input values, which are integers between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive and between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, respectively. The list lst contains 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive. The lists lft and rgt are sorted lists of n integers between 1 and n inclusive. The lists ldb, rdb, and sng are empty. The value of elem is the last element in the list, and the value of i is equal to n. The value of sz is equal to k or the number of pairs of duplicate elements in rgt that are printed, whichever is smaller, plus the number of elements in sng.
