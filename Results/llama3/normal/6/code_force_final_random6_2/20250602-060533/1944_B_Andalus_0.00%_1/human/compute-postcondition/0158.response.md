State: **`T` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is less than `n` and greater than the current value, `sz` is equal to `k` or the number of pairs of duplicate elements in `rgt` that are printed, whichever is smaller plus the number of elements in `sng`, `ldb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements in `lft`, `rdb` is a list containing the current value of `rgt[i]` if `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, otherwise `rdb` is a list containing the current value of `rgt[i]`, and `sng` is a list containing all the single elements in `lft`. If `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, then `rdb` contains the current value of `rgt[i]`. Otherwise, `rdb` contains the current value of `rgt[i]`.**
