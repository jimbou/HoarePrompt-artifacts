Postcondition: ***T is greater than 2, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least two values equal to the previous value, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, i is equal to n, ldb is a list containing all the values of lft that are equal to the previous value and must have at least three elements, rdb is a list containing all the values of rgt that are equal to the previous value, sng is a list containing all the values of lft that are not equal to the previous value and the next value, elem is the third element in ldb. If k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, sz is increased by 2. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
