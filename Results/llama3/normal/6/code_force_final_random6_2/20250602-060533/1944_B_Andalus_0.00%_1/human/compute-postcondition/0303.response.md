Output State: **`T` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least two values equal to the previous value, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is equal to n, `ldb` is a list containing all the values of `lft` that are equal to the previous value and must have at least two elements, `rdb` is a list containing all the values of `rgt` that are equal to the previous value, `sng` is a list containing all the values of `lft` that are not equal to the previous value and the next value, `elem` is the second element in `ldb`, `sz` is increased by 2.**

In this output state, the value of `sz` has been increased by 2. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The program continues to the next iteration if `sz` is less than `k`, otherwise, it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
