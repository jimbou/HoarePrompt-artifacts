Output State: **T is greater than 2, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, i is equal to n, ldb is a list containing all the values of lft that are equal to the previous value, rdb is a list containing all the values of rgt that are equal to the previous value, sng is a list containing all the values of lft that are not equal to the previous value and the next value, elem is undefined, sz is equal to 0.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their initial values except for sz, which is now set to 0. The rest of the variables and stdin remain unchanged.
