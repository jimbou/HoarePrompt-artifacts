To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 5 * 10^4 inclusive.

To execute the loop again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. The value of `n` remains the same, but we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`T` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer greater than 3 and less than or equal to 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is 3, `ldb` is a list containing all the values of `lft` that are equal to the previous value, `sng` is a list containing all the values of `lft` that are not equal to the previous value and the next value, `elem` is undefined, `sz` is equal to `k`. If `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, then `rdb` is a list containing the current value of `rgt[i]` and the previous value of `rgt[i]`.**
