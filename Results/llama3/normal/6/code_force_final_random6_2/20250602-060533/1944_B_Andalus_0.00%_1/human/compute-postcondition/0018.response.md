Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer greater than 3 and between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` is a list containing the current value of `lft[i]`, `rdb` is an empty list, and `sng` is a list containing one integer which is equal to `lft[i]`. Otherwise, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, and if `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` is a list containing one integer which is equal to `lft[i]`. Otherwise, `sng` is a list containing one integer which is equal to `lft[i]`. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `i` is 3. Otherwise, if `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `i` is 4. Otherwise, `i` is 3.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `sng` now contains one integer which is equal to `lft[i]`. This is because the code `sng.append(lft[i])` adds the current value of `lft[i]` to the end of the list `sng`. The other variables remain unchanged.
