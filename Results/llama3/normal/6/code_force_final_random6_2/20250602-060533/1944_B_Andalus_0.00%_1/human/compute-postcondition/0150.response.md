Output State: **T is greater than 1, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, i is equal to n, sz is equal to k or the number of pairs of duplicate elements in rgt that are printed, whichever is smaller plus the number of elements in sng, ldb is a list containing all the duplicate elements in lft, rdb is an empty list, and sng is a list containing all the single elements in lft.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop iterates from 1 to n-1. In each iteration, it checks if the current element in lft is equal to the previous element. If it is, the current element is added to the list ldb. If it is not, and the current element is not equal to the next element, the current element is added to the list sng. The variable sz is updated to be the minimum of k and the number of pairs of duplicate elements in rgt that are printed, plus the number of elements in sng. After the loop finishes, ldb contains all the duplicate elements in lft, sng contains all the single elements in lft, and sz is the minimum of k and the number of pairs of duplicate elements in rgt that are printed, plus the number of elements in sng. The other variables remain unchanged.
