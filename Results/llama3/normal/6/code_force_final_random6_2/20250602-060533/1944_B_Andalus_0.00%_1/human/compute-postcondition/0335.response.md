Output State: **T is greater than 2, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least one value that is not equal to the previous value and the next value, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, i is equal to n, ldb is a list containing all the values of lft that are equal to the previous value, rdb is a list containing all the values of rgt that are equal to the previous value, sng is an empty list, elem is the last element in sng, and sz is 0, and nothing is printed**

In this output state, the value of sz has been updated to 0, while all other variables remain unchanged. The value of sz was previously increased by the length of sng, but since sng is an empty list, sz is now 0. All other variables retain their original values and properties as specified in the initial state.
