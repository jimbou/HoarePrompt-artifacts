The only object in the loop head is variable  elem and list sng, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list sng.  If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, sng has at least 2 elements, elem is the second element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the elem is the third element in the list.
State: **`T` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is equal to `n`, `ldb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements in `lft`, `rdb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements in `rgt` that must have at least `floor(k/2)` elements, `sng` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `elem` is the third element in the list `sng`, `sz` is increased by 1**
