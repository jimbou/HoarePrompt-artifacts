Output State: **`T` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least one value that is not equal to the previous value and the next value, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is equal to n, `ldb` is a list containing all the values of `lft` that are equal to the previous value, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` must have at least 3 elements, and the third element in `sng` which is `elem` is to be printed, `sz` is increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only difference being that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on the variables are still satisfied.
