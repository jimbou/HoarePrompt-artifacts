Output State: `T` is greater than 0, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the values of `lft[i]` where `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, `rdb` is a list containing all the values of `rgt[i]` where `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, `sng` is a list containing all the values of `lft[i]`, `elem` is the last element in the list, `i` is equal to `n`, and `sz` is equal to `k` or the number of pairs of duplicate elements in `rgt` that are printed, whichever is smaller plus the number of iterations of the loop.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated over all the elements in the `sng` list, printing each element and incrementing the `sz` variable until it reaches `k` or the number of pairs of duplicate elements in `rgt`, whichever is smaller. The loop then breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the final state of the variables is as described above.
