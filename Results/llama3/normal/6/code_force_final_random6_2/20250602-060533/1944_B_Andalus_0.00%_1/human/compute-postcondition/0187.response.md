To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `elem` and `sng`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `sng`. If the list `sng` has at least 1 single element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the state of `sng` is a list containing all the single elements in `lft`, but it does not guarantee that the loop will execute. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `sng` to have at least 1 single element and `elem` is the first single element in the list `sng`.

State: **`T` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is equal to `n`, `sz` is equal to the minimum of `k` and 2 times the length of `ldb`, `ldb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements in `lft`, `rdb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements in `rgt`, `sng` is a list containing all the single elements in `lft` that must have at least 1 single element, `elem` is the first single element in the list `sng`**
