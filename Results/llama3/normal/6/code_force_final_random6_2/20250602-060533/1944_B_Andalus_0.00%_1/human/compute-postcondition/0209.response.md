Output State: **T is greater than 1, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, i is equal to n, sz is equal to 0, ldb is a list containing all the duplicate elements in lft, rdb is a list containing all the duplicate elements in rgt, sng is an empty list, and nothing is printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of sz is now 0, while all other variables retain their original values and properties. The input stream still contains multiple test cases minus 2, and no output has been printed.
