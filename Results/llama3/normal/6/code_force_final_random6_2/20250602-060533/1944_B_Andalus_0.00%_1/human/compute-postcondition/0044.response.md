To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `elem` and `ldb`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `ldb`. If `ldb` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `ldb` must have at least 1 element. For the loop to execute one more time, `ldb` must have at least 2 elements, and `elem` must be the second element in the list.

State: **T is greater than 0, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing all the values of lft[i] where lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1] and must have at least 2 elements, rdb is a list containing all the values of rgt[i] where rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], sng is a list containing all the values of lft[i] where i is less than n - 1 and lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], i is equal to n, and the current value of sz is either greater than or equal to k, in which case we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or sz is less than k. Additionally, if the difference between k and sz is greater than or equal to 2, then "elem elem" is printed (where elem is an element of the list) and sz is increased by 2, and elem is the second element in the list ldb**
