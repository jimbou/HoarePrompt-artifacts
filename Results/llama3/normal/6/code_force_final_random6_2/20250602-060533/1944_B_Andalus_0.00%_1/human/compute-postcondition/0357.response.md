Output State: **T is greater than 2, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least one value that is not equal to the previous value and the next value, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, i is equal to n, ldb is a list containing all the values of lft that are equal to the previous value, rdb is a list containing all the values of rgt that are equal to the previous value and must have at least 3 elements, sng is an empty list, sz is increased by 2, and the third element in rdb which is elem is printed twice with a space in between, elem is printed.**

In this output state, the value of sz has been increased by 2. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The third element in rdb, which is elem, is printed twice with a space in between, and elem is also printed. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2.
