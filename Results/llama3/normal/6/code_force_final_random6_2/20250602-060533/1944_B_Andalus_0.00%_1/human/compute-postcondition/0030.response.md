Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer greater than 3 and less than or equal to 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the values of `lft[i]` where `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, `rdb` is a list containing the value of `rgt[i]` if `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, otherwise `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing all the values of `lft[i]` where `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, and `i` is 3. `rdb` has an additional element which is `rgt[2]`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `rdb` now has an additional element, which is the value of `rgt[2]`, because `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]` when `i` is 3.
