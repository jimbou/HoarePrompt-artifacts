Output State: **T is greater than 1, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, i is equal to n, sz is equal to the minimum of k and 2 times the length of ldb plus the length of sng, ldb is a list containing all the duplicate elements in lft, rdb is a list containing all the duplicate elements in rgt, sng is an empty list, and all the single elements in the list sng are printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has printed all the single elements in the list `sng` and the value of `sz` has been updated to be the minimum of `k` and 2 times the length of `ldb` plus the length of `sng`. The loop has terminated because the condition `sz >= k` has been met or the list `sng` has been exhausted. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
