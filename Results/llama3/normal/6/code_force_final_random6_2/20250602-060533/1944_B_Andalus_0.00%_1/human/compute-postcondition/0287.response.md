Output State: **T is greater than 2, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, i is equal to n, ldb is a list containing all the values of lft that are equal to the previous value, rdb is a list containing all the values of rgt that are equal to the previous value, sng is a list containing all the values of lft that are not equal to the previous value and the next value, elem is undefined, sz is equal to k.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop variable `i` has reached the value of `n`, and the list `rdb` now contains all the values of `rgt` that are equal to the previous value. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial state.
