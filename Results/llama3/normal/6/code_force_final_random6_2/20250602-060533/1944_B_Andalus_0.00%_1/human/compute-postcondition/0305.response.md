The only variable in the loop head is variable `elem` and list `ldb`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `ldb`. If `ldb` has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `ldb` has at least two elements, `elem` is the second element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the `elem` is the third element in the list.
State: **`T` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least two values equal to the previous value, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is equal to n, `ldb` is a list containing all the values of `lft` that are equal to the previous value and must have at least three elements, `rdb` is a list containing all the values of `rgt` that are equal to the previous value, `sng` is a list containing all the values of `lft` that are not equal to the previous value and the next value, `elem` is the third element in `ldb`.**
