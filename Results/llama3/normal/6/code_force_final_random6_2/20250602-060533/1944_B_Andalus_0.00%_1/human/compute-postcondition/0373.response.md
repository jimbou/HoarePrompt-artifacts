To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again. The loop head is `for elem in sng:`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, we know that `sng` must have at least 2 elements, and the second element `elem` has been processed (printed). For the loop to execute again, `sng` must have at least 3 elements, and the next element to be processed should be the third element.

The only variable in the loop head that needs to be adjusted is `elem`, which should now refer to the third element of `sng`. The other variables in the state, such as `T`, `_`, `stdin`, `n`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `i`, `ldb`, `rdb`, `sz`, and `k`, are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`T` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least one value that is not equal to the previous value and the next value, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is equal to n, `ldb` is a list containing all the values of `lft` that are equal to the previous value, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` must have at least 3 elements, and the third element in `sng` which is `elem` is to be printed, `sz` is increased by 1, and if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement**
