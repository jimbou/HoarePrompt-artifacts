The only variable in the loop head is `elem` and `sng`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `sng`. If `sng` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `sng` is an empty list, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `sng` must have at least 1 element and `elem` is the first element in `sng`.
