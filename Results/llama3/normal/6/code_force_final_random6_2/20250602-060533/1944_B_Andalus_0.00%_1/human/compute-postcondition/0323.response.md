Based on the precondition, the print statement will print the second element in the list `sng`, which contains all the values of `lft` that are not equal to the previous value and the next value.

Since `sng` must have at least 2 values, the second element `elem` is a valid index. The value of `elem` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive.

The `end=' '` argument in the print statement means that a space will be printed after the value of `elem`, instead of a newline character.

Output: **[value of elem] (where elem is the second element in the list sng, which is an integer between 1 and n inclusive)**
