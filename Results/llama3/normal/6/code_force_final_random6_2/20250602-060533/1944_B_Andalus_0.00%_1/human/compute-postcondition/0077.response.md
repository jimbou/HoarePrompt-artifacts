Output: **T is greater than 0, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing all the values of lft[i] where lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], rdb is a list containing all the values of rgt[i] where rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], sng is a list containing all the values of lft[i] where i is less than n - 1 and lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1] and must have at least 3 elements, elem is the third element in the list, i is equal to n, and sz is equal to k or the maximum value that is less than k and is a multiple of 2 plus 1 plus 1. If sz is greater than or equal to k, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the third element of the list sng which is elem is printed**
