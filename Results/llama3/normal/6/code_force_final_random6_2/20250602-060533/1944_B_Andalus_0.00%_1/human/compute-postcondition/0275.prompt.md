Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is greater than 2, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, i is equal to n, ldb is an empty list, rdb is an empty list, sng is an empty list, elem is undefined, sz is equal to k.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if lft[i] == lft[i - 1]:
        ldb.append(lft[i])
    elif i < n - 1 and lft[i] != lft[i + 1]:
        sng.append(lft[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`T` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is less than `n`, if `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` is a list containing the value of `lft[i]`, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, `elem` is undefined, `sz` is equal to `k`. If `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, if `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` is a list containing `lft[i]`. Otherwise, `sng` is an empty list, `elem` is undefined, `sz` is equal to `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`T` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is less than `n`. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` is a list containing the value of `lft[i]`, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, `elem` is undefined, `sz` is equal to `k`. If `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing `lft[i]` if `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `sng` is a list containing `lft[i]`, `elem` is undefined, `sz` is equal to `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`T` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is less than `n` and `i` is not equal to `n`. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` is a list containing the value of `lft[i]` and `lft[i - 1]`, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, `elem` is undefined, `sz` is equal to `k`. If `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing `lft[i]`, `elem` is undefined, `sz` is equal to `k`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
