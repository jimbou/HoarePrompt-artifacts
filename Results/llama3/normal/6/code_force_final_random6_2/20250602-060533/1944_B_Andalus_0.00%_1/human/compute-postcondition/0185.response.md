Postcondition: ***T is greater than 1, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, i is equal to n, sz is equal to 4 if k - sz >= 0, otherwise sz remains the same, ldb is a list containing all the duplicate elements in lft that must have at least 3 elements, rdb is a list containing all the duplicate elements in rgt, sng is a list containing all the single elements in lft, and elem is the third element in ldb. If k - sz >= 2, then sz is equal to 6 if k - sz + 2 >= 0, otherwise sz remains the same, and the third element in ldb which is elem is printed twice, separated by a space. If sz is greater than or equal to k, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
