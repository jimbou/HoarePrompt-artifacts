Output State: **T is greater than 2, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, i is equal to n, ldb is a list containing all the values of lft that are equal to the previous value, rdb is an empty list, sng is a list containing all the values of lft that are not equal to the previous value and the next value, elem is undefined, sz is equal to k.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

* The loop has finished executing, and the value of `i` is now equal to `n`.
* The list `ldb` contains all the values of `lft` that are equal to the previous value.
* The list `sng` contains all the values of `lft` that are not equal to the previous value and the next value.
* The other variables remain unchanged, with `T` still greater than 2, `_` still equal to 2, `stdin` still containing multiple test cases minus 2, `n` still an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` still a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` still a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` still a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rdb` still an empty list, `elem` still undefined, and `sz` still equal to `k`.
