Output State: **`T` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least one value that is not equal to the previous value and the next value, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is equal to n, `ldb` is a list containing all the values of `lft` that are equal to the previous value, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` must have at least 3 elements, `sz` is increased by 1, and if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise the program continues to execute, and the third element of `sng` which is `elem` is printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `sz` is increased by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The program continues to execute if `sz` is less than `k`, otherwise, it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The third element of `sng`, which is `elem`, is printed.
