Output State: **T is greater than 0, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is an empty list, rdb is an empty list, sng is an empty list.**

The code reads two lines from stdin for a test case, parses the input into integers, and assigns them to variables. The first line assigns the values of `n` and `k` from the input to the corresponding variables. The second line assigns the list of `2n` integers from the input to the variable `lst`. The code then splits `lst` into two halves, `lft` and `rgt`, each containing `n` integers, and sorts them in ascending order. The variables `ldb`, `rdb`, and `sng` are initialized as empty lists. The value of `T` and `_` remains unchanged. Stdin now contains one less test case.
