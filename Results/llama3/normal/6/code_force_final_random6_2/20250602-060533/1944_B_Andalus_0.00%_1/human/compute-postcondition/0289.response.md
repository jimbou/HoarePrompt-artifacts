To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `elem` and `ldb`. The loop will execute if `ldb` has at least one element. Since `ldb` contains all the values of `lft` that are equal to the previous value, we need to adjust the state of `lft` to ensure it has at least one such value.

State: **T is greater than 2, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least one value equal to the previous value, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, i is equal to n, ldb is a list containing all the values of lft that are equal to the previous value and must have at least one element, rdb is a list containing all the values of rgt that are equal to the previous value, sng is a list containing all the values of lft that are not equal to the previous value and the next value, elem is the first element in ldb, sz is equal to 0**
