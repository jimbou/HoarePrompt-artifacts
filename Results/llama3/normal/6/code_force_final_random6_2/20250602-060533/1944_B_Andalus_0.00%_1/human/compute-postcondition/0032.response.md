Output State: `T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the values of `lft[i]` where `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, `rdb` is a list containing all the values of `rgt[i]` where `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, `sng` is a list containing all the values of `lft[i]` where `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, and `i` is `n`.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the value of `i` which is now equal to `n`, and the list `rdb` which now contains all the values of `rgt[i]` where `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`. This means that the loop has iterated over all the elements of the list `rgt` and has added all the duplicate values to the list `rdb`.
