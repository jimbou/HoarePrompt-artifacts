Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is 1, and `sz` is equal to `k` or the number of pairs of duplicate elements in `rgt` that are printed, whichever is smaller plus the number of elements in `sng`. If the current value of `lft[i]` is equal to the current value of `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` is a list containing the value of `lft[1]`, `rdb` is an empty list, and `sng` is an empty list. Otherwise, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, and `sng` is a list containing the element at index `i` in `lft` if `i` is less than `n - 1` and the element at index `i` in `lft` is not equal to the element at index `i + 1` in `lft`, otherwise `sng` is an empty list.***
