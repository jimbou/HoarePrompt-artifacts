Output State: **T is equal to 0, _ is equal to T, stdin contains no test cases, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing all the values of lft that are equal to the previous value, rdb is a list containing all the values of rgt that are equal to the previous value, sng is a list containing all the values of lft that are not equal to the previous value and the next value, elem is the last element in the list sng, i is equal to n, and sz is equal to k.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing all the test cases in the input. The loop counter `_` is equal to the total number of test cases `T`, and there are no more test cases left in the input. The variables `n`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, `rdb`, `sng`, `elem`, `i`, and `sz` retain their last values after the loop finishes executing.
