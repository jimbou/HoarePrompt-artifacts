To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `elem` and `sng`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `sng`. If `sng` has at least one element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `sng` has at least 1 element, and the first element `elem` is printed followed by a space.

For the loop to execute again, `sng` must have at least one more element, and `elem` must be the next element in the list. Since the first element `elem` is already printed, the next element in the list will be the second element.

State: **`T` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least one value that is not equal to the previous value and the next value, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is equal to n, `ldb` is a list containing all the values of `lft` that are equal to the previous value, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` must have at least 2 elements, and the second element in `sng` which is `elem` is to be printed, `sz` is increased by 1**
