Output State: T is greater than 0, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing all the values of lft[i] where lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], rdb is a list containing all the values of rgt[i] where rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], sng is a list containing all the values of lft[i] where i is less than n - 1 and lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], i is equal to n, and sz is either equal to k or the length of ldb multiplied by 2.

The loop will continue to execute until either `sz` is greater than or equal to `k` or all elements in `ldb` have been processed. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, the loop will print each element in `ldb` twice, separated by a space, and increment `sz` by 2. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop will break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If all elements in `ldb` have been processed, `sz` will be equal to the length of `ldb` multiplied by 2.
