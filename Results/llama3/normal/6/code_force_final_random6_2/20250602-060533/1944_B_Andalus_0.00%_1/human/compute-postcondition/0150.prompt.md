Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is greater than 1, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is an empty list, rdb is an empty list, sng is an empty list, elem is the last element in the list, i is equal to n, and sz is equal to k or the number of pairs of duplicate elements in rgt that are printed, whichever is smaller plus the number of elements in sng.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if lft[i] == lft[i - 1]:
        ldb.append(lft[i])
    elif i < n - 1 and lft[i] != lft[i + 1]:
        sng.append(lft[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`T` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is 1, and `sz` is equal to `k` or the number of pairs of duplicate elements in `rgt` that are printed, whichever is smaller plus the number of elements in `sng`. If the current value of `lft[i]` is equal to the current value of `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` is a list containing the value of `lft[1]`, `rdb` is an empty list, and `sng` is an empty list. Otherwise, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, and `sng` is a list containing the element at index `i` in `lft` if `i` is less than `n - 1` and the element at index `i` in `lft` is not equal to the element at index `i + 1` in `lft`, otherwise `sng` is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`T` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is 2. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `sz` is equal to `k` or the number of pairs of duplicate elements in `rgt` that are printed, whichever is smaller plus the number of elements in `sng`, `ldb` is a list containing the value of `lft[1]` and `lft[i]`, `rdb` is an empty list, and `sng` is an empty list if `i` is equal to `n - 1` or the element at index `i` in `lft` is equal to the element at index `i + 1` in `lft`, otherwise `sng` is a list containing the element at index `i` in `lft`. If `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then if `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, `sz` is equal to `k` or the number of pairs of duplicate elements in `rgt` that are printed, whichever is smaller plus the number of elements in `sng` plus one, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, and `sng` is a list containing the element at index `i` in `lft`. Otherwise, `sz` is equal to `k` or the number of pairs of duplicate elements in `rgt` that are printed, whichever is smaller plus the number of elements in `sng`, `ldb` is a list containing the value of `lft[1]`, `rdb` is an empty list, and `sng` is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`T` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is 3, `sz` is unknown, `ldb` is a list containing the 4th element of `lft` if the 4th element of `lft` is equal to the 3rd element of `lft`, otherwise `ldb` is unknown. If `i` is less than `n - 1` and the fourth element of `lft` is different from the fifth element of `lft`, then `sng` contains one more element which is the fourth element of `lft`, otherwise `sng` is unknown. `rdb` is unknown.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
