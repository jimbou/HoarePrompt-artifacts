Output State: **`T` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least one value that is not equal to the previous value and the next value, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is equal to n, `ldb` is a list containing all the values of `lft` that are equal to the previous value, `rdb` is a list containing all the values of `rgt` that are equal to the previous value and must have at least one element, `sng` is an empty list, `elem` is the first element in `rdb`, and `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code `break` only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, but does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, all the variables retain their original values and properties. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
