Output: **T is greater than 2, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least two values equal to the previous value, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, i is equal to n, ldb is a list containing all the values of lft that are equal to the previous value and must have at least three elements, rdb is a list containing all the values of rgt that are equal to the previous value, sng is a list containing all the values of lft that are not equal to the previous value and the next value, elem is the third element in ldb. If sz is greater than or equal to k, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the third element of ldb which is equal to elem is printed twice with a space in between.**
