To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 2 (since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`). 

Since `i` is equal to `n` before the loop starts, we need to adjust its value to be 1, so that the loop can start executing. 

The other variables and their states are not relevant to the loop execution, so we don't need to adjust them.

State: **`T` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, `elem` is the last element in the list, `i` is 1, and `sz` is equal to `k` or the number of pairs of duplicate elements in `rgt` that are printed, whichever is smaller plus the number of elements in `sng`.**
