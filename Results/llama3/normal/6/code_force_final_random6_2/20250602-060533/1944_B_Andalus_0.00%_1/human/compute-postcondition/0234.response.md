The only variable in the loop head is variable `elem` and `sng`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `sng`. If `sng` is not empty the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `sng` is an empty list. So for the loop to be executed  the list `sng` must have at least 1 element and `elem` is the first element in the list `sng`.
State: **`T` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is equal to `n`, `ldb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements in `lft`, `rdb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements in `rgt` that must have at least `floor(k/2)` elements, `sng` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `elem` is the first element in the list `sng`, `sz` is equal to `k` if `k` is even or `k - 1` if `k` is odd**
