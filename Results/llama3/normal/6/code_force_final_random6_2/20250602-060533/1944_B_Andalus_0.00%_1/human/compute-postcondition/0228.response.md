Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is equal to `n`, `ldb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements in `lft`, `rdb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements in `rgt` that must have at least 3 elements, `sng` is an empty list, `elem` is the third element in the list `rdb`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
