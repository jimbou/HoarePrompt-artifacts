Output State: *T is greater than 2, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, i is equal to n, ldb is a list containing all the values of lft that are equal to the previous value, sng is a list containing all the values of lft that are not equal to the previous value and the next value, elem is undefined, sz is equal to k. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rdb is a list containing all the values of rgt that are equal to the previous value.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the variable i, which is now equal to n, and the list rdb, which contains all the values of rgt that are equal to the previous value.
