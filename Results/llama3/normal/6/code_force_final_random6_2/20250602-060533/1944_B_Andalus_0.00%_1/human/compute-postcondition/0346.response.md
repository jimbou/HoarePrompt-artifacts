Output State: **`T` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least one value that is not equal to the previous value and the next value, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is equal to n, `ldb` is a list containing all the values of `lft` that are equal to the previous value, `rdb` is a list containing all the values of `rgt` that are equal to the previous value and must have at least 2 elements, `sng` is an empty list, `elem` is the second element in `rdb`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. This means that the execution of the program will continue from the next statement outside the loop or if statement that the break statement is directly inside.
