Output State: **T is greater than 1, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, i is equal to n, sz is equal to 2, ldb is a list containing all the duplicate elements in lft that must have at least 1 element, rdb is a list containing all the duplicate elements in rgt, sng is a list containing all the single elements in lft, and elem is the first element in ldb. The current value of sz is less than k minus 2, and the first element of ldb which is elem is printed twice with a space in between.**

In this output state, the value of sz has been incremented by 2, and the rest of the variables remain unchanged. The value of sz is now 2, and it is still less than k minus 2. The first element of ldb, which is elem, has been printed twice with a space in between. The rest of the variables, including T, _, stdin, n, k, lst, lft, rgt, i, ldb, rdb, and sng, retain their original values and properties.
