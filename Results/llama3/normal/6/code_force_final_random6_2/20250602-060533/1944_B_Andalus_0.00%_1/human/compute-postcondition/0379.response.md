Output State: **T is greater than 2, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least one value that is not equal to the previous value and the next value, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, i is equal to n, ldb is a list containing all the values of lft that are equal to the previous value, rdb is an empty list, sng is empty, elem is the last element in rdb, and sz is equal to k.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing and the program has moved on to the next part of the code. The loop has printed all the elements in the list `sng` that were present when the loop started, and the variable `sz` has been incremented by the number of elements printed. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop has broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. The state of the other variables in the precondition remains unchanged.
