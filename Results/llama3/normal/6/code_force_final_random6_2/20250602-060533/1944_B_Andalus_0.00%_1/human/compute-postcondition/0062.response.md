Output State: **T is greater than 0, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing all the values of lft[i] where lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], rdb is a list containing all the values of rgt[i] where rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], sng is a list containing all the values of lft[i] where i is less than n - 1 and lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1] and must have at least 1 element, elem is the first element in the list, i is equal to n, and sz is equal to k or the maximum value that is less than k and is a multiple of 2. The current value of sz is greater than or equal to k, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The break statement does not change the values of any variables, but it causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional statement it is currently inside. All variables retain their previous values, and the program continues executing from the next statement outside the loop or conditional statement.
