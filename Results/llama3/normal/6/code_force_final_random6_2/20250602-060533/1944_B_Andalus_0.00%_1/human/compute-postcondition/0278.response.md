Output State: **`T` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is 1, `ldb` is a list containing all the values of `lft` that are equal to the previous value, `rdb` is a list containing the current value of `rgt[i]`, `sng` is a list containing all the values of `lft` that are not equal to the previous value and the next value, `elem` is undefined, `sz` is equal to `k`. The current value of `rgt[i]` is equal to the current value of `rgt[i - 1]`.**

In this output state, the only change is that `rdb` is no longer an empty list, but now contains the current value of `rgt[i]`, which is equal to the current value of `rgt[i - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
