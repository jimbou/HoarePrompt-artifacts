Output State: **T is greater than 0, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing all the values of lft[i] where lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], rdb is an empty list, sng is a list containing all the values of lft[i] where i is less than n - 1 and lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], and i is equal to n.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated over the entire list `lft` and has populated the lists `ldb` and `sng` accordingly. The list `ldb` contains all the values of `lft[i]` where `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, and the list `sng` contains all the values of `lft[i]` where `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`. The loop has also updated the value of `i` to be equal to `n`, indicating that it has completed all the iterations. The other variables in the precondition remain unchanged.
