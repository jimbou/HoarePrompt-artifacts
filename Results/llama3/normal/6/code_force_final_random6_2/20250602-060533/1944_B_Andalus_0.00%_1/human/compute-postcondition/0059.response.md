Output State: T is greater than 0, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing all the values of lft[i] where lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], rdb is a list containing all the values of rgt[i] where rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], sng is a list containing all the values of lft[i] where i is less than n - 1 and lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], i is equal to n, and sz is equal to k or the maximum value that is less than k and is a multiple of 2.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop will continue to iterate over the list `ldb` and print pairs of elements as long as `sz` is less than `k` and `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2. Once `sz` is greater than or equal to `k` or `k - sz` is less than 2, the loop will break. The final value of `sz` will be either `k` or the maximum value less than `k` that is a multiple of 2.
