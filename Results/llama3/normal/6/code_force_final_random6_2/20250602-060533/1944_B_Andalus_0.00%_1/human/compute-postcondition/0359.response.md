Output State: **T is greater than 2, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least one value that is not equal to the previous value and the next value, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, i is equal to n, ldb is a list containing all the values of lft that are equal to the previous value, rdb is an empty list, sng is an empty list, elem is the last element in rdb, and sz is equal to k.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that all the variables that were not affected by the loop head and body remain unchanged. The loop head and body only affected the variables elem, rdb, and sz. After the loop executes all the iterations, elem is the last element in rdb, rdb is an empty list, and sz is equal to k.
