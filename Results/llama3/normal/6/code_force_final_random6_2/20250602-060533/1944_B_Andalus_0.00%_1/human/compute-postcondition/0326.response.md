To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for elem in sng:`. Therefore, we can only adjust the states of `elem` and `sng`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `sng`. If the list `sng` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `sng` has at least 2 values, `elem` is the second element in `sng`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `sng` must have at least 3 values, and `elem` must be the third element in `sng`.

State: **`T` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least one value that is not equal to the previous value and the next value, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is equal to n, `ldb` is a list containing all the values of lft that are equal to the previous value, `rdb` is a list containing all the values of rgt that are equal to the previous value, `sng` is a list containing all the values of lft that are not equal to the previous value and the next value that must have at least 3 values, `elem` is the third element in sng, and `sz` is increased by 1**
