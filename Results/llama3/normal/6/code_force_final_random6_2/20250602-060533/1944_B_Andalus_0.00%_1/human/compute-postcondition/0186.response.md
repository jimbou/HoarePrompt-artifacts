Output State: **T is greater than 1, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, i is equal to n, sz is equal to the minimum of k and 2 times the length of ldb, ldb is a list containing all the duplicate elements in lft, rdb is a list containing all the duplicate elements in rgt, sng is a list containing all the single elements in lft, and elem is the last element in ldb. If sz is less than k, then the last element in ldb which is elem is printed twice, separated by a space, otherwise no action is taken.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop will continue to execute until it has processed all elements in the list `ldb` or until `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `sz` is less than `k`, the last element in `ldb` will be printed twice, separated by a space. The value of `sz` will be the minimum of `k` and twice the length of `ldb`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
