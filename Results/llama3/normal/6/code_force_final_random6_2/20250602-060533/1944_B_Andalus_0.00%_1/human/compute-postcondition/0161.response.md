Output State: **T is greater than 1, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, i is equal to n, sz is equal to k or the number of pairs of duplicate elements in rgt that are printed, whichever is smaller plus the number of elements in sng, ldb is a list containing all the duplicate elements in lft, rdb is a list containing all the duplicate elements in rgt, and sng is a list containing all the single elements in lft.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated over the entire list `rgt` and has identified all the duplicate elements in `rgt` and stored them in `rdb`. The loop has also kept track of the number of pairs of duplicate elements in `rgt` that are printed, which is stored in `sz`. The other variables remain unchanged.
