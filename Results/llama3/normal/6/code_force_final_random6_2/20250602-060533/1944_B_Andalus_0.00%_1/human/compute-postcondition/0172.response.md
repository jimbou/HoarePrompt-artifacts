The only variable in the loop head is variable `elem` and list `ldb`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `ldb`. If `ldb` has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `ldb` has at least 1 element, `elem` is the first element in `ldb`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list `ldb` must have at least 2 elements and `elem` is the second element in the list `ldb`.
State: **`T` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is equal to n, `sz` is equal to 2 if k - sz >= 2, otherwise sz remains the same, `ldb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements in lft that must have at least 2 elements, `rdb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements in rgt, `sng` is a list containing all the single elements in lft, and `elem` is the second element in ldb.**
