The code prints the third element in the list `ldb` twice, separated by a space, without appending a newline character at the end.

Since `ldb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements in `lft` that must have at least 3 elements, the third element in `ldb` is a duplicate element in `lft`.

Output: **[third element in ldb] [third element in ldb]**
