Output State: **T is greater than 1, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, i is equal to n, sz is equal to 6 if k - sz + 2 >= 0, otherwise sz remains the same, ldb is a list containing all the duplicate elements in lft that must have at least 3 elements, rdb is a list containing all the duplicate elements in rgt, sng is a list containing all the single elements in lft, and elem is the third element in ldb. If sz is greater than or equal to k, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken, and the third element in ldb which is elem is printed twice, separated by a space.**

In this output state, the value of sz has been incremented by 2. If k is greater than or equal to sz, the program will break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the third element in ldb, which is elem, will be printed twice, separated by a space. All other variables remain unchanged.
