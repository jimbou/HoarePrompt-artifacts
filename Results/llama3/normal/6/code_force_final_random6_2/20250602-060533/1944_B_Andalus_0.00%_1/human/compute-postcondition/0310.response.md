Output State: **T is greater than 2, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least two values equal to the previous value, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, i is equal to n, ldb is a list containing all the values of lft that are equal to the previous value and must have at least three elements, rdb is a list containing all the values of rgt that are equal to the previous value, sng is a list containing all the values of lft that are not equal to the previous value and the next value, elem is the third element in ldb, sz is increased by 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of sz is increased by 2. All other variables remain unchanged. The program still has multiple test cases to process, and the lists lft, rgt, ldb, rdb, and sng maintain their properties. The value of elem is still the third element in ldb.
