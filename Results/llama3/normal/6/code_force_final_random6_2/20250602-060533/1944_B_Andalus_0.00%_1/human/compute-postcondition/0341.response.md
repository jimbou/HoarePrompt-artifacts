Based on the precondition, we can determine the output of the print statement as follows:

The print statement prints the value of `elem` twice, separated by a space, without appending a newline character at the end.

`elem` is the first element in the list `rdb`, which contains all the values of `rgt` that are equal to the previous value. Since `rdb` must have at least one element, `elem` is a valid value.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `elem` printed twice, separated by a space.

Output: **[elem] [elem] (where elem is the first element in the list rdb)**
