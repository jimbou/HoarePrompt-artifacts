The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `T`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `T`. If `_` is less than `T`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0 and `T` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `T` must be greater than 1.
State: **`T` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the values of `lft[i]` where `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, `rdb` is a list containing all the values of `rgt[i]` where `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, `sng` is a list containing all the values of `lft[i]`, `elem` is the last element in the list, `i` is equal to `n`, and `sz` is equal to `k` or the number of pairs of duplicate elements in `rgt` that are printed, whichever is smaller plus the number of elements in `sng`.**
