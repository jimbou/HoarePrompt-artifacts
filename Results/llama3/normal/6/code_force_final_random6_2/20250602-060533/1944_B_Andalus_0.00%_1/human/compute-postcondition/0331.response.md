Output State: **`T` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least one value that is not equal to the previous value and the next value, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is equal to n, `ldb` is a list containing all the values of lft that are equal to the previous value, `rdb` is a list containing all the values of rgt that are equal to the previous value, `sng` is a list containing all the values of lft that are not equal to the previous value and the next value that must have at least 3 values, `elem` is the third element in sng, and `sz` is increased by 2. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the third element of the list sng which is elem is printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `sz` has been increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The program still has multiple test cases to process, and the lists `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, `rdb`, and `sng` maintain their properties. The value of `elem` is still the third element in `sng`. If the new value of `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program will break out of the innermost loop or if statement and print the value of `elem`.
