To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects within it. The loop head is `for elem in sng:`.

The only object in the loop head is `elem` and the list `sng`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `sng`. If the list `sng` has at least one more element, the loop executes again.

At the end of the last iteration, `sng` has at least 1 element, and `elem` is the first element in the list. For the loop to execute one more time, the list `sng` must have at least one more element, and `elem` must be the next element in the list.

State: **`T` is greater than 0, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the values of `lft[i]` where `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, `rdb` is a list containing all the values of `rgt[i]` where `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, `sng` is a list containing all the values of `lft[i]` that must have at least 2 elements, `elem` is the second element in the list, `i` is equal to `n`, and `sz` is equal to `k` or the number of pairs of duplicate elements in `rgt` that are printed, whichever is smaller plus one.**
