To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for elem in sng:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `elem` and `sng`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `sng` has at least one more element. At the end of the previous iteration, `sng` has at least 2 elements, and `elem` is the second element in the list.

For the loop to execute again, `sng` must have at least 3 elements, and `elem` must be the third element in the list.

State: **T is greater than 0, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing all the values of lft[i] where lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], rdb is a list containing all the values of rgt[i] where rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], sng is a list containing all the values of lft[i] where i is less than n - 1 and lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1] and must have at least 3 elements, elem is the third element in the list, i is equal to n, and sz is equal to k or the maximum value that is less than k and is a multiple of 2 plus 1 plus 1.**
