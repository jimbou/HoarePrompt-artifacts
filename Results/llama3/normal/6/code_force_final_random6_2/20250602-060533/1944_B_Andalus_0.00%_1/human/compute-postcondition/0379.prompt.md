Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is greater than 2, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least one value that is not equal to the previous value and the next value, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, i is equal to n, ldb is a list containing all the values of lft that are equal to the previous value, rdb is an empty list, sng is an empty list, elem is the last element in rdb, and sz is equal to k.
Code of the loop:
for elem in sng:
    if sz >= k:
        break
    print(elem, end=' ')
    sz += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: T is greater than 2, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least one value that is not equal to the previous value and the next value, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, i is equal to n, ldb is a list containing all the values of lft that are equal to the previous value, rdb is an empty list, sng must have at least 1 element, and the first element in sng which is elem is printed followed by a space, sz is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `T` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least one value that is not equal to the previous value and the next value, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is equal to n, `ldb` is a list containing all the values of `lft` that are equal to the previous value, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` must have at least 2 elements, and the second element in `sng` which is `elem` is printed, `sz` is increased by 1, and if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the second element of `sng` which is `elem` is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `T` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least one value that is not equal to the previous value and the next value, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is equal to n, `ldb` is a list containing all the values of `lft` that are equal to the previous value, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` must have at least 3 elements, `sz` is increased by 1, and if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise the program continues to execute, and the third element of `sng` which is `elem` is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
