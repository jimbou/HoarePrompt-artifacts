Output State: **`T` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is equal to `n`, `ldb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements in `lft`, `rdb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements in `rgt` that must have at least 3 elements, `sng` is an empty list, `elem` is the third element in the list `rdb`, `sz` is increased by 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `sz` is increased by 2, and all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `T` is still greater than 1, `_` is still 1, and the input buffer `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus 2. The values of `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `i`, `ldb`, `rdb`, `sng`, and `elem` remain the same as before.
