Output State: **`T` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is 3, `sz` is unknown, `ldb` is a list containing the 4th element of `lft`, `rdb` is unknown, `sng` is unknown**

In this output state, the value of `ldb` has been updated to include the 4th element of the sorted list `lft`, which is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
