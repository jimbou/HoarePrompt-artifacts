Postcondition: ***T is greater than 2, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer greater than 3 and less than or equal to 5 * 10^4 inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, i is 3, ldb is a list containing all the values of lft that are equal to the previous value, sng is a list containing all the values of lft that are not equal to the previous value and the next value, elem is undefined, sz is equal to k. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rdb is a list containing the current value of rgt[i] and the previous value of rgt[i].***
