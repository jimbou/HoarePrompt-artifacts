Reasoning: The given program is correct. It correctly identifies the pairs of identical elements in the left and right halves of the array, and then constructs the two arrays l and r by selecting elements from these pairs and the single elements in the left half. The program ensures that the bitwise XOR of the elements in l is equal to the bitwise XOR of the elements in r, as required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
