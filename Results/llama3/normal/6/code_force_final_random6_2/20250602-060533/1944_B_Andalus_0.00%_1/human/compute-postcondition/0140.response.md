To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`T` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is 2, and `sz` is equal to `k` or the number of pairs of duplicate elements in `rgt` that are printed, whichever is smaller plus the number of elements in `sng`. If the current value of `lft[i]` is equal to the current value of `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` is a list containing the value of `lft[1]`, `rdb` is an empty list, and `sng` is an empty list. Otherwise, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, and `sng` is a list containing the element at index `i` in `lft` if `i` is less than `n - 1` and the element at index `i` in `lft` is not equal to the element at index `i + 1` in `lft`, otherwise `sng` is an empty list.**
