Output State: **`T` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least one value that is not equal to the previous value and the next value, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is equal to n, `ldb` is a list containing all the values of `lft` that are equal to the previous value, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` must have at least 2 elements, and the second element in `sng` which is `elem` is to be printed, `sz` is increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code snippet only contains a `break` statement, which means it will exit the innermost loop or conditional statement it is currently in. This does not change the values of any variables, but it does change the control flow of the program. Therefore, all the variables retain their previous values, and the only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
