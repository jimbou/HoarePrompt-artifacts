Postcondition: **T is greater than 2, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least one value that is not equal to the previous value and the next value, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, i is equal to n, ldb is a list containing all the values of lft that are equal to the previous value, rdb is a list containing all the values of rgt that are equal to the previous value and must have at least 2 elements, sng is an empty list, elem is the second element in rdb. If k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, sz is increased by 2 and the second element in rdb which is equal to elem is printed twice with a space in between.**
