Postcondition: ***`ldb` has at least one more element, `elem` is the next element in the list `ldb`. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, `sz` is increased by 2 and the next element in the list `ldb` which is `elem` is printed twice, separated by a space. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
