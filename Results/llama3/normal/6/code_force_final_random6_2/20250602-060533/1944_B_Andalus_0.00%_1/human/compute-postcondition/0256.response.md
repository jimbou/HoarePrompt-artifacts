Output State: **T is greater than 2, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, i is equal to n, ldb is an empty list, rdb is an empty list, sng is an empty list, elem is undefined, sz is equal to k.**

The code snippet provided reads two integers `n` and `k` from `stdin`, followed by a list of `2n` integers, which are then split into two lists `lft` and `rgt`, each containing `n` integers. Both `lft` and `rgt` are sorted in ascending order. The lists `ldb`, `rdb`, and `sng` are initialized as empty lists. The variable `elem` is not assigned a value in this code snippet, so its value remains undefined. The variable `sz` is assigned the value of `k`. The value of `i` is not modified in this code snippet, so it remains equal to `n`. The value of `T` and `_` are not affected by this code snippet, so they retain their initial values. The number of test cases in `stdin` is reduced by 2.
