Output State: **T is greater than 2, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, i is equal to n, ldb is a list containing all the values of lft that are equal to the previous value, rdb is a list containing all the values of rgt that are equal to the previous value, sng is a list containing all the values of lft that are not equal to the previous value and the next value, elem is the last element in ldb, and sz is increased by 2 for each pair of elements in ldb that are equal to the previous value and have k - sz greater than or equal to 2.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated over all the elements in the list `ldb` that are equal to the previous value. For each pair of elements in `ldb` that are equal to the previous value and have `k - sz` greater than or equal to 2, `sz` is increased by 2. The loop has also printed all the pairs of elements in `ldb` that are equal to the previous value and have `k - sz` greater than or equal to 2. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
