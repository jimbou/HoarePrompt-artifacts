Output State: **`T` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is equal to `n`, `ldb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements in `lft`, `rdb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements in `rgt` that must have at least `floor(k/2)` elements, `sng` is an empty list, `elem` is the last element in the list `rdb` that was processed, `sz` is equal to `k` if `k` is even or `k - 1` if `k` is odd.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has processed all the elements in the list `rdb` that can be paired up to reach the target value `k`. If `k` is even, all elements in `rdb` have been processed and `sz` is equal to `k`. If `k` is odd, one element in `rdb` remains unprocessed and `sz` is equal to `k - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
