To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 2 (since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n`). 

Before the loop starts, `i` is equal to `n`, which means it is already at the end of the range. To make the loop execute, `i` should be less than `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to be less than `n`. Since the range starts from 1, we can set `i` to 1.

State: **`T` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is 1, `ldb` is a list containing all the values of `lft` that are equal to the previous value, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing all the values of `lft` that are not equal to the previous value and the next value, `elem` is undefined, `sz` is equal to `k`**
