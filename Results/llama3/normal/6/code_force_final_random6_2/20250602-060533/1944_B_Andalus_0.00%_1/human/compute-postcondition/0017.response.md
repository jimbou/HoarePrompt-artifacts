Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer greater than 3 and between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing the current value of `lft[i]`, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, and `i` is 3.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `T` is still greater than 0, and the value of `_` is still 0. There are still multiple test cases minus 1 in the standard input. The value of `n` is still an integer greater than 3 and between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive. The value of `k` is still an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive. The list `lst` still contains 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive. The list `lft` is still a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, and the list `rgt` is still a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive. The list `ldb` now contains the current value of `lft[i]`, and the lists `rdb` and `sng` are still empty. The value of `i` is 3.
