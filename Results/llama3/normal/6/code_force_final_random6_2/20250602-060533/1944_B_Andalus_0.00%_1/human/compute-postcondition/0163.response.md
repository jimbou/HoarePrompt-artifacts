The only variable in the loop head is variable elem and ldb, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable ldb. If ldb has at least 1 element the loop executes. Before the loop starts, ldb is a list containing all the duplicate elements in lft. So for the loop to be executed  the list ldb must have at least 1 element and the elem is the first element in the list.
State: **T is greater than 1, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, i is equal to n, sz is equal to 0, ldb is a list containing all the duplicate elements in lft that must have at least 1 element, rdb is a list containing all the duplicate elements in rgt, sng is a list containing all the single elements in lft, and elem is the first element in ldb**
