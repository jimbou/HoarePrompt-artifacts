The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `n`, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is less than `n` and `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive.
State: **`T` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is less than `n`, if `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` is a list containing the value of `lft[i]`, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, `elem` is undefined, `sz` is equal to `k`. If `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, if `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` is a list containing `lft[i]`. Otherwise, `sng` is an empty list, `elem` is undefined, `sz` is equal to `k`.**
