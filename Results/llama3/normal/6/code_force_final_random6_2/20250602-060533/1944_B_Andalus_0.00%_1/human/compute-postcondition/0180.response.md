Output State: **T is greater than 1, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, i is equal to n, sz is equal to 4 if k - sz >= 0, otherwise sz remains the same, ldb is a list containing all the duplicate elements in lft that must have at least 3 elements, rdb is a list containing all the duplicate elements in rgt, sng is a list containing all the single elements in lft, and elem is the third element in ldb, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, but does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, all the variables retain their original values and properties. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2. The lists lst, lft, rgt, ldb, rdb, and sng also retain their original properties. The variable elem is still the third element in ldb.
