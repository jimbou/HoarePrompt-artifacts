Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1 and between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive. `i` is 2, `ldb` is a list containing the current value of `lft[2]`, `rdb` is an empty list, and `sng` is an empty list if `lft[2]` is equal to `lft[1]`, otherwise `ldb` is a list containing the current value of `lft[2]`, `rdb` is an empty list, and `sng` is a list containing one integer which is equal to `lft[2]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `T` is still greater than 0, and the value of `_` is still 0. The number of test cases in `stdin` is still multiple test cases minus 1. The value of `n` is still an integer greater than 1 and between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, and the value of `k` is still an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive. The list `lst` still contains 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, and the lists `lft` and `rgt` still contain sorted lists of n integers between 1 and n inclusive. The value of `i` is still 2. The list `ldb` now contains the current value of `lft[2]`, and the lists `rdb` and `sng` are still empty if `lft[2]` is equal to `lft[1]`. Otherwise, the list `ldb` now contains the current value of `lft[2]`, the list `rdb` is still empty, and the list `sng` now contains one integer which is equal to `lft[2]`.
