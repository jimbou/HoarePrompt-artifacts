Output State: **`T` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least one value that is not equal to the previous value and the next value, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is equal to n, `ldb` is a list containing all the values of `lft` that are equal to the previous value, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` must have at least 2 elements, and the second element in `sng` which is `elem` is printed, `sz` is increased by 1, and if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the second element of `sng` which is `elem` is printed**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the variable `sz` has been incremented by 1. This means that `sz` now has a value one greater than its initial value. Additionally, if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program will break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the second element of `sng`, which is `elem`, will be printed.
