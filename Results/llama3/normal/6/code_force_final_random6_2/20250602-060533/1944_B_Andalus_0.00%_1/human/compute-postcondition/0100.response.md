To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for elem in rdb:`. The only object in the loop head is `elem` and the list `rdb`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `rdb`. If the list `rdb` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `elem` is the second element in `rdb`, and `rdb` has at least two elements.

For the loop to execute one more time, `rdb` must have at least three elements, and `elem` must be the third element in `rdb`.

State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive and has at least two duplicate elements, `ldb` is a list containing all the values of `lft[i]` where `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, `rdb` is a list containing all the values of `rgt[i]` where `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]` and has at least three elements, `sng` is a list containing all the values of `lft[i]` where `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, `elem` is the third element in `rdb`, `i` is equal to `n`.**
