Output State: **`T` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is equal to `n`, `sz` is equal to `k - 2`, `ldb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements in `lft`, `rdb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements in `rgt` that must have at least 1 element, `sng` is an empty list, `elem` is the first element in the list `rdb`, and the first element of the list `rdb` which is `elem` is printed twice with a space in between.**

The value of `sz` is incremented by 2, but the previous value of `sz` was at least `k`, so the new value of `sz` is at least `k + 2`. However, since `k - sz` was greater than or equal to 2, the new value of `sz` is at most `k - 2`. Therefore, the new value of `sz` is exactly `k - 2`. The values of the other variables are not affected.
