Postcondition: ***The program either breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement when the size `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, or it continues execution when `sz` is less than `k`. If the difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to 2, the program prints "elem elem" (where elem is the second element in the list `ldb`) and increments `sz` by 2. Otherwise, no printing or incrementing occurs.***
