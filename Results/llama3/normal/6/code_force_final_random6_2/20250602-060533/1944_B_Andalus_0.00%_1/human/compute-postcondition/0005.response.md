Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1 and between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing the current value of `lft[i]`, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, and `i` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `lft[i]` is appended to the list `ldb`. Since `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, the list `ldb` now contains a duplicate value. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
