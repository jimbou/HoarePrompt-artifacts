To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `elem` and `ldb`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `ldb` list. If `ldb` has at least two elements, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `ldb` has at least one element, and `elem` is the first element in `ldb`. For the loop to execute again, `ldb` must have at least two elements, and `elem` must be the second element in `ldb`.

State: **`T` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least two values equal to the previous value, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is equal to n, `ldb` is a list containing all the values of `lft` that are equal to the previous value and must have at least two elements, `rdb` is a list containing all the values of `rgt` that are equal to the previous value, `sng` is a list containing all the values of `lft` that are not equal to the previous value and the next value, `elem` is the second element in `ldb`, and if `(k - sz)` is greater than or equal to 2, the first element in `ldb` which is equal to the first element in `ldb` is printed twice.**
