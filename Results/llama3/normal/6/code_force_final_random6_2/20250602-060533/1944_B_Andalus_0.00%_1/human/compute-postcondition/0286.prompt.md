Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is greater than 2, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, i is equal to n, ldb is a list containing all the values of lft that are equal to the previous value, rdb is an empty list, sng is a list containing all the values of lft that are not equal to the previous value and the next value, elem is undefined, sz is equal to k.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if rgt[i] == rgt[i - 1]:
        rdb.append(rgt[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`T` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is 1, `ldb` is a list containing all the values of `lft` that are equal to the previous value, `sng` is a list containing all the values of `lft` that are not equal to the previous value and the next value, `elem` is undefined, `sz` is equal to `k`. If the current value of `rgt[i]` is equal to the current value of `rgt[i - 1]`, then `rdb` is a list containing the current value of `rgt[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *T is greater than 2, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 5 * 10^4 inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, i is 2, ldb is a list containing all the values of lft that are equal to the previous value, sng is a list containing all the values of lft that are not equal to the previous value and the next value, elem is undefined, sz is equal to k. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rdb is a list containing the current value of rgt[i] and the previous value of rgt[i].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *T is greater than 2, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer greater than 3 and less than or equal to 5 * 10^4 inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, i is 3, ldb is a list containing all the values of lft that are equal to the previous value, sng is a list containing all the values of lft that are not equal to the previous value and the next value, elem is undefined, sz is equal to k. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rdb is a list containing the current value of rgt[i] and the previous value of rgt[i].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
