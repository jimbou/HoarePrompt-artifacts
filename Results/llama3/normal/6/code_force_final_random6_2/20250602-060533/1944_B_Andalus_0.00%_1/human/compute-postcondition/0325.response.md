Output State: **T is greater than 2, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least one value that is not equal to the previous value and the next value, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, i is equal to n, ldb is a list containing all the values of lft that are equal to the previous value, rdb is a list containing all the values of rgt that are equal to the previous value, sng is a list containing all the values of lft that are not equal to the previous value and the next value that must have at least 2 values, elem is the second element in sng, and sz is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of sz has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The program still has multiple test cases to process, and the values of n, lst, lft, rgt, i, ldb, rdb, sng, and elem are still valid. The program will continue to execute until sz is greater than or equal to k, at which point it will break out of the most internal loop or if statement and print the second element of sng, which is elem.
