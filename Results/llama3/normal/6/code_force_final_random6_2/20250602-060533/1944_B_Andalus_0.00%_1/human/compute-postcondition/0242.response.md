Output State: **`T` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is equal to `n`, `ldb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements in `lft`, `rdb` is a list containing all the duplicate elements in `rgt` that must have at least `floor(k/2)` elements, `sng` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `elem` is the second element in the list `sng`, `sz` is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables do not change, but the program execution is interrupted, and we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
