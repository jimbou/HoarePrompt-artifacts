Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is greater than 0, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing all the values of lft[i] where lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], rdb is a list containing all the values of rgt[i] where rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], sng is a list containing all the values of lft[i] where i is less than n - 1 and lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], i is equal to n, and sz is 0.
Code of the loop:
for elem in ldb:
    if sz >= k:
        break
    if k - sz >= 2:
        print(elem, elem, end=' ')
        sz += 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: T is greater than 0, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing all the values of lft[i] where lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1] and must have at least 1 element, rdb is a list containing all the values of rgt[i] where rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], sng is a list containing all the values of lft[i] where i is less than n - 1 and lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], i is equal to n, and the current value of sz is either greater than or equal to k, in which case we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or sz is less than k. Additionally, if the difference between k and sz is greater than or equal to 2, then "elem elem" is printed (where elem is an element of the list) and sz is increased by 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *The program either breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement when the size `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, or it continues execution when `sz` is less than `k`. If the difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to 2, the program prints "elem elem" (where elem is the second element in the list `ldb`) and increments `sz` by 2. Otherwise, no printing or incrementing occurs.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`ldb` has at least one more element, `elem` is the next element in the list `ldb`. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, `sz` is increased by 2 and the next element in the list `ldb` which is `elem` is printed twice, separated by a space. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
