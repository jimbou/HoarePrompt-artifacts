Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is greater than 0, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is an empty list, rdb is an empty list, sng is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if lft[i] == lft[i - 1]:
        ldb.append(lft[i])
    elif i < n - 1 and lft[i] != lft[i + 1]:
        sng.append(lft[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1 and between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` is a list containing the current value of `lft[i]`, `rdb` is an empty list, and `sng` is an empty list. Otherwise, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, and if `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` is a list containing one integer which is equal to `lft[i]`. Otherwise, `sng` is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *T is greater than 0, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer greater than 1 and between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive. If lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], then ldb is a list containing the current value of lft[i], rdb is an empty list, and sng is an empty list. Otherwise, ldb is an empty list, rdb is an empty list, and if i is less than n - 1 and lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], then sng is a list containing one integer which is equal to lft[i]. Otherwise, sng is an empty list. If lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], then i is 2. Otherwise, if i is less than n - 1 and lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], then i is 3. Otherwise, i is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer greater than 3 and between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` is a list containing the current value of `lft[i]`, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, and `i` is 3. Otherwise, if `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing one integer which is equal to `lft[i]`, and `i` is 4. Otherwise, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, and `i` is 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
