Based on the precondition, the print statement will output the calculated cost.

The cost is calculated based on the values of `m`, `n`, `N`, `w`, and `mu`. If `n * m` equals `k`, then `n` is `q`, and `N` is the first `q` elements of the sorted list `M`. In this case, the cost is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.

If `n * m` does not equal `k`, then `n` is the length of `N` after popping one element, `N` is the first `q` elements of the sorted list `M` after popping one element, `w` is the popped element from `N`, and `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`. In this case, the cost is calculated based on `mu`, `w`, `N`, `n`, `m`, and `mu`.

Since the exact values of `m`, `k`, `M`, and `L` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `cost`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated cost.

Output: **cost (where cost is the calculated cost based on the values of m, n, N, w, and mu)**
