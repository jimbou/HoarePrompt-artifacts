Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains three integers n, m, and k (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, 1 <= m <= 10^9, 1 <= k <= min(n*m, 10^9)). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    L = list(map(int, input().split()))
    M = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n, m, k = L[0], L[1], L[2]
    m = min(m, k)
    M.sort()
    q = int(math.ceil(k / m))
    N = M[:q]
    n = len(N)
    if n * m == k:
        cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)
    else:
        w = N.pop()
        mu = k - (n - 1) * m
        cost = mu * w
        n = len(N)
        cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu
    print(cost)
    continue


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is at least 1, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is q, m is the minimum of the original m and k, M is sorted, N is the first q elements of the sorted M, q is the ceiling of k divided by m. If the product of the current value of n and the current value of m equals k, then cost is m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2). Otherwise, n is the length of N, m is the minimum of the original m and k, M is sorted, N is the first q-1 elements of the sorted M, q is the ceiling of k divided by m, and n * m is not equal to k, w is the last element of the original N, mu is k - (q - 1) * m, cost is mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((q - 2) * (q - 1) // 2) + (q - 1) * m * mu, and cost is printed, and we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is at least 2, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, n is q, m is the minimum of the original m and k, M is sorted, N is the first q elements of the sorted M, q is the ceiling of k divided by m, L is a list of three integers, and M is a list of integers. If n * m equals k, then cost is m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2). Otherwise, n is the length of N, w is the last element removed from N, mu is k - (q - 1) * m, and cost is mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((q - 2) * (q - 1) // 2) + (q - 1) * m * mu, and the cost is printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is at least 2, `_` is 2, `m` is the minimum of the original `m` and `k`, `M` is sorted, `q` is the ceiling of `k` divided by `m`, `L` is a list of three integers, and `M` is a list of integers. If `n * m` equals `k`, then `n` is `q`, `N` is the first `q` elements of the sorted `M`, and `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Otherwise, `n` is the length of `N` after popping one element, `N` is the first `q` elements of the sorted `M` after popping one element, `w` is the popped element from `N`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `cost` is the calculated cost based on `mu`, `w`, `N`, `n`, `m`, and `mu`, and the cost is printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
