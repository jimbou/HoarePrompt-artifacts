Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases, t, and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of sale days, n, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, m, and the number of tickets to be bought, k.
3. It then reads the prices per ticket for each of the upcoming n days and stores them in the list M.
4. The program sorts the prices in ascending order and selects the first q prices, where q is the ceiling of k divided by m. This is because the program wants to buy the cheapest tickets first.
5. If the product of the number of selected prices (n) and m equals k, the program calculates the cost as m times the sum of the selected prices plus m squared times the sum of the first n-1 positive integers. This is because the program can buy all the tickets at the selected prices without increasing the prices.
6. Otherwise, the program calculates the cost as the product of the last selected price and the difference between k and the product of the number of selected prices minus one and m, plus m times the sum of the selected prices minus the last one, plus m squared times the sum of the first n-2 positive integers, plus the product of the number of selected prices minus one, m, and the difference between k and the product of the number of selected prices minus one and m. This is because the program needs to buy the remaining tickets at the last selected price, which will increase the prices for the remaining days.
7. Finally, the program prints the calculated cost.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets, taking into account the constraints of the problem.
