The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `t` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is q, m is the minimum of the original m and k, M is sorted, N is the first q elements of the sorted M, q is the ceiling of k divided by m. If the product of the current value of n and the current value of m equals k, then cost is m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2). Otherwise, n is the length of N, m is the minimum of the original m and k, M is sorted, N is the first q-1 elements of the sorted M, q is the ceiling of k divided by m, and n * m is not equal to k, w is the last element of the original N, mu is k - (q - 1) * m, cost is mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((q - 2) * (q - 1) // 2) + (q - 1) * m * mu, and cost is printed, and we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop.**
