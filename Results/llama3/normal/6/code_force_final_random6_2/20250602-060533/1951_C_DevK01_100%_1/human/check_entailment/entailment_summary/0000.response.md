Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets. The program first sorts the prices of the tickets in ascending order. Then, it calculates the cost by considering the minimum number of days required to purchase k tickets. If the product of the number of days and the maximum number of tickets that can be purchased per day (m) equals k, the program calculates the cost by multiplying the sum of the prices of the tickets by m and adding the sum of the first n-1 positive integers multiplied by m squared. Otherwise, the program calculates the cost by multiplying the last selected price by the difference between k and the product of the number of days minus one and m, adding the sum of the prices of the tickets minus the last one multiplied by m, adding the sum of the first n-2 positive integers multiplied by m squared, and adding the product of the number of days minus one, m, and the difference between k and the product of the number of days minus one and m.

The program correctly handles the case where the product of the number of days and m equals k, and the case where it does not. It also correctly calculates the cost in both cases.

Correctness: **True**
