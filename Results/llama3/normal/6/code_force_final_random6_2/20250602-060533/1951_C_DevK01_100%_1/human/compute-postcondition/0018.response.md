Output State: **t is at least 2, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, n is q, m is the minimum of the original m and k, M is sorted, N is the first q elements of the sorted M, q is the ceiling of k divided by m, L is a list of three integers, and M is a list of integers. If n * m equals k, then cost is m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2). Otherwise, n is the length of N, w is the last element removed from N, mu is k - (q - 1) * m, and cost is mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((q - 2) * (q - 1) // 2) + (q - 1) * m * mu, and the cost is printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. All variables retain their original values and properties, and the cost is still printed. The only change is that we move on to the next iteration of the loop, without executing any further code in the current iteration.
