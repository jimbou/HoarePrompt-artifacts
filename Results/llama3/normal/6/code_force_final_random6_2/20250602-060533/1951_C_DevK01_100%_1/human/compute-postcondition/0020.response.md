Output State: **t is at least 2, _ is 2, n is q, m is the minimum of the original m and k, M is sorted, N is the first q elements of the sorted M, q is the ceiling of k divided by m, L is a list of three integers, and M is a list of integers.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of t remains at least 2, and the value of _ remains 2. The value of n is now equal to q, which is the ceiling of k divided by m. The value of m is now the minimum of the original m and k. The list M is sorted in ascending order. The list N consists of the first q elements of the sorted M. The value of q is the ceiling of k divided by m. The list L contains three integers, and the list M contains a list of integers.
