Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 2, `m` is the minimum of the original `m` and `k`, `M` is sorted, `q` is the ceiling of `k` divided by `m`, `L` is a list of three integers, and `M` is a list of integers. If `n * m` equals `k`, then `n` is `q`, `N` is the first `q` elements of the sorted `M`, and `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Otherwise, `n` is the length of `N` after popping one element, `N` is the first `q` elements of the sorted `M` after popping one element, `w` is the popped element from `N`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `cost` is the calculated cost based on `mu`, `w`, `N`, `n`, `m`, and `mu`, and the cost is printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. The values of the variables remain unchanged, and the conditions and relationships between them are still valid.
