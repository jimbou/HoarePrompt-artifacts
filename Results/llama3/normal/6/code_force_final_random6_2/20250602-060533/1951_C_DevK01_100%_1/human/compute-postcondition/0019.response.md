To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `_` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 1, and `t` is at least 2. To execute the loop again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **t is at least 2, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, n is q, m is the minimum of the original m and k, M is sorted, N is the first q elements of the sorted M, q is the ceiling of k divided by m, L is a list of three integers, and M is a list of integers. If n * m equals k, then cost is m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2). Otherwise, n is the length of N, w is the last element removed from N, mu is k - (q - 1) * m, and cost is mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((q - 2) * (q - 1) // 2) + (q - 1) * m * mu, and the cost is printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
