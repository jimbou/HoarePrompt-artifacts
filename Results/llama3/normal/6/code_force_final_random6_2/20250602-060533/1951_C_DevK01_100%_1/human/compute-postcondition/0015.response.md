Postcondition: ***t is at least 2, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, n is q, m is the minimum of the original m and k, M is sorted, N is the first q elements of the sorted M, q is the ceiling of k divided by m, L is a list of three integers, and M is a list of integers. If n * m equals k, then cost is m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2). Otherwise, n is the length of N, w is the last element removed from N, mu is k - (q - 1) * m, and cost is mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((q - 2) * (q - 1) // 2) + (q - 1) * m * mu.***
