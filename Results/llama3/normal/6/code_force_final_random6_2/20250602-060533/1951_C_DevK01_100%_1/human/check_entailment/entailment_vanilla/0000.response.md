Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum spending to purchase k tickets, given the prices per ticket for each of the upcoming n days, and the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day (m).

The provided program attempts to solve this problem by sorting the prices per ticket in ascending order, and then calculating the minimum spending by purchasing tickets on the days with the lowest prices.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. Read the input: The program reads the number of test cases (t), and then for each test case, it reads the number of sale days (n), the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day (m), and the number of tickets to be bought (k).

2. Sort the prices: The program sorts the prices per ticket in ascending order.

3. Calculate the minimum spending: The program calculates the minimum spending by purchasing tickets on the days with the lowest prices. It does this by iterating over the sorted prices and calculating the cost of purchasing tickets on each day.

4. Handle the case where the number of tickets to be bought is not a multiple of m: If the number of tickets to be bought (k) is not a multiple of m, the program calculates the cost of purchasing the remaining tickets on the last day.

5. Print the result: The program prints the minimum spending required to purchase k tickets.

However, there are a few issues with the program's logic:

* The program assumes that the prices per ticket will always increase by the number of tickets purchased on each day. However, this is not necessarily true, as the problem statement only guarantees that the prices will increase by the number of tickets purchased, but does not specify how the prices will change.

* The program does not take into account the fact that the prices per ticket may change over time. It simply sorts the prices and assumes that the lowest prices will always be available.

* The program does not handle the case where the number of tickets to be bought is greater than the number of days. In this case, the program will attempt to purchase tickets on days that do not exist, which will result in incorrect results.

* The program does not handle the case where the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day (m) is greater than the number of tickets to be bought (k). In this case, the program will attempt to purchase more tickets than are available, which will result in incorrect results.

Overall, the program's logic is flawed, and it does not correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
