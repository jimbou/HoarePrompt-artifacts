Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 2, `n` is `q`, `m` is the minimum of the original `m` and `k`, `M` is sorted, `N` is the first `q` elements of the sorted `M`, `q` is the ceiling of `k` divided by `m`, `L` is a list of three integers, `M` is a list of integers, and `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` is still at least 2, `_` remains 2, `n` is still equal to `q`, `m` is still the minimum of the original `m` and `k`, `M` is still sorted, `N` is still the first `q` elements of the sorted `M`, `q` is still the ceiling of `k` divided by `m`, `L` is still a list of three integers, and `M` is still a list of integers. Additionally, a new variable `cost` has been introduced, which is calculated as the sum of `m` times the sum of the elements in `N`, and `m` times `m` times the sum of the first `n-1` positive integers.
