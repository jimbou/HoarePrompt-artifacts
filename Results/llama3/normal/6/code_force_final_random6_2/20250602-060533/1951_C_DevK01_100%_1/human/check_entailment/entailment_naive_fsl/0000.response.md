Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when the number of tickets to be bought (k) is not a multiple of the maximum number of tickets that can be bought per day (m). In this case, the program incorrectly calculates the cost of buying the remaining tickets.

For example, if n = 4, m = 2, k = 3, and the prices are [8, 6, 4, 2], the program will incorrectly calculate the cost as 10, whereas the correct cost is 4 + 6 = 10.

The program assumes that the number of tickets to be bought is always a multiple of the maximum number of tickets that can be bought per day, which is not always the case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Here is a counterexample:

Input:

4 2 3
8 6 4 2

Output:

10 ( incorrect )

Correct Output:

10
