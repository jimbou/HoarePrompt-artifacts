Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`, `n` is `q`, `m` is the minimum of the original `m` and `k`, `M` is sorted, `N` is the first `q` elements of the sorted `M`, `q` is the ceiling of `k` divided by `m`, `L` is a list of three integers, and `M` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In this output state, the value of `cost` is calculated based on the values of `m`, `N`, and `n`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `cost` is a combination of the sum of the first `q` elements of the sorted list `M` multiplied by `m`, and the product of `m` squared and the sum of the first `n-1` positive integers multiplied by `n` divided by 2.
