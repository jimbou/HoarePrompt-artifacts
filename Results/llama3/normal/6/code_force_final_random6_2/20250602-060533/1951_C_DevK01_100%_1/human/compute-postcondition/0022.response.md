Output State: **t is at least 2, _ is 2, n is the length of N after popping one element, m is the minimum of the original m and k, M is sorted, N is the first q elements of the sorted M after popping one element, q is the ceiling of k divided by m, L is a list of three integers, M is a list of integers, w is the popped element from N, mu is k - (n - 1) * m, cost is the calculated cost based on mu, w, N, n, m, and mu.**

Here's a breakdown of the changes:

* The first line pops an element from N and assigns it to w. This reduces the length of N by 1.
* The second line calculates mu as k - (n - 1) * m. This value is used in the subsequent calculations.
* The third line calculates the initial cost as mu * w.
* The fourth line updates n to be the length of N after the pop operation.
* The fifth line updates the cost by adding m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu. This calculation takes into account the updated values of n and mu.

Note that the values of t, _, L, and M remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The values of m and q also remain unchanged, as they are not updated by the code.
