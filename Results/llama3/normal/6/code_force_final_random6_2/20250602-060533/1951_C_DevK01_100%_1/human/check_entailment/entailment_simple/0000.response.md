Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input and initializes the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`.
2.  It sorts the prices `M` in ascending order, which is necessary to find the minimum spending.
3.  It calculates the number of days `q` needed to buy `k` tickets, considering the maximum number of tickets that can be bought per day `m`.
4.  It handles two cases:

    *   If the product of the number of days `n` and the maximum number of tickets per day `m` equals `k`, it calculates the cost as `m` times the sum of the prices for the first `n` days, plus the additional cost due to the price increase.
    *   If the product of `n` and `m` does not equal `k`, it calculates the cost by buying `mu` tickets on the last day, where `mu` is the remaining number of tickets to buy, and then buying `m` tickets on the previous days.
5.  The program correctly calculates the additional cost due to the price increase, which is `m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` in the first case and `n * m * mu` in the second case.
6.  Finally, the program prints the calculated cost.

Correctness: **True**
