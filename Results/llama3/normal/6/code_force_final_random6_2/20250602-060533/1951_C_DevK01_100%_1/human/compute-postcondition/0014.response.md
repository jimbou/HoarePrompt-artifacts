Output State: **t is at least 2, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, n is the length of N, m is the minimum of the original m and k, M is sorted, N is the first q-1 elements of the sorted M, q is the ceiling of k divided by m, L is a list of three integers, M is a list of integers, w is the last element removed from N, mu is k - (q - 1) * m, cost is mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((q - 2) * (q - 1) // 2) + (q - 1) * m * mu.**

In this final state, the value of `n` has been updated to the length of `N`, which is now one less than its original length due to the removal of the last element `w`. The value of `mu` has been calculated as `k - (q - 1) * m`, and the value of `cost` has been calculated as the sum of `mu * w`, `m * sum(N)`, `m * m * ((q - 2) * (q - 1) // 2)`, and `(q - 1) * m * mu`. All other variables remain unchanged.
