Output: **t is at least 2, _ is 2, m is the minimum of the original m and k, M is sorted, q is the ceiling of k divided by m, L is a list of three integers, and M is a list of integers. If n * m equals k, then n is q, N is the first q elements of the sorted M, and cost is m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2). Otherwise, n is the length of N after popping one element, N is the first q elements of the sorted M after popping one element, w is the popped element from N, mu is k - (n - 1) * m, and cost is the calculated cost based on mu, w, N, n, m, and mu, and the cost is printed**
