Postcondition: ***t is at least 1, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is q, m is the minimum of the original m and k, M is sorted, N is the first q elements of the sorted M, q is the ceiling of k divided by m. If the product of the current value of n and the current value of m equals k, then cost is m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2). Otherwise, n is the length of N, m is the minimum of the original m and k, M is sorted, N is the first q-1 elements of the sorted M, q is the ceiling of k divided by m, and n * m is not equal to k, w is the last element of the original N, mu is k - (q - 1) * m, cost is mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((q - 2) * (q - 1) // 2) + (q - 1) * m * mu***
