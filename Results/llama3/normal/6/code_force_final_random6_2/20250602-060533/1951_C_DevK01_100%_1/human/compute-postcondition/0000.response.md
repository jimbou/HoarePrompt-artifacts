Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains three integers n, m, and k (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, 1 <= m <= 10^9, 1 <= k <= min(n*m, 10^9)). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).**

The value of `t` is assigned the number of test cases, which is a positive integer. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each with two lines. The first line contains three integers n, m, and k, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. The values of n, m, k, and a_i are still within their respective ranges.
