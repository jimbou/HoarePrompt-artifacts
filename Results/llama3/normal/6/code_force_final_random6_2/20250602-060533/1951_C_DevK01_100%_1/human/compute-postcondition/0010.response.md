Output State: **t is at least 1, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is q, m is the minimum of the original m and k, M is sorted, N is the first q elements of the sorted M, q is the ceiling of k divided by m. If the product of the current value of n and the current value of m equals k, then cost is m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2). Otherwise, n is the length of N, m is the minimum of the original m and k, M is sorted, N is the first q-1 elements of the sorted M, q is the ceiling of k divided by m, and n * m is not equal to k, w is the last element of the original N, mu is k - (q - 1) * m, cost is mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((q - 2) * (q - 1) // 2) + (q - 1) * m * mu, and cost is printed, and we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop due to the "continue" statement. The values of the variables remain unchanged, and the program moves on to the next iteration of the loop.
