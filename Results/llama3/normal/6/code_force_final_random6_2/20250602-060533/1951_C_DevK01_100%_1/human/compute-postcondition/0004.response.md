Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, the current value of `n` is `q`, the current value of `m` is the minimum of the original `m` and `k`, `M` is sorted, `N` is the first `q` elements of the sorted `M`, `q` is the ceiling of `k` divided by `m`, the product of the current value of `n` and the current value of `m` equals `k`, `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`**.

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still at least 1, and the value of `_` is still 0. The number of test cases in stdin has decreased by one. The current values of `n` and `m` remain the same, with `n` being equal to `q` and `m` being the minimum of the original `m` and `k`. The list `M` is still sorted, and `N` is still the first `q` elements of the sorted `M`. The value of `q` is still the ceiling of `k` divided by `m`, and the product of the current values of `n` and `m` still equals `k`. A new variable `cost` has been introduced, which is calculated as the sum of the products of `m` and the sum of the elements in `N`, and `m` squared times the sum of the first `n-1` positive integers.
