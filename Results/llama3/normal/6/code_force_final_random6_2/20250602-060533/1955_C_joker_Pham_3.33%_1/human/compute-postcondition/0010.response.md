Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers. If `l` is equal to `r`, then if `k` is greater than or equal to the last element of `a`, `l` is `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 1`, and `sunks` is 1. Otherwise, no change occurs. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l` is not equal to `r`, no change occurs.***
