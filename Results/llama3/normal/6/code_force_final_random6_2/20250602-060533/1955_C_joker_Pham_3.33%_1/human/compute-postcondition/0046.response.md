Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` is `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 1`, `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, and `sunks` is a positive integer. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
