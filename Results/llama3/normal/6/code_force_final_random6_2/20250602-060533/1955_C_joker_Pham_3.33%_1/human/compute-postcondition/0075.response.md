Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` is less than `n - 1`, `r` is greater than `n - 1`, `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement and `sunks` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
