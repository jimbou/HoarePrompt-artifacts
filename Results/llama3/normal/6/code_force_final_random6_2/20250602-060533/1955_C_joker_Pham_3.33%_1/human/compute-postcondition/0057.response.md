Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` is `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 1`, `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`. If `a[l] * 2 - 1` equals `k`, then `sunks` is a positive integer equal to its original value plus 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
