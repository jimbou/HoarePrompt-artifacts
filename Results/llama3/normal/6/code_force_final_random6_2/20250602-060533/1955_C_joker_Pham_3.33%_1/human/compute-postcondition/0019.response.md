Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers. If `l` is equal to `r`, then if `k` is greater than or equal to the last element of `a`, the current value of `l` is `n - 1`, the current value of `r` is `n - 1`, and the current value of `sunks` is 1. Otherwise, no change occurs. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l` is not equal to `r`, no change occurs. Additionally, the current value of `a[l]` is less than or equal to the current value of `a[r]`. The value of `k` is less than `a[l] * 2`. The current value of `k` is equal to `a[l] * 2 - 1`.**
