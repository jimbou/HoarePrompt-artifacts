Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, the current value of `l` is equal to `r`, which is `n - 1`, and the current value of `sunks` is 0. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.**
