Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers. If `a[l] * 2 - 1` equals `k`, then `l` is `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 1`, and `sunks` is 2. If `l` is equal to `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to the last element of `a`, then `l` is `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 1`, and `sunks` is 1. Otherwise, no change occurs. Additionally, the current value of `a[l]` is less than or equal to the current value of `a[r]`. The value of `k` is less than `a[l] * 2`.***
