Postcondition: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers. If a[l] is 0, then if a[l] is less than or equal to a[r], if k is greater than or equal to a[l] * 2, l is equal to r + 1 and sunks is 4. If a[r] is 0, then l is n - 1, r is n - 2, and a[l] is less than or equal to a[r]. If a[l] * 2 - 1 equals k, then l is n - 1, r is n - 1, and sunks is 3. If l is equal to r and k is greater than or equal to the last element of a, then l is n - 1, r is n - 1, and sunks is 2. If k is 0, then l is n - 1, r is n - 2, a[l] is less than or equal to a[r], and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs. Additionally, the current value of k is greater than or equal to the current value of a[r] multiplied by 2. k is now equal to its original value minus a[r] * 2. a[l] is now equal to its original value minus a[r]. l is now equal to its original value plus 1. If a[l] is not 0, then the current value of k is greater than or equal to the current value of a[r] multiplied by 2. k is now equal to its original value minus a[r] * 2. a[l] is now equal to its original value minus a[r].**
