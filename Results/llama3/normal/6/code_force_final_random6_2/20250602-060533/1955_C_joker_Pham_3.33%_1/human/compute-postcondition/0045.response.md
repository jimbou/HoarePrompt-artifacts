Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` is `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 1`, `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, `sunks` is a positive integer, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all the variables maintain their initial values and properties, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
