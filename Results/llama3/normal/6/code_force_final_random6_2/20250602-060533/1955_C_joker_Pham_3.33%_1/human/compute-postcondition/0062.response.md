Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer decreased by 2 * a[r], a is a list of n positive integers where a[l] is decreased by a[r], l is n - 1, r is n - 1, a[l] is less than or equal to a[r]. If k is 0, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if k is greater than or equal to a[l] * 2, then k is decreased by 2 * a[l], l is set to n, and sunks is increased by 1. If k is less than a[l] * 2 and a[l] * 2 - 1 equals k, then sunks is increased by 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
