Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` is less than `n - 1`, `r` is greater than `n - 1`, `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`. If `l` is equal to `r`, then `sunks` is incremented by 1 if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
