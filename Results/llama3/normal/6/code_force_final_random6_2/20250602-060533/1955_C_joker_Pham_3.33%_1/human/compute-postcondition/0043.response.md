Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers. If `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, then if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r] * 2`, `l` is equal to its original value plus 1, `r` is equal to its original value minus 1, and `sunks` is equal to its original value plus 1. Otherwise, if `a[r] * 2 - 1` equals `k`, then `l` is `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 1`, and `sunks` is 3. If neither condition is met, then `l` is `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 2`, `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. In all cases, `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, and `k` is less than `a[r] * 2`. If `a[r]` is not less than `a[l]`, then the original conditions apply: if `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, then if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l] * 2`, `l` is equal to `r + 1` and `sunks` is 3. If `a[r]` is 0, then `l` is `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 2`, and `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`. Otherwise, if `a[l] * 2 - 1` equals `k`, then `l` is `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 1`, and `sunks` is 2. If `l` is equal to `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to the last element of `a`, then `l` is `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 1`, and `sunks` is 1. If `k` is 0, then `l` is `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 2`, `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs. Additionally, the current value of `a[l]` is less than or equal to the current value of `a[r]`.***
