Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, l is 0, r is n - 1, sunks is 0
Code of the loop:
while l <= r:
    if k == 0:
        break
    if l == r:
        if k >= a[r]:
            sunks += 1
            break
        break
    if a[l] <= a[r]:
        if k >= a[l] * 2:
            k -= a[l] * 2
            a[r] -= a[l]
            if a[r] == 0:
                sunks += 1
                r -= 1
            sunks += 1
            l += 1
            continue
        elif a[l] * 2 - 1 == k:
            sunks += 1
            break
        else:
            break
    if k == 0:
        break
    if a[r] < a[l]:
        if k >= a[r] * 2:
            k -= a[r] * 2
            a[l] -= a[r]
            if a[l] == 0:
                sunks += 1
                l += 1
            sunks += 1
            r -= 1
            continue
        elif a[r] * 2 - 1 == k:
            sunks += 1
            break
        else:
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers. If `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, then if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r] * 2`, `l` is equal to its original value plus 1, `r` is equal to its original value minus 1, and `sunks` is equal to its original value plus 1. Otherwise, if `a[r] * 2 - 1` equals `k`, then `l` is `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 1`, and `sunks` is 3. If neither condition is met, then `l` is `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 2`, `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. In all cases, `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, and `k` is less than `a[r] * 2`. If `a[r]` is not less than `a[l]`, then the original conditions apply: if `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, then if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l] * 2`, `l` is equal to `r + 1` and `sunks` is 3. If `a[r]` is 0, then `l` is `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 2`, and `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`. Otherwise, if `a[l] * 2 - 1` equals `k`, then `l` is `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 1`, and `sunks` is 2. If `l` is equal to `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to the last element of `a`, then `l` is `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 1`, and `sunks` is 1. If `k` is 0, then `l` is `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 2`, `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs. Additionally, the current value of `a[l]` is less than or equal to the current value of `a[r]`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` is `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 1`, `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`. If `k` is 0, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l] * 2`, then `k` is decreased by `2 * a[l]`, `l` is set to `n`, and `sunks` is increased by 1. If `k` is less than `a[l] * 2` and `a[l] * 2 - 1` equals `k`, then `sunks` is increased by 1. If `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, then if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r] * 2`, then `k` is decreased by `2 * a[r]`, `l` is set to `n - 2`, `r` is set to `n - 2`, `a[l]` is decreased by `a[r]`, and `sunks` is increased by 1. If `k` is less than `a[r] * 2` and `a[r] * 2 - 1` equals `k`, then `sunks` is increased by 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` is less than `n - 1`, `r` is greater than `n - 1`. If `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, then if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r] * 2`, `k` is decreased by `a[r] * 2`, `a[l]` is decreased by `a[r]`, `l` is incremented by 1, and `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `a[r] * 2 - 1` equals `k`, then `sunks` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[r]` is not less than `a[l]`, then if `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, then if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l] * 2`, `sunks` is incremented by 1 and `l` is incremented by 1. If `k` is less than `a[l] * 2`, then if `a[l] * 2 - 1` equals `k`, `sunks` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `l` is equal to `r`, then `sunks` is incremented by 1 if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
