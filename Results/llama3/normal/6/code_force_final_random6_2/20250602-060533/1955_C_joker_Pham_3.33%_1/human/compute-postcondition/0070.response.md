Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` is `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 1`, `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`. If `k` is 0, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l] * 2`, then `k` is decreased by `2 * a[l]`, `l` is set to `n`, and `sunks` is increased by 1. If `k` is less than `a[l] * 2` and `a[l] * 2 - 1` equals `k`, then `sunks` is increased by 1. If `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, then if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r] * 2`, then `k` is decreased by `2 * a[r]`, `l` is set to `n - 2`, `r` is set to `n - 2`, `a[l]` is decreased by `a[r]`, and `sunks` is increased by 1. If `k` is less than `a[r] * 2` and `a[r] * 2 - 1` equals `k`, then `sunks` is increased by 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
