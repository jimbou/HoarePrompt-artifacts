Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, l is equal to r. If a[r] is 0, then l is n - 2, r is n - 2, sunks is 2, a[l] is less than or equal to a[r], k is greater than or equal to twice the value of a[l], and the current value of a[r] is 0. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
