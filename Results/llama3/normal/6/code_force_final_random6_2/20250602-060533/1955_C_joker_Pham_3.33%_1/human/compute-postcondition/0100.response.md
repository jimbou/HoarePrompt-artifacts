Functionality: **This function takes a list of positive integers and two positive integers as input, and returns the maximum number of pairs of integers that can be removed from the list by repeatedly subtracting the smaller integer from the larger one, until the list is empty or no more pairs can be removed. The function modifies the input list in place, and the returned value represents the number of pairs removed.**
