Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer less than its original value by a[r] * 2, a is a list of n positive integers where a[l] is less than its original value by a[r], l is less than n - 1, r is greater than n - 1, a[l] is less than or equal to a[r]. If k is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if a[l] is less than or equal to a[r], then if k is greater than or equal to a[l] * 2, sunks is incremented by 1 and l is incremented by 1. If k is less than a[l] * 2, then if a[l] * 2 - 1 equals k, sunks is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if l is equal to r, then sunks is incremented by 1 if k is greater than or equal to a[r], and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs. If a[l] is 0, then sunks is incremented by 1.***
