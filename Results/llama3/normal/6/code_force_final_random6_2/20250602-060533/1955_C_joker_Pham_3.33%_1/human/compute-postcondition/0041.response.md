Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers. If `a[r] * 2 - 1` equals `k`, then `l` is `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 1`, and `sunks` is 3. Otherwise, `l` is `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 2`, `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. In both cases, `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, and `k` is less than `a[r] * 2`.***
