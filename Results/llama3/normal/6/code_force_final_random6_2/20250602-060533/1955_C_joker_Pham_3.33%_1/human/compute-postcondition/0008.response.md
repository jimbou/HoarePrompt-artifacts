Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers. If `k` is greater than or equal to the last element of `a`, then `l` is `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 1`, and `sunks` is 1. Otherwise, no change occurs. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
