Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers. If `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, then if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l] * 2`, `l` is equal to `r + 1` and `sunks` is 3. If `a[r]` is 0, then `l` is `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 2`, and `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`. Otherwise, if `a[l] * 2 - 1` equals `k`, then `l` is `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 1`, and `sunks` is 2. If `l` is equal to `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to the last element of `a`, then `l` is `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 1`, and `sunks` is 1. Otherwise, no change occurs. Additionally, the current value of `a[l]` is less than or equal to the current value of `a[r]`.***
