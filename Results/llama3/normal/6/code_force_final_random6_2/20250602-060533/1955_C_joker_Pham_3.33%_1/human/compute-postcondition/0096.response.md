Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` is less than `n - 1`, `r` is greater than `n - 1`, `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r] * 2`, then `k` is decreased by `a[r] * 2`, `a[l]` is decreased by `a[r]`, `l` is incremented by 1, and `sunks` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `a[r] * 2 - 1` equals `k`, then `sunks` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
