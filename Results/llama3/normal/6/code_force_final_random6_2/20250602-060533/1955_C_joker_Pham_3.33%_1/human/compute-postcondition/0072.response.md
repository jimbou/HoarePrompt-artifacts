Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` is less than `n - 1`, `r` is greater than `n - 1`, `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and the relationship between `a[l]` and `a[r]` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement that we were directly inside.
