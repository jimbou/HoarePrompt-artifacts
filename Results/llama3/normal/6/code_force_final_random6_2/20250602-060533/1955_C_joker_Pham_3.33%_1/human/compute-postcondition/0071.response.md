According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `r`. If `l` is less than or equal to `r`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 1`. So for the loop to be executed one more time `l` must be less than `n - 1` or `r` must be greater than `n - 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` is less than `n - 1`, `r` is greater than `n - 1`, `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`.**
