According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string s. If the string s is not empty the loop executes. Before the loop starts, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string of length m consisting of the first k lowercase English alphabets, us is a set of k lowercase English alphabets, win is an empty set, ans is an empty list, ps is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the string s must have at least 1 character and i is the first character in the string.
State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string of length m consisting of the first k lowercase English alphabets that must have at least 1 character, us is a set of k lowercase English alphabets, win is an empty set, ans is an empty list, ps is 0, i is the first character in the string**
