Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the string `s` contains characters that are not in the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. In this case, the program will not correctly identify all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

For example, if `n = 2`, `k = 2`, and `s = "abbaa"`, the program will incorrectly return "YES" because it only checks for the presence of the characters 'a' and 'b' in the string, but it does not check if all possible strings of length 2 can be formed using these characters.

To fix this issue, the program should be modified to ignore characters in the string that are not in the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
