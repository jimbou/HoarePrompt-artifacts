Postcondition: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is an empty string, us is a set of k lowercase English alphabets that must have at least 2 elements, win is an empty set, ans is a list containing all the characters in the string s that are in the set us and appear in the string s after every k-1 characters that are in the set us, ps is equal to the number of times k characters in the set us appear in the string s consecutively, and the number of times k characters in the set us appear in the string s consecutively is less than n. If i is not in the set win, a string is printed that starts with all the characters in the string s that are in the set us and appear in the string s after every k-1 characters that are in the set us, followed by the current value of i, and then 'a' repeated n - len(ans) - 1 times, where i is another element in the set us. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**
