Output State: **`stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string of length `m` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets that must have at least 3 characters, `us` is a set of `k` lowercase English alphabets, `win` is a set containing the third character `i` of the string `s`, `ans` is a list containing the first, second and third characters of the string `s`, `ps` is 3, and `i` is the third character in the string `s` and is also an element of the set `us`.**

In this output state, the code has added the third character `i` of the string `s` to the set `win`, which was previously empty. The other variables remain unchanged. The set `win` now contains the single element `i`, which is also the third character of the string `s` and an element of the set `us`.
