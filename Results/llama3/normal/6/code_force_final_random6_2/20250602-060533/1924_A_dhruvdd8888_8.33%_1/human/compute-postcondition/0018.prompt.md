Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string of length m consisting of the first k lowercase English alphabets, us is a set of k lowercase English alphabets, win is an empty set, ans is an empty list, ps is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i in us:
        win.add(i)
        if len(win) == k:
            ans.append(i)
            ps += 1
            win.clear()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string of length m consisting of the first k lowercase English alphabets that must have at least 1 character, us is a set of k lowercase English alphabets, if the first character i of the string s is in the set us, then the length of win is equal to k, win is an empty set, ans is a list containing the first character of the string s, ps is 1, and i is the first character in the string s and is also an element of the set us. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string of length m consisting of the first k lowercase English alphabets that must have at least 2 characters, us is a set of k lowercase English alphabets. If the second character i of the string s is in the set us, then the length of win is equal to k, win is an empty set, ans is a list containing the first and second characters of the string s, ps is 2, and i is the second character in the string s and is also an element of the set us. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string of length m consisting of the first k lowercase English alphabets that must have at least 3 characters, us is a set of k lowercase English alphabets. If the third character i of the string s is in the set us, then if the length of win is equal to k, win is an empty set, ans is a list containing the first, second, third and fourth characters of the string s, and ps is 4. Otherwise, no changes are made to win, ans, and ps. If the third character i of the string s is not in the set us, then no changes are made to the variables.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
