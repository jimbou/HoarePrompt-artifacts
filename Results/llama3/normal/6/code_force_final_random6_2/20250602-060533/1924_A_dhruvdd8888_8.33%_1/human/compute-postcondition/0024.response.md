To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the set `us`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `us` is not empty. Since `us` is a set of k lowercase English alphabets, we can adjust its state to ensure it has at least one element.

The state of `i` is not directly related to the loop execution, but since `i` is the last character in the string `s`, we can adjust its state to be any character in the set `us`.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is an empty string, us is a set of k lowercase English alphabets that must have at least 1 element, win is an empty set, ans is a list containing all the characters in the string s that are in the set us and appear in the string s after every k-1 characters that are in the set us, ps is equal to the number of times k characters in the set us appear in the string s consecutively, and i is any character in the set us, and the number of times k characters in the set us appear in the string s consecutively is less than n, and 'NO' is printed**
