Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is an empty string, us is a set of k lowercase English alphabets, win is an empty set, ans is a list containing all the characters in the string s that are in the set us and appear in the string s after every k-1 characters that are in the set us, ps is equal to the number of times k characters in the set us appear in the string s consecutively, and i is the last character in the string s. The number of times k characters in the set us appear in the string s consecutively is less than n, and 'NO' is printed
Code of the loop:
for i in us:
    if i not in win:
        print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is an empty string, us is a set of k lowercase English alphabets that must have at least 1 element, win is an empty set, ans is a list containing all the characters in the string s that are in the set us and appear in the string s after every k-1 characters that are in the set us, ps is equal to the number of times k characters in the set us appear in the string s consecutively, and the number of times k characters in the set us appear in the string s consecutively is less than n. If i is not in the set win, a string is printed that starts with all the characters in the string s that are in the set us and appear in the string s after every k-1 characters that are in the set us, followed by the current value of i, and then 'a' repeated n - len(ans) - 1 times. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is an empty string, us is a set of k lowercase English alphabets that must have at least 2 elements, win is an empty set, ans is a list containing all the characters in the string s that are in the set us and appear in the string s after every k-1 characters that are in the set us, ps is equal to the number of times k characters in the set us appear in the string s consecutively, and the number of times k characters in the set us appear in the string s consecutively is less than n. If i is not in the set win, a string is printed that starts with all the characters in the string s that are in the set us and appear in the string s after every k-1 characters that are in the set us, followed by the current value of i, and then 'a' repeated n - len(ans) - 1 times. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed, and i is another element in the set us.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is an empty string, us is a set of k lowercase English alphabets that must have at least 2 elements, win is an empty set, ans is a list containing all the characters in the string s that are in the set us and appear in the string s after every k-1 characters that are in the set us, ps is equal to the number of times k characters in the set us appear in the string s consecutively, and the number of times k characters in the set us appear in the string s consecutively is less than n. If i is not in the set win, a string is printed that starts with all the characters in the string s that are in the set us and appear in the string s after every k-1 characters that are in the set us, followed by the current value of i, and then 'a' repeated n - len(ans) - 1 times, where i is another element in the set us. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
