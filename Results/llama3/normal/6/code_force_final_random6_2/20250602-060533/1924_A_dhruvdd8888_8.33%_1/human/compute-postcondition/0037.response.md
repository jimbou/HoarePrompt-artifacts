Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is an empty string, us is an empty set, win is an empty set, ans is a list containing all the characters in the string s that are in the set us and appear in the string s after every k-1 characters that are in the set us, ps is equal to the number of times k characters in the set us appear in the string s consecutively, and the number of times k characters in the set us appear in the string s consecutively is less than n. If i is not in the set win, a string is printed that starts with all the characters in the string s that are in the set us and appear in the string s after every k-1 characters that are in the set us, followed by the current value of i, and then 'a' repeated n - len(ans) - 1 times. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the input stream (stdin) still contains t-1 test cases, the values of n, k, and m remain unchanged, the string s is still empty, the set us is now empty because all its elements have been processed, the set win is still empty, the list ans still contains all the characters in the string s that are in the set us and appear in the string s after every k-1 characters that are in the set us, the number of times k characters in the set us appear in the string s consecutively is still less than n, and for each element i in the set us, a string is printed that starts with all the characters in the string s that are in the set us and appear in the string s after every k-1 characters that are in the set us, followed by the current value of i, and then 'a' repeated n - len(ans) - 1 times, unless i is in the set win, in which case 'NO' is printed.
