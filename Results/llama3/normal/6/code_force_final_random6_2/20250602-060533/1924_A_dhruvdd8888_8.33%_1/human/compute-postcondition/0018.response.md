Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is an empty string, us is a set of k lowercase English alphabets, win is an empty set, ans is a list containing all the characters in the string s that are in the set us and appear in the string s after every k-1 characters that are in the set us, ps is equal to the number of times k characters in the set us appear in the string s consecutively, and i is the last character in the string s.**

This output state means that after the loop executes all the iterations, the string s will be empty because all its characters will have been processed. The set us will remain unchanged because it is not modified in the loop. The set win will be empty because it is cleared at the end of each iteration. The list ans will contain all the characters in the string s that are in the set us and appear in the string s after every k-1 characters that are in the set us. The variable ps will be equal to the number of times k characters in the set us appear in the string s consecutively. The variable i will be the last character in the string s.
