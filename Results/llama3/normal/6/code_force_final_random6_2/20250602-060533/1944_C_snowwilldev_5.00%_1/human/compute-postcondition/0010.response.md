To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `N`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `N`. If `N` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

State: **`tc` is 0, `N` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range(`N`), `i` is 0, `t` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs**
