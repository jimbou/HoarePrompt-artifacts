Postcondition: ***`tc` is 0, `N` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range(`N`), `i` is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. If `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and the value of `i` which is 1 is being printed.***
