The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `N`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `N` is greater than 1. At the for the `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `N` must be greater than 2.
State: **`tc` is 0, `N` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range(`N`), `i` is 2, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.**
