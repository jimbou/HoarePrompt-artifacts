Postcondition: **`N` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `N` integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[i]]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range `N`, `tc` is either 2 or 3, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus `N+1` inputs, `i` is `N`. If `cnt[i]` equals 1, then `t` is increased by 1.**
