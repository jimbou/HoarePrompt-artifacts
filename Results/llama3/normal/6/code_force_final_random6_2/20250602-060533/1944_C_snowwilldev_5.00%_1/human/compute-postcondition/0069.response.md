The only variable in the loop head is variable  tc, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tc`. If `tc` is less than the number of test cases, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `tc` is either 1 or 2, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus `N` inputs. For the loop to execute again `tc` must be increased by 1 and stdin must contain at least 1 test case minus `N` inputs.
State: **`N` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of `N` integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 where `cnt[a[i]]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range(`N`), `tc` is either 2 or 3, `i` is `N`, `t` is either `N` or `N+1`, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus `N` inputs**
