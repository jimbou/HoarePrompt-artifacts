Output State: **`tc` is 0, `N` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range(`N`), `i` is 1, `t` is 2, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. If `cnt[i]` is not 0, then the execution continues. If `cnt[i]` is 0, then the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. The values of the other variables remain the same. The execution will continue if `cnt[i]` is not 0, otherwise, it will break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
