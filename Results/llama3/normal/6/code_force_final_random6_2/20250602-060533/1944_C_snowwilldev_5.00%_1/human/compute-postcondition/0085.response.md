Output: **N is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of N integers, cnt is a dictionary with default value 0 and cnt[a[i]] is increased by 1 for all i in range N, tc is either 2 or 3, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus N+1 inputs. The current value of t is either greater than or equal to 2 or the current value of cnt[i] is 0, and the value of i is being printed, where i is an integer for which the current value of cnt[i] is 0 or the current value of t is greater than or equal to 2**
