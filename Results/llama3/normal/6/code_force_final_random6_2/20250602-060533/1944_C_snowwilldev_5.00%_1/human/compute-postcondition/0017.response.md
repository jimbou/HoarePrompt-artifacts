Output State: **`tc` is 0, `N` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range(`N`), `i` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `t` is either 2 or more, or `cnt[i]` is 0, if `cnt[i]` is 1, then `t` is 1, otherwise `t` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables `tc`, `N`, `a`, and `cnt` remain the same. The value of `i` is still 0. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. The value of `t` depends on the value of `cnt[i]`. If `cnt[i]` is 1, then `t` is 1. Otherwise, `t` is either 2 or more, or `cnt[i]` is 0. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
