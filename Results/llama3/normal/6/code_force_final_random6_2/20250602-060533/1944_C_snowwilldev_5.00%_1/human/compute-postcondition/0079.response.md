To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `N`. The loop will execute if `N` is at least 1. Since `i` is currently equal to `N`, we need to adjust `i` to be 0, which is the starting value of the range. The other variables are not directly related to the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`N` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `N` integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[i]]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range `N`, `tc` is either 2 or 3, `i` is 0, `t` is 0, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus `N+1` inputs**
