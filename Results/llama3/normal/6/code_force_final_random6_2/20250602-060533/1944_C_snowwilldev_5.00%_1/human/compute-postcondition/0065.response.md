Output: **`N` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `N` integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 where `cnt[a[i]]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range(`N`), `tc` is either 1 or 2, and stdin contains at least 1 test case minus `N` inputs. If `cnt[i]` is 1, `t` is either 3 or 4, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and the value of `i` which is 2 is being printed. Otherwise, no change occurs, `i` is 2, and the value of `i` which is 2 is being printed**
