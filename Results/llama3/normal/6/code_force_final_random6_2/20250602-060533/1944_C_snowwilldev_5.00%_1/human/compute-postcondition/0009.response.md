Output State: **tc is 0, N is greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of integers, cnt is a dictionary with default value 0 and cnt[a[i]] is incremented by 1 for all i in range(N), i is N-1, t is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of variable t is assigned to 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The variable tc is still 0, N is still greater than or equal to 0, a is still a list of integers, cnt is still a dictionary with default value 0 and cnt[a[i]] is incremented by 1 for all i in range(N), i is still N-1, and stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.
