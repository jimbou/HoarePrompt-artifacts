Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `N` integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 where `cnt[a[i]]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range(`N`), `tc` is either 1 or 2, `i` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus `N` inputs. If `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
