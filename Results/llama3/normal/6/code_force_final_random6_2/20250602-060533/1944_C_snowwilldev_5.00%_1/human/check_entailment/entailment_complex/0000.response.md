Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the optimal strategy for Alice to maximize the score of the game. The strategy is to find the smallest integer that appears only once in the list or is not present in the list. This is because Alice wants to maximize the MEX of her array c, and the MEX is the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array.

The program uses a dictionary cnt to count the occurrences of each integer in the list. It then iterates over the integers from 0 to N-1 and checks if the count of the current integer is 1 or 0. If the count is 1, it increments a variable t. If t is greater than or equal to 2 or the count is 0, it prints the current integer and breaks the loop.

This strategy is correct because if an integer appears only once in the list, Alice can pick it and Bob cannot pick it, so it will be included in Alice's array c. If an integer does not appear in the list, it will not be included in Alice's array c, so it will be the MEX of c. The program correctly finds the smallest such integer and prints it.

Correctness: **True**
