Output State: **`tc` is 0, `N` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range(`N`), `i` is 0, `t` is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. The current value of `cnt[i]` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `t` being 1. All other variables remain unchanged, with `tc` still being 0, `N` being greater than 0, `a` being a list of integers, `cnt` being a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[i]]` incremented by 1 for all `i` in range(`N`), `i` being 0, and stdin containing at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. Additionally, the current value of `cnt[i]` remains 1.
