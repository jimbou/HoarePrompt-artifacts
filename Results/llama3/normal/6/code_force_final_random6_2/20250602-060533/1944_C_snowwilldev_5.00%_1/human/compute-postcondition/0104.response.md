Output State: **tc is equal to the number of test cases, N is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of N integers, cnt is a dictionary with default value 0 where cnt[a[i]] is increased by 1 for all i in range(N), i is N, t is either 0, 1, or 2, stdin contains no more test cases.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the loop head variable `tc` will be equal to the number of test cases, and the loop body variables `N`, `a`, `cnt`, `i`, and `t` will have the same values as in the previous iterations. The only difference is that `stdin` will contain no more test cases, indicating that the loop has finished executing all the test cases.
