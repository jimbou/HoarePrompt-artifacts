Output State: **`i` is `N+1`, `N` is greater than 0, `t` is increased by 1, and the loop cannot execute again.**

In this output state, the value of `i` is increased by 1 to `N+1`, and the value of `N` remains greater than 0. The variable `t` is incremented by 1. Additionally, the loop cannot execute again because `i` is no longer less than `N`, and `N` cannot be greater than `N+1` since it is an integer greater than 0.
