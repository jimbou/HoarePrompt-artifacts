Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of `N` integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 where `cnt[a[i]]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range(`N`), `tc` is either 1 or 2, `i` is `N`, `t` is either `N` or `N+1`, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus `N` inputs. If `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and the value of `i` which is `N-1` is being printed. Otherwise, no change occurs.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `N`, and the value of `t` will be either `N` or `N+1`. The loop will break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0, and the value of `i` which is `N-1` will be printed. If neither of these conditions is met, no change will occur. The state of the other variables in the precondition remains unchanged.
