Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `N` integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 where `cnt[a[i]]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range(`N`), `tc` is either 1 or 2, `i` is 0, `t` is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus `N` inputs. The current value of `cnt[i]` is 1.**

The code increments the value of `t` by 1. The initial value of `t` was 0, so after the increment, `t` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus `N` inputs.
