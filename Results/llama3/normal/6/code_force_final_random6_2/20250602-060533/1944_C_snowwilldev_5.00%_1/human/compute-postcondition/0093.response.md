Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `N` integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[i]]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range `N`, `tc` is either 2 or 3, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus `N` inputs, `i` is `N`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `N` is still greater than 0, the list `a` still contains `N` integers, the dictionary `cnt` still has default value 0 and its values are still increased by 1 for each occurrence of elements in `a`. The value of `tc` is still either 2 or 3. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus `N` inputs. The value of `i` is still `N`. However, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside.
