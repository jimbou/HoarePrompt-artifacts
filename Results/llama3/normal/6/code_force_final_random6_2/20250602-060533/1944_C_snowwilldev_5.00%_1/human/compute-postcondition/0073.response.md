To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `N`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `N` is an integer greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `N`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, `i` should be 1 at the start of the next iteration. 

The state of `N` remains the same, as it is not modified within the loop.

State: **`N` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of `N` integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[0]]` is increased by 1, `tc` is either 2 or 3, `i` is 1, `t` is either `N` or `N+1`, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus `N+1` inputs**
