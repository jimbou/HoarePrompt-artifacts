Output State: **N is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of N integers, cnt is a dictionary with default value 0 and cnt[a[i]] is increased by 1 for all i in range N, tc is either 2 or 3, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus N+1 inputs, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of N integers, cnt is a dictionary with default value 0 and cnt[a[i]] is increased by 1 for all i in range N, tc is either 2 or 3, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus N+1 inputs, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
