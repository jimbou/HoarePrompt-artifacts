Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of `N` integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 where `cnt[a[i]]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range(`N`), `tc` is either 1 or 2, `i` is `N-1`, `t` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus `N` inputs.**

In this output state, a new variable `t` has been introduced and assigned the value 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The state of the stdin also remains the same, containing at least 1 test case minus `N` inputs.
