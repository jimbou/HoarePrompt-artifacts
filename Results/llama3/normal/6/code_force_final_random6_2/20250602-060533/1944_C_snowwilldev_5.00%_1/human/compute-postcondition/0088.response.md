The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `N`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `N-1` (because it started from 0), and `N` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is `N`, and for the loop to execute again `N` must be greater than `N`. But `N` is not changed, so `N` is still greater than 0.
State: **`N` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `N` integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[i]]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range `N`, `tc` is either 2 or 3, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus `N+1` inputs, `i` is `N`**
