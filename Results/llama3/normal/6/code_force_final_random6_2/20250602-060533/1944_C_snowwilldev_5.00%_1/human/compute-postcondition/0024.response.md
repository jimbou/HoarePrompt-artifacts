Output State: **`tc` is 0, `N` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range(`N`), `i` is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the value of `i` which is 1 is being printed**.

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `tc`, `N`, `a`, and `cnt` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still 1. The execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the value of `i` (which is 1) is being printed. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.
