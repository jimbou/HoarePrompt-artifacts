The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and N, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `N` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `N` must be greater than 1.
State: **`N` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `N` integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 where `cnt[a[i]]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range(`N`), `tc` is either 1 or 2, `i` is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus `N` inputs. If `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.**
