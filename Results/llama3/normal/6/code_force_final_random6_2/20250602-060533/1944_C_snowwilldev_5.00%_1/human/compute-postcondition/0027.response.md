Output State: **`tc` is 1, `N` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range(`N`), `i` is 2, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.**

The value of `tc` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.
