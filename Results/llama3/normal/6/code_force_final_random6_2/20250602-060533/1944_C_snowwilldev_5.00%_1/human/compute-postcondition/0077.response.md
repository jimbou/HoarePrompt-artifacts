Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of `N` integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[i]]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range `N`, `tc` is either 2 or 3, `i` is `N`, `t` is either `N` or `N+1`, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus `N+2` inputs**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: The loop has finished executing, and the count dictionary `cnt` now contains the frequency of each integer in the list `a`. The variable `i` has reached the value of `N`, indicating that the loop has iterated over all elements in the list `a`. The other variables `tc`, `t`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
