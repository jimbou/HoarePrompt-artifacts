Output State: **N is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of N integers, cnt is a dictionary with default value 0 where cnt[a[i]] is increased by 1 for all i in range(N), tc is either 1 or 2, i is N-1, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus N inputs**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is:

* The value of N remains the same as it was before the loop started.
* The list 'a' remains the same as it was before the loop started.
* The dictionary 'cnt' has been updated such that for each integer in the list 'a', its count in 'cnt' has been incremented by 1.
* The value of 'tc' remains the same as it was before the loop started.
* The value of 'i' is now N-1, which is the last index of the list 'a'.
* The stdin contains at least 1 test case minus N inputs, which means that the loop has consumed N inputs from the stdin.
