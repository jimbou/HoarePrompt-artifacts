To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head `for i in range(N):`. The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`.

Given that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`N` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `N` integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 where `cnt[a[i]]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range(`N`), `tc` is either 1 or 2, and stdin contains at least 1 test case minus `N` inputs. If `cnt[i]` is 1, `t` is either 2 or 3. If `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and the value of `i` which is 2 is being printed. Otherwise, no change occurs, `i` is 2**
