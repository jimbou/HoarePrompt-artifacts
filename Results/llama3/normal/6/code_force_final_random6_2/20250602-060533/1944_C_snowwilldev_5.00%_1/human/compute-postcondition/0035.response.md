The code snippet provided reads two lines of input from stdin: the first line contains an integer `N`, and the second line contains a list of `N` integers. The first line assigns the value of `N` to the variable `N`, overwriting its initial value. The second line assigns a list of `N` integers to the variable `a`, overwriting its initial value. The third line creates a new dictionary `cnt` with default value 0, overwriting its initial value.

Output State: **N is an integer, a is a list of N integers, cnt is a dictionary with default value 0, tc is either 1 or 2, i is not defined, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.**
