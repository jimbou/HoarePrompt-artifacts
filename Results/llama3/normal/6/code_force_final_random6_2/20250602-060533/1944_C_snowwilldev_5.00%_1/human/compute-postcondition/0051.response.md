Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `N` integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 where `cnt[a[i]]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range(`N`), `tc` is either 1 or 2, `i` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus `N` inputs, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their initial values, but the program breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement it was currently inside. The values of `N`, `a`, `cnt`, `tc`, and `i` remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus `N` inputs.
