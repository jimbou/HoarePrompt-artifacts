Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the final score of a game played between Alice and Bob. The game involves an array `a` of size `n`, where Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from the array and deleting them. Alice wants to maximize the score, which is defined as the MEX (minimum excludant) of the array `c` that Alice constructs by appending the elements she picks.

The program uses a dictionary `cnt` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`. It then iterates through the range of possible MEX values (from 0 to `n-1`) and checks if the count of each element is 1 or 0. If the count is 1, it increments a variable `t` to keep track of the number of elements with a count of 1. If `t` becomes greater than or equal to 2, or if the count of an element is 0, it prints the current MEX value and breaks out of the loop.

The reasoning behind this approach is as follows:

* If an element has a count of 1, it means that Alice can pick it and add it to her array `c`, which will increase the MEX value.
* If an element has a count of 0, it means that Bob can pick it and delete it from the array `a`, which will not affect the MEX value.
* If `t` becomes greater than or equal to 2, it means that Alice has picked at least two elements with a count of 1, which will increase the MEX value to at least 2. In this case, the program prints the current MEX value and breaks out of the loop.

The program correctly implements the logic of the game and finds the final score by iterating through the possible MEX values and checking the counts of the elements in the array `a`.

Correctness: **True**
