Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `N` integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[i]]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range `N`, `tc` is either 2 or 3, `i` is 0, `t` is 1, `cnt[i]` is 1, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus `N+1` inputs.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is incremented by 1, resulting in `t` being 1. The other variables remain unchanged, with `N` still being an integer greater than 0, `a` still being a list of `N` integers, `cnt` still being a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[i]]` increased by 1 for all `i` in range `N`, `tc` still being either 2 or 3, `i` still being 0, and `cnt[i]` still being 1. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus `N+1` inputs.
