Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `N` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of `N` integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[i]]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range `N`, `tc` is either 2 or 3, `i` is `N`, `t` is 0, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus `N+1` inputs
Code of the loop:
for i in range(N):
    if cnt[i] == 1:
        t += 1
    if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
        print(i)
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *N is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of N integers, cnt is a dictionary with default value 0 and cnt[a[i]] is increased by 1 for all i in range N, tc is either 2 or 3, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus N+1 inputs. If t is less than 2 and cnt[i] is not 0, no changes are made to t and i. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`N` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `N` integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[i]]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range `N`, `tc` is either 2 or 3, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus `N` inputs, `i` is `N`. If `t` is less than 2 and `cnt[i]` is not equal to 0, then the function continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is `N+1`, `N` is greater than 0. If `t` is less than 2 and `cnt[i]` is 1, `t` is increased by 1, the value of `i` which is `N+1` is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
