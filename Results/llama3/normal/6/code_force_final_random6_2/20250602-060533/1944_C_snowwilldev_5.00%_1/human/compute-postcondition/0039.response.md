Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `N` integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 where `cnt[a[0]]` is increased by 1 and `cnt[a[1]]` is increased by 1, `tc` is either 1 or 2, `i` is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs**

In this output state, the value of `cnt[a[1]]` is increased by 1 because `i` is 1 and `cnt[a[i]]` is increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs because no input operation is performed in the given code.
