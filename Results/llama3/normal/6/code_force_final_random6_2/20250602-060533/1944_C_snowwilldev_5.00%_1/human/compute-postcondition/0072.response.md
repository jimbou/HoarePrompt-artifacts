Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of `N` integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[0]]` is increased by 1, `tc` is either 2 or 3, `i` is 0, `t` is either `N` or `N+1`, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus `N+1` inputs**

In this output state, the value of `cnt[a[0]]` is increased by 1, because `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 and `i` is 0. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin contains at least 1 test case minus `N+1` inputs, because one input is consumed by `a[i]`.
