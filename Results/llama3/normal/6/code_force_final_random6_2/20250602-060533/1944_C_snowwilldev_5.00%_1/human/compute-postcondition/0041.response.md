Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of `N` integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 where `cnt[a[0]]` is increased by 1, `cnt[a[1]]` is increased by 1 and `cnt[a[2]]` is increased by 1, `tc` is either 1 or 2, `i` is 2, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs**

In this output state, the value of `cnt[a[2]]` has been increased by 1 because `i` is 2 and `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin now contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs because we have already processed 2 inputs.
