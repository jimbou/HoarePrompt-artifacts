The value of `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1. The value of `a[i]` is an integer from the list `a` at index `i`, which is 1. The value of `cnt[a[0]]` was incremented by 1 before, but now the value of `cnt[a[1]]` is incremented by 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.
Output State: **`tc` is 0, `N` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0, `cnt[a[0]]` is 1, `cnt[a[1]]` is 1, `i` is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs**
