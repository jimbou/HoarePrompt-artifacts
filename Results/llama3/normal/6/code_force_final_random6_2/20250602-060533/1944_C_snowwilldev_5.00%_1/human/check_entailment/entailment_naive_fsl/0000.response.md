Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly implements the game's strategy to maximize the score. It uses a dictionary to count the occurrences of each number in the array. Then, it iterates through the numbers from 0 to N-1 and checks if the count of the current number is 1. If it is, it increments a counter `t`. If `t` becomes 2 or the count of the current number is 0, it prints the current number as the final score.

The program's logic is correct because it takes advantage of the fact that Alice can always choose a number that will make the MEX of her array increase. If a number appears only once in the array, Alice can choose it and increase the MEX. If a number appears twice, Bob can choose one of them and prevent Alice from increasing the MEX. Therefore, the program correctly identifies the maximum possible MEX that Alice can achieve.

The program also handles the edge cases correctly. For example, if the input array is `[0, 1, 2, 3]`, the program correctly outputs `1` as the final score, because Alice can choose the number 0 and increase the MEX to 1. Similarly, if the input array is `[1, 1]`, the program correctly outputs `0` as the final score, because Alice cannot increase the MEX beyond 0.

Overall, the program is correct and implements the optimal strategy for the game.
