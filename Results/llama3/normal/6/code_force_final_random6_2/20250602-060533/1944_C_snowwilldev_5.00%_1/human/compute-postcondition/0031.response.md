Output State: **`tc` is either 0 or 1, `N` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range(`N`), `i` is 2, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `tc` is either 0 or 1, the value of `N` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range(`N`), `i` is 2, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
