Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of `N` integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[0]]` is increased by 1 and `cnt[a[1]]` is increased by 1 and `cnt[a[2]]` is increased by 1 and `cnt[a[2]]` is increased by 1, `tc` is either 2 or 3, `i` is 2, `t` is either `N` or `N+1`, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus `N+2` inputs**

The code increments the count of `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt` by 1. Since `i` is 2, the count of `a[2]` is increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
