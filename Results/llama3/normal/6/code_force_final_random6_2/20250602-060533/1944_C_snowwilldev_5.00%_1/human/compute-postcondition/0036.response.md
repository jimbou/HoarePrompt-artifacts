To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `N`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `N`. If `N` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `N` is an integer, but it does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `N` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.

State: **`N` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `N` integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0, `tc` is either 1 or 2, `i` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs**
