Output State: **`i` is `N+1`, `N` is greater than 0, `cnt[i]` is 1, `t` is increased by 1, the value of `i` which is `N+1` is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` is still `N+1`, `N` is still greater than 0, the count at index `i` is 1, the value of `t` has been increased by 1, the value of `i` which is `N+1` has been printed, and we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
