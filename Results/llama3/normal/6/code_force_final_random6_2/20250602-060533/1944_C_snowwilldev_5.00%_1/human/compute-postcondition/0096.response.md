The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `N`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `N`, `N` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is `N+1` and for the loop to execute again `N` must be greater than `N+1`. However, `N` cannot be greater than `N+1` because `N` is an integer greater than 0. Therefore, the loop cannot execute again.
