To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `N`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `N` is greater than 1.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Additionally, for the loop to execute again, `N` must be greater than 2.

State: **`tc` is 0, `N` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0, `cnt[a[0]]` is 1, `cnt[a[1]]` is 1, `i` is 2, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs**
