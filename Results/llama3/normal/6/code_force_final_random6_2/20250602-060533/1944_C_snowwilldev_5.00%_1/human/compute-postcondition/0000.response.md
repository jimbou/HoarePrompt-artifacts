The only variable in the loop head is `tc`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tc` and the input from `stdin`. If `stdin` contains at least 1 test case, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `stdin` contains multiple test cases, but it does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `stdin` contains at least 1 test case and `tc` is 0.

State: **`stdin` contains at least 1 test case, `tc` is 0**
