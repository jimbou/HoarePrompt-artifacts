Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of an integer `N` and a list of `N` integers `a`.

2. It then counts the occurrences of each integer in the list `a` using a dictionary `cnt`.

3. The program then iterates over the range of `N` and checks if the count of the current integer `i` is 1. If it is, it increments a variable `t`. If `t` becomes greater than or equal to 2, or if the count of `i` is 0, it prints `i` and breaks the loop.

4. The reasoning behind this is that Alice wants to maximize the score (MEX of `c`), and Bob wants to minimize it. If there are two or more integers that appear only once in the list `a`, Alice can pick one of them and Bob can pick the other, resulting in a MEX of at least 2. If there is only one integer that appears only once, Alice can pick it and Bob can pick any other integer, resulting in a MEX of at least 1. If there are no integers that appear only once, the MEX is 0.

5. The program correctly handles the case where `N` is 0, in which case the MEX is also 0.

6. The program also correctly handles the case where `N` is 1, in which case the MEX is 1 if the single integer is 0, and 0 otherwise.

7. The program does not have any syntax errors or logical errors that would prevent it from producing the correct output.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
