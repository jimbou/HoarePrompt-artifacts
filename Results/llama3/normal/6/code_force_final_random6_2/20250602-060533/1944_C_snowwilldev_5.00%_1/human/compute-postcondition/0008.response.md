Output State: **tc is 0, N is greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of integers, cnt is a dictionary with default value 0 and cnt[a[i]] is incremented by 1 for all i in range(N), i is N-1, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `tc` remains unchanged at 0, the variable `N` is greater than or equal to 0 (since the loop will not execute if `N` is less than 0), the list `a` remains unchanged, the dictionary `cnt` has its default value of 0 and the count of each element in the list `a` is incremented by 1, the variable `i` is equal to `N-1` (since the loop iterates `N` times), and the input stream `stdin` still contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.
