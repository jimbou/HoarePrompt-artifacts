Postcondition: ***N is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of N integers, cnt is a dictionary with default value 0 and cnt[a[i]] is increased by 1 for all i in range N, tc is either 2 or 3, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus N+1 inputs. If cnt[i] is 1, then t is 1 and i is 0. Otherwise, no changes are made to t and i.***
