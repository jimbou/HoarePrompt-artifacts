Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `N` integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[i]]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range `N`, `tc` is either 2 or 3, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus `N+1` inputs, `i` is `N`, `t` is increased by 1**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been incremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The dictionary `cnt` still contains the count of each integer in the list `a`, and the list `a` itself remains the same. The value of `tc` is still either 2 or 3, and the number of inputs in `stdin` is still at least 1 test case minus `N+1` inputs. The value of `i` is still `N`.
