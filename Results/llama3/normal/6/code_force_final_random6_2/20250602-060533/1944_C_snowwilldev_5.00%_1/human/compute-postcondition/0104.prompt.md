Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. The first line of stdin contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 2 * 10^4) — the number of test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5). The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 <= a_i < n).
Code of the loop:
for tc in range(int(input())):
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
    t = 0
    for i in range(N):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
            print(i)
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tc` is either 0 or 1, `N` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range(`N`), `i` is `N-1`, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `N` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of `N` integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 where `cnt[a[i]]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range(`N`), `tc` is either 1 or 2, `i` is `N`, `t` is either `N` or `N+1`, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus `N` inputs. If `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and the value of `i` which is `N-1` is being printed. Otherwise, no change occurs.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `N`, `t` is either 0, 1, or 2, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[i]]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range `N`, `a` is a list of `N` integers, `N` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `tc` is either 2 or 3, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus `N+1` inputs.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
