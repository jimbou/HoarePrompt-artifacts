Postcondition: ***N is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of N integers, cnt is a dictionary with default value 0 and cnt[a[i]] is increased by 1 for all i in range N, tc is either 2 or 3, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus N+1 inputs. If t is less than 2 and cnt[i] is not 0, no changes are made to t and i. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
