Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `N` integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 where `cnt[a[i]]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range(`N`), `tc` is either 1 or 2, `i` is 1, `t` is either 2 or 3, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus `N` inputs. If `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is incremented by 1, so it becomes either 2 or 3. The values of `N`, `a`, `cnt`, `tc`, and `i` remain the same. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus `N` inputs. The condition for breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement is still dependent on the values of `t` and `cnt[i]`.
