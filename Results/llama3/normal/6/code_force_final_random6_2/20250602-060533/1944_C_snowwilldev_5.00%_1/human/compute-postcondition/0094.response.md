Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `N` integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[i]]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range `N`, `tc` is either 2 or 3, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus `N` inputs, `i` is `N`. If `t` is less than 2 and `cnt[i]` is not equal to 0, then the function continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
