The code increments the count of the element at index `i` in the list `a` in the dictionary `cnt`. The value of `a[i]` is unknown, but it is an integer. The count of `a[i]` in `cnt` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`tc` is 0, `N` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[0]]` is incremented by 1, `i` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs**
