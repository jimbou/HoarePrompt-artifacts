Postcondition: ***`tc` is 0, `N` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range(`N`), `i` is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. If `cnt[i]` is 1, then `t` is 2 and the execution continues if `cnt[i]` is not 0, otherwise the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
