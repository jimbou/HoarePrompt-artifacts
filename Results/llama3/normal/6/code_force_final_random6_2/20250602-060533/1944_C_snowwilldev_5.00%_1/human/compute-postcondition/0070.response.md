Output State: **N is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of N integers, cnt is a dictionary with default value 0, tc is either 2 or 3, i is N, t is either N or N+1, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus N+2 inputs**

The code block consists of three lines. The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to N. The second line reads a list of N integers from stdin and assigns it to a. The third line initializes a dictionary cnt with default value 0.

After the execution of the code block, the value of N is updated to the integer read from stdin. The list a is updated to the list of N integers read from stdin. The dictionary cnt is initialized with default value 0, but its values are not updated yet. The values of tc, i, and t remain unchanged. The stdin contains at least 1 test case minus N+2 inputs, as two inputs have been read by the code.
