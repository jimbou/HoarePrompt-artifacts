Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the result. It accepts an integer t, representing the number of test cases, followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and m, a list of n integers a, and a string t of length n containing 'L' and 'R' characters. The function calculates a list of n integers y, where each element y[i] is the product of the corresponding element in a and the previous element in y, modulo m, based on the direction specified by the character in t. The function then prints the list y for each test case.**
