Output State: **n is at least 3, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is the number of 'L' characters in t, y is a list of n integers where all elements are 0 except the last one which is k * a[q2] % m, k is k * a[q2] % m, q1 is either l - 2 or l - 1, q2 is either l + 1 or l + 2 depending on whether the last character of t is 'L', stdin is empty, i is n - 2, and the character at index i in string t is 'R'.**

In this output state, the value of k has been updated to k * a[q2] % m, and q2 has been incremented by 1. The value of y has also been updated to reflect the new value of k. All other variables remain unchanged.
