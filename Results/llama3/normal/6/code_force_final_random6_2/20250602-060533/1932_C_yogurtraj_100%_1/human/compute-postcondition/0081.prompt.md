Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4), then t test cases. Each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains two integers n and m (1 <= n <= 2*10^5, 1 <= m <= 10^4). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^4). The third line contains a string s of length n consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'.
Code of the loop:
for ii in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    t = input()
    l = t.count('L')
    k = 0
    q1 = 0
    q2 = 0
    if t[-1] == 'L':
        k = a[l - 1] % m
        q1 = l - 2
        q2 = l
    else:
        k = a[l] % m
        q1 = l - 1
        q2 = l + 1
    y = [0] * n
    y[-1] = k
    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
        if t[i] == 'R':
            k = k * a[q2] % m
            q2 += 1
        else:
            k = k * a[q1] % m
            q1 -= 1
        y[i] = k
    print(*y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is the number of 'L' characters in t, y is a list of n integers where all elements are 0 except the first one which is k * a[q] % m, k is k * a[q] % m, q is either q1 or q2 depending on whether the character at index i in string t is 'R' or not, q1 is either l - 2, l - 1, l - 3 or l - 2 depending on whether the last character of t is 'L' and the character at index i in string t is 'R' or not, q2 is either l + 2, l + 3, l + 3 or l + 4 depending on whether the last character of t is 'L' and the character at index i in string t is 'R' or not, stdin is empty, i is -1, and the list y is printed which contains n integers where all elements are 0 except the first one which is k * a[q] % m.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is the number of 'L' characters in t, y is a list of n integers where all elements are k * a[q2] % m if the character at index i in string t is 'R', or k if the character at index i in string t is not 'R', k is either k * a[q2] % m if the character at index i in string t is 'R', or (a[l - 1] % m) * a[q1] % m if the last character of t is 'L' and the character at index i in string t is not 'R', or (a[l] % m) * a[q1] % m if the last character of t is not 'L' and the character at index i in string t is not 'R', q is either l - 2 or l if the last character of t is 'L' and the character at index i in string t is 'R', or q1 or q2 if the last character of t is not 'L' and the character at index i in string t is 'R' or not, q1 is either l - 2 if the last character of t is 'L', or l - 1 if the last character of t is not 'L', q2 is either l + 1 if the last character of t is 'L', or l + 2 if the last character of t is not 'L', stdin is empty, i is -1, y[i] is k, and the list of integers y is printed, where y[i] is k and the elements of y are either k * a[q2] % m if the character at index i in string t is 'R', or k if the character at index i in string t is not 'R'

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer that must be at least 1, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is the number of 'L' characters in t, k is either (a[l - 1] % m) * a[q2] % m if the last character of t is 'L', or (a[l] % m) * a[q2] % m if the last character of t is not 'L', q is either l - 2 or l if the last character of t is 'L' and the character at index i in string t is 'R', or q1 or q2 if the last character of t is not 'L' and the character at index i in string t is 'R' or not, q1 is either l - 2 if the last character of t is 'L', or l - 1 if the last character of t is not 'L', q2 is either l + (n - 2) if the last character of t is 'L', or l + (n - 1) if the last character of t is not 'L', stdin is empty, i is -1, y is a list of n integers where all elements are 0 except the one at index i which is k, and this is printed: a list of n integers where all elements are 0 except the one at index i which is k




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
