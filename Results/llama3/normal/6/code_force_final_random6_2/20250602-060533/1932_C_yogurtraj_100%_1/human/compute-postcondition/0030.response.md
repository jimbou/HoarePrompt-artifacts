Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is the number of 'L' characters in t, y is a list of n integers where all elements are 0 except the first one which is k * a[q] % m, k is k * a[q] % m, q is either q1 or q2 depending on whether the character at index i in string t is 'R' or not, q1 is either l - 2, l - 1, l - 3 or l - 2 depending on whether the last character of t is 'L' and the character at index i in string t is 'R' or not, q2 is either l + 2, l + 3, l + 3 or l + 4 depending on whether the last character of t is 'L' and the character at index i in string t is 'R' or not, stdin is empty, i is 0, and the list y is printed which contains n integers where all elements are 0 except the first one which is k * a[q] % m**

The final state of the program is as follows: The variables n and m are assigned integer values from the input. The list a is assigned a list of integers from the input. The string t is assigned a string value from the input. The variable l is assigned the count of 'L' characters in string t. The variable k is initialized to 0. The variables q1 and q2 are initialized to 0. The list y is printed, containing n integers where all elements are 0 except the first one, which is k * a[q] % m. The variable q is either q1 or q2, depending on whether the character at index i in string t is 'R' or not. The variable q1 is either l - 2, l - 1, l - 3, or l - 2, depending on whether the last character of t is 'L' and the character at index i in string t is 'R' or not. The variable q2 is either l + 2, l + 3, l + 3, or l + 4, depending on whether the last character of t is 'L' and the character at index i in string t is 'R' or not. Stdin is empty, and the variable i is 0.
