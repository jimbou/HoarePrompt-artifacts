Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` integers where all elements are 0 except the last one which is `k * a[q2] % m` if the character at index `i` in string `t` is 'R', or `k` if the character at index `i` in string `t` is not 'R', `k` is either `k * a[q2] % m` if the character at index `i` in string `t` is 'R', or `(a[l - 1] % m) * a[q1] % m` if the last character of `t` is 'L' and the character at index `i` in string `t` is not 'R', or `(a[l] % m) * a[q1] % m` if the last character of `t` is not 'L' and the character at index `i` in string `t` is not 'R', `q` is either `l - 2` or `l` if the last character of `t` is 'L' and the character at index `i` in string `t` is 'R', or `q1` or `q2` if the last character of `t` is not 'L' and the character at index `i` in string `t` is 'R' or not, `q1` is either `l - 2` if the last character of `t` is 'L', or `l - 1` if the last character of `t` is not 'L', `q2` is either `l + 1` if the last character of `t` is 'L', or `l + 2` if the last character of `t` is not 'L', `stdin` is empty, `i` is `n-2`, `y[i]` is `k`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `y[i]` has been updated to `k`, where `i` is `n-2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
