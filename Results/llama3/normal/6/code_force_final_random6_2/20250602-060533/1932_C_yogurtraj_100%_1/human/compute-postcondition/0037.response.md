Output State: **n is at least 3, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is the number of 'L' characters in t, y is a list of n integers where all elements are 0 except the last one which is k * a[q2] % m, k is k * a[q2] % m, q is either l - 2 or l if the last character of t is 'L' and the character at index i in string t is 'R', or q1 or q2 if the last character of t is not 'L' and the character at index i in string t is 'R' or not, q1 is either l - 2 if the last character of t is 'L', or l - 1 if the last character of t is not 'L', q2 is either l + 1 if the last character of t is 'L', or l + 2 if the last character of t is not 'L', stdin is empty, i is n-2, and the character at index i in string t is 'R'.**

In this final state, the value of `k` has been updated to be the result of `k * a[q2] % m`, which is then assigned to the last element of the list `y`. The value of `q2` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
