Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `k` is either `(a[l - 1] % m)` if the last character of `t` is 'L', or `(a[l] % m)` if the last character of `t` is not 'L', `q` is either `l - 2` or `l` if the last character of `t` is 'L' and the character at index `i` in string `t` is 'R', or `q1` or `q2` if the last character of `t` is not 'L' and the character at index `i` in string `t` is 'R' or not, `q1` is either `l - 2` if the last character of `t` is 'L', or `l - 1` if the last character of `t` is not 'L', `q2` is either `l` if the last character of `t` is 'L', or `l + 1` if the last character of `t` is not 'L', `stdin` is empty, `i` is `n - 2`, `y` is a list of `n` integers where all elements are 0 except the last one which is `k`. The current value of `t[i]` is 'R'.***
