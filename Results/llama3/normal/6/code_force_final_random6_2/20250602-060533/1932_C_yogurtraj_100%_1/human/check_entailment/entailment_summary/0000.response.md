Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program reads the input correctly, including the number of test cases, the length of the array `n`, the modulus `m`, the array `a`, and the string of commands `t`.
2.  It initializes the variables `l`, `k`, `q1`, and `q2` correctly based on the last command in the string `t`.
3.  It creates a list `y` of length `n` to store the results and initializes the last element of `y` with the value of `k`.
4.  The program then iterates over the commands in reverse order (from `n-2` to `0`). For each command, it updates the value of `k` by multiplying it with the corresponding element in `a` and taking the modulus `m`. The element in `a` is chosen based on the command ('L' or 'R') and the current values of `q1` and `q2`.
5.  The program correctly updates the values of `q1` and `q2` based on the command.
6.  Finally, the program prints the list `y` for each test case, which contains the desired results.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and produces the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
