This function reads input from standard input, processes it, and prints the results. It expects the input to contain an integer t, followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of three lines: two integers n and m, a list of n integers a, and a string t of length n containing 'L' and 'R' characters. The function calculates a list y of n integers based on the input values and prints the elements of y. The calculation involves iterating over the string t from right to left, updating values based on the characters in t and the corresponding values in a, and applying modulo operations with m. The final state of the program is that the calculated list y is printed, and the input values are not modified.
