According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ii` and the input from `stdin`. If the input from `stdin` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4), so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and `ii` is now 0. 
State: **`stdin` contains an integer `t` that must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0**
