Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` integers where all elements are 0 except the last one which is `k * a[q] % m` and the second last one which is `k`, `k` is `k * a[q] % m`, `q` is either `q1` or `q2` depending on whether the character at index `i` in string `t` is 'R' or not, `q1` is either `l - 2`, `l - 1`, `l - 3` or `l - 2` depending on whether the last character of `t` is 'L' and the character at index `i` in string `t` is 'R' or not, `q2` is either `l`, `l + 1`, `l + 1` or `l + 2` depending on whether the last character of `t` is 'L' and the character at index `i` in string `t` is 'R' or not, `stdin` is empty, `i` is `n - 2`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `y` at index `i` (which is the second last element) is updated to `k`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The list `y` now has all elements as 0 except the last one which is `k * a[q] % m` and the second last one which is `k`.
