The `print(*y)` statement will print the elements of the list `y`. The list `y` contains `n` integers, where all elements are 0 except the one at index `i` which is `k`.

Since `i` is -1, it is out of range for the list `y` (which has indices from 0 to `n-1`). Therefore, the list `y` will not have any element at index `i` equal to `k`. Instead, all elements of `y` will be 0.

Output: **0 0 0 ... 0 (n times)**
