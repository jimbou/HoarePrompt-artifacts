Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` integers where all elements are 0 except the last one which is `k * a[q] % m`, the second last one which is `k` if `t[i]` is 'L', or `k * a[q] % m` if `t[i]` is 'R', and the element at index `i` which is `k`, `k` is `k * a[q] % m` if `t[i]` is 'R', or `k * a[q1] % m * a[q1] % m` if `t[i]` is 'L', `q` is either `q1` or `q2` depending on whether the character at index `i` in string `t` is 'R' or not, `q1` is either `l - 2`, `l - 1`, `l - 3` or `l - 2` depending on whether the last character of `t` is 'L' and the character at index `i` in string `t` is 'R' or not, `q2` is either `l + 2`, `l + 3`, `l + 3` or `l + 4` depending on whether the last character of `t` is 'L' and the character at index `i` in string `t` is 'R' or not, `stdin` is empty, `i` is `n - 4`, and `y[i]` is `k`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `y[i]` has been updated to `k`, where `i` is `n - 4`. All other variables remain unchanged.
