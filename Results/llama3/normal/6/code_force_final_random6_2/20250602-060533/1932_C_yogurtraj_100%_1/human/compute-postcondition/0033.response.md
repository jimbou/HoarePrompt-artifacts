Postcondition: **n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is the number of 'L' characters in t, y is a list of n integers where all elements are 0 except the first one which is either a[l - 1] * a[q] % m if the last character of t is 'L', or k * a[q] % m if the last character of t is not 'L', k is either a[l - 1] % m if the last character of t is 'L', or a[l] % m if the last character of t is not 'L', q is either l - 2 or l if the last character of t is 'L' and the character at index i in string t is 'R', or q1 or q2 if the last character of t is not 'L' and the character at index i in string t is 'R' or not, q1 is either l - 2 if the last character of t is 'L', or l - 1 if the last character of t is not 'L', q2 is either l if the last character of t is 'L', or l + 1 if the last character of t is not 'L', stdin is empty, i is 0, and the list y is printed which contains n integers where all elements are 0 except the first one which is either a[l - 1] * a[q] % m if the last character of t is 'L', or k * a[q] % m if the last character of t is not 'L'.**
