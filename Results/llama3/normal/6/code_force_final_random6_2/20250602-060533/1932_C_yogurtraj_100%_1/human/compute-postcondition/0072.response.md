Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `k` is either (a[l - 1] % m) * a[q2] % m if the last character of `t` is 'L', or (a[l] % m) * a[q2] % m if the last character of `t` is not 'L', `q` is either l - 2 or l if the last character of `t` is 'L' and the character at index i in string `t` is 'R', or q1 or q2 if the last character of `t` is not 'L' and the character at index i in string `t` is 'R' or not, `q1` is either l - 2 if the last character of `t` is 'L', or l - 1 if the last character of `t` is not 'L', `q2` is either l + 1 if the last character of `t` is 'L', or l + 2 if the last character of `t` is not 'L', `stdin` is empty, `i` is n - 3, `y` is a list of n integers where all elements are 0 except the one at index i which is k, and the last one which is (a[l - 1] % m) * a[q2] % m if the last character of `t` is 'L' and the character at index i in string `t` is 'R', or (a[l] % m) * a[q2] % m if the last character of `t` is not 'L' and the character at index i in string `t` is 'R', or k * a[q1] % m if the last character of `t` is 'L' and the character at index i in string `t` is not 'R', or k * a[q1] % m if the last character of `t` is not 'L' and the character at index i in string `t` is not 'R'.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `y[i]` has been updated to `k`. All other variables remain unchanged.
