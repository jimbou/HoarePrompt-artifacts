Postcondition: **n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is the number of 'L' characters in t, y is a list of n integers where all elements are k * a[q2] % m if the character at index i in string t is 'R', or k if the character at index i in string t is not 'R', k is either (a[l - 1] % m) if the last character of t is 'L', or (a[l] % m) if the last character of t is not 'L', q is either l - 2 or l if the last character of t is 'L' and the character at index i in string t is 'R', or q1 or q2 if the last character of t is not 'L' and the character at index i in string t is 'R' or not, q1 is either l - 2 if the last character of t is 'L', or l - 1 if the last character of t is not 'L', q2 is either l if the last character of t is 'L', or l + 1 if the last character of t is not 'L', stdin is empty, i is 0, y[i] is k, and the list of integers y is not printed.**
