To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 3, because the loop starts from `n - 2` and goes down to `-1`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be at least 3.

State: **`n` is at least 3, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` integers where all elements are 0 except the last one which is `k`, `k` is either `a[l - 1] % m` or `a[l] % m` depending on whether the last character of `t` is 'L', `q1` is either `l - 2` or `l - 1`, `q2` is either `l` or `l + 1` depending on whether the last character of `t` is 'L', `stdin` is empty, `i` is `n - 2`**
