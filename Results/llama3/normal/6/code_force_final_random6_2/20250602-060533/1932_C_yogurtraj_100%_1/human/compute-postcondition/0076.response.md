Postcondition: **n is an integer that must be at least 4, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is the number of 'L' characters in t, k is either (a[l - 1] % m) * a[q2] % m if the last character of t is 'L', or (a[l] % m) * a[q2] % m if the last character of t is not 'L', q is either l - 2 or l if the last character of t is 'L' and the character at index i in string t is 'R', or q1 or q2 if the last character of t is not 'L' and the character at index i in string t is 'R' or not, q1 is either l - 2 if the last character of t is 'L', or l - 1 if the last character of t is not 'L', q2 is either l + 1 if the last character of t is 'L', or l + 2 if the last character of t is not 'L', stdin is empty, i is n - 4, y is a list of n integers where all elements are 0 except the one at index i which is k, and the last one which is (a[l - 1] % m) * a[q2] % m if the last character of t is 'L' and the character at index i in string t is 'R', or (a[l] % m) * a[q2] % m if the last character of t is not 'L' and the character at index i in string t is 'R', or k * a[q1] % m if the last character of t is 'L' and the character at index i in string t is not 'R', or k * a[q1] % m if the last character of t is not 'L' and the character at index i in string t is not 'R'. If t[i] is 'R', then k is multiplied by a[q2] % m. Otherwise, the element at index i in y is multiplied by a[q1] % m.**
