Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible for Bob to set up the store such that Alice buys exactly k jewels. The program checks two conditions: if n equals k, and if n + 2 is greater than k * 2. If either of these conditions is true, it prints 'YES' followed by the appropriate output. If neither condition is true, it prints 'NO'. The program correctly handles the edge cases and the general cases as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
