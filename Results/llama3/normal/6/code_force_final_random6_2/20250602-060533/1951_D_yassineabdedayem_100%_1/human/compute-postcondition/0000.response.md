The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by `t` lines, each containing two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n, k <= 10^18). So, `t` is assigned the value of the first integer in the stdin. The remaining input in the stdin is `t` lines, each containing two positive integers `n` and `k`. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains `t` lines, each containing two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n, k <= 10^18)**
