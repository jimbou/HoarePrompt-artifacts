Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 999, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are positive integers (1 <= n, k <= 10^18), stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n, k <= 10^18). If `n` equals `k`, 'YES' is printed, and the number 1 is printed. If `n` is not equal to `k`, then if `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, the difference between `n` and `k` plus 1 is printed, and 1 is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
