The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each case consists of two positive integers n and k. It then determines whether it is possible to satisfy a certain condition based on the values of n and k. If n equals k, it prints 'YES' followed by the number 1. If n does not equal k, it checks if n + 2 is greater than k * 2. If this condition is true, it prints 'YES', followed by the number 2, the difference between n and k plus 1, and finally the number 1. If neither of these conditions is true, it prints 'NO'. The function repeats this process for each test case.
