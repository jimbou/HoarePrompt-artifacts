Output State: **`t` is 0, `_` is `t`, `n` and `k` are the values from the last line of stdin, stdin is empty. If `n` equals `k`, 'YES' is printed, followed by the number 1 printed `t` times. If `n` is not equal to `k`, then if `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, 'YES' is printed, followed by the number 2 printed `t-1` times, the difference between `n` and `k` plus 1 printed `t-1` times, and finally the number 1 printed `t` times. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed `t` times.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `t` becomes 0, and the value of `_` becomes equal to the initial value of `t`. The values of `n` and `k` are the values from the last line of stdin. Stdin is empty because all lines have been read. The output depends on the values of `n` and `k`. If `n` equals `k`, 'YES' is printed, followed by the number 1 printed `t` times. If `n` is not equal to `k`, then if `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, 'YES' is printed, followed by the number 2 printed `t-1` times, the difference between `n` and `k` plus 1 printed `t-1` times, and finally the number 1 printed `t` times. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed `t` times.
