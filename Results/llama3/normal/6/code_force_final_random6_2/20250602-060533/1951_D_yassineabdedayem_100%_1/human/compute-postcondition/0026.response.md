Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 999, `_` is 1, `n` and `k` are positive integers (1 <= n, k <= 10^18), `n` and `k` are the values from the first line of stdin, stdin contains `t-3` lines, each containing two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n, k <= 10^18).**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged. The values of `n` and `k` are updated to be the positive integers from the first line of stdin. The stdin now contains `t-3` lines, each containing two positive integers `n` and `k`, since one line has been read.
