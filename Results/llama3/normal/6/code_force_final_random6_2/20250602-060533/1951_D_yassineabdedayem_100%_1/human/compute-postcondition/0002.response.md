Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 999, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are positive integers (1 <= n, k <= 10^18), stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n, k <= 10^18)**

In this output state, the value of `t` is decreased by 1 because one line has been read from stdin. The values of `n` and `k` are assigned the values of the two positive integers from the first line of stdin. The value of `_` remains 0. The stdin now contains `t-1` lines, each containing two positive integers `n` and `k`.
