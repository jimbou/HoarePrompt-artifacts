Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly handles the three possible cases:

1.  If `n` equals `k`, it prints 'YES' followed by 1 and 1, which is a valid solution because Alice can buy `k` jewels at a price of 1 coin per jewel.

2.  If `n` is not equal to `k` and `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, it prints 'YES' followed by 2, `n - k + 1`, and 1. This is a valid solution because Alice can buy `k - 1` jewels at a price of `n - k + 1` coins per jewel, and then buy 1 jewel at a price of 1 coin per jewel.

3.  If `n` is not equal to `k` and `n + 2` is not greater than `k * 2`, it prints 'NO', which is correct because it is impossible for Bob to set up the store in such a way that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

Correctness: **True**
