Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 999, `_` is 2, `n` and `k` are the values from the first line of stdin, stdin contains `t-5` lines, each containing two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n, k <= 10^18)**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged. The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the values from the first line of stdin. The stdin now contains `t-5` lines, each containing two positive integers `n` and `k`, as the first line has been read and processed.
