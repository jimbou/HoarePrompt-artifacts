Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly handles the three possible cases:

1. When `n` equals `k`, it prints 'YES' followed by the number 1, which is a valid solution because Alice can buy `k` jewels at a price of 1 coin each.

2. When `n` does not equal `k` but `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, it prints 'YES' followed by the number 2, the difference between `n` and `k` plus 1, and finally the number 1. This is a valid solution because Alice can buy `k - 1` jewels at a price of `n - k + 1` coins each, and then buy 1 jewel at a price of 1 coin.

3. When neither of the above conditions is true, it prints 'NO', which is correct because it is impossible to satisfy the condition in this case.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct output for each case.

Correctness: **True**
