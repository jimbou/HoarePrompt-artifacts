Output: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 999, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are positive integers (1 <= n, k <= 10^18), stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n, k <= 10^18). `n` is not equal to `k`. The current value of `n` is greater than `k * 2 - 2`, 'YES' is printed, and the number 2 is being printed, and the difference between `n` and `k` plus 1 is being printed, and 1 is printed**
