Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 999, `_` is 1, `n` and `k` are positive integers (1 <= n, k <= 10^18), `n` and `k` are the values from the first line of stdin, stdin contains `t-3` lines, each containing two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n, k <= 10^18). If `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, 'YES' is printed, followed by the number 2, the difference between `n` and `k` plus 1, and finally 1. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
