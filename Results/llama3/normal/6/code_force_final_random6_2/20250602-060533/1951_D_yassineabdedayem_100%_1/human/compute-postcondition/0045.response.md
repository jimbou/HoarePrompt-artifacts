To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 1 and `t` is an integer between 2 and 999. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 999, `_` is 2, `n` and `k` are positive integers (1 <= n, k <= 10^18), `n` and `k` are the values from the first line of stdin, stdin contains `t-4` lines, each containing two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n, k <= 10^18). If `n` equals `k`, 'YES' is printed, followed by the number 1, and 1 is printed. If `n` is not equal to `k`, then if `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, 'YES' is printed, followed by the number 2, the difference between `n` and `k` plus 1, and finally 1. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**
