Output: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 999, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are positive integers (1 <= n, k <= 10^18), stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n, k <= 10^18). `n` is not equal to `k`, and `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`, and 'NO' is being printed**
