Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when n = 7 and k = 3, the program prints "YES" and the prices 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11, but this is not a valid solution because Alice will not buy exactly 3 jewels with these prices. 

A correct solution for this case would be to print "YES" and the prices 2 3, because Alice will buy 3 jewels at the first stall and then not have enough money to buy any jewels at the second stall.

The program also does not work correctly for cases where n is not equal to k and n + 2 is not greater than k * 2. In these cases, the program prints "NO", but it is possible to find a solution. For example, when n = 10 and k = 3, the program prints "NO", but a correct solution would be to print "YES" and the prices 3 3 1, because Alice will buy 3 jewels at the first stall, 0 jewels at the second stall, and 0 jewels at the third stall.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
