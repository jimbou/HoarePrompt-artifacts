The code prints the value of `n - k + 1`, where `n` is a positive integer greater than `k * 2 - 2`, and `k` is a positive integer.

Since `n` is greater than `k * 2 - 2`, we can deduce that `n - k + 1` will be a positive integer greater than or equal to 3.

Output: **a positive integer greater than or equal to 3 (which is the value of n - k + 1)**
