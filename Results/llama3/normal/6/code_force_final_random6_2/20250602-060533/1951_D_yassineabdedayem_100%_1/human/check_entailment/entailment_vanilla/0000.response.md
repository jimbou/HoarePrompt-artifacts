Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Bob can set up his store to ensure Alice buys exactly k jewels. The program takes two inputs, n and k, representing the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy, respectively.

The program first checks if n is equal to k. If this is the case, it prints "YES" and sets up a single stall with a price of 1, ensuring Alice buys exactly k jewels.

If n is not equal to k, the program checks if n + 2 is greater than k * 2. If this condition is met, it prints "YES" and sets up two stalls. The first stall has a price of n - k + 1, and the second stall has a price of 1. This setup ensures that Alice buys exactly k jewels.

However, if the condition n + 2 > k * 2 is not met, the program prints "NO", indicating that it is impossible for Bob to set up his store to ensure Alice buys exactly k jewels.

The program's logic is based on the fact that Alice buys greedily and will go to each stall in order, buying as many jewels as possible. By setting up the stalls with specific prices, Bob can control the number of jewels Alice buys.

The program's use of the condition n + 2 > k * 2 is crucial in determining whether it is possible to set up the store. This condition ensures that there are enough coins for Alice to buy at least one jewel from the first stall and still have enough coins to buy the remaining jewels from the second stall.

Overall, the program's logic is sound, and it correctly determines whether Bob can set up his store to ensure Alice buys exactly k jewels.

Correctness: **True**
