The code prints the difference between `n` and `k` plus 1, where `n` and `k` are the values from the first line of stdin. Since `n` and `k` are positive integers between 1 and 10^18, the output will be a positive integer.

Output: **n - k + 1 (where n and k are the values from the first line of stdin)**
