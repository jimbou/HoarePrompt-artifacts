Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains `t` lines, each containing two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n, k <= 10^18)
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
    if n == k:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(1)
    elif n + 2 > k * 2:
        print('YES')
        print(2)
        print(n - k + 1, end=' ')
        print(1)
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 999, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are positive integers (1 <= n, k <= 10^18), stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n, k <= 10^18). If `n` equals `k`, 'YES' is printed, and the number 1 is printed. If `n` is not equal to `k`, then if `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, the difference between `n` and `k` plus 1 is printed, and 1 is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 999, `_` is 1, `n` and `k` are positive integers (1 <= n, k <= 10^18), `n` and `k` are the values from the first line of stdin, stdin contains `t-3` lines, each containing two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n, k <= 10^18). If `n` equals `k`, 'YES' is printed, followed by the number 1, and 1 is printed. If `n` is not equal to `k`, then if `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, 'YES' is printed, followed by the number 2, the difference between `n` and `k` plus 1, and finally 1. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 999, `_` is 2, `n` and `k` are the values from the first line of stdin, stdin contains `t-5` lines, each containing two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n, k <= 10^18). If `n` equals `k`, 'YES' is printed, followed by the number 1 printed twice. If `n` is not equal to `k`, then if `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, 'YES' is printed, followed by the number 2, the difference between `n` and `k` plus 1, and finally the number 1. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
