Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether three digits form a stair, a peak, or neither. It checks for the conditions a<b<c for a stair and a<b>c for a peak, and outputs the corresponding result. The program also handles the case where the digits do not form a stair or a peak, outputting "NONE" in such cases.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including when the digits are equal, when they are in decreasing order, and when they are in increasing order but do not form a stair or a peak. The program's logic is sound and it produces the correct output for all possible inputs.
