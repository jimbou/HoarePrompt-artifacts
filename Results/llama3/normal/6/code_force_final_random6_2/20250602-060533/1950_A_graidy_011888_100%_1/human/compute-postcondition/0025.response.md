State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers assigned from the input, stdin contains no input. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, then 'STAIR' is printed. If `a` is less than `b` but `b` is greater than `c`, then 'PEAK' is printed. Otherwise, 'NONE' is printed.**
