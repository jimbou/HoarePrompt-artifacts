Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers, 'STAIR' or 'PEAK' or 'NONE' is printed**.

In this output state, the values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are reassigned from the input. Since stdin contains no input initially, it now contains a space-separated list of integers. The print statement is executed based on the conditions, and either 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' is printed.
