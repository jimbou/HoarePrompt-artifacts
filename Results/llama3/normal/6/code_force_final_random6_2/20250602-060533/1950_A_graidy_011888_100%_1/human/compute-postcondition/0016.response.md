Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers assigned from the input, stdin contains no input. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, then 'STAIR' is printed. If `a` is less than `b` but `b` is greater than `c`, then 'PEAK' is printed. Otherwise, 'NONE' is printed.**

In this output state, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to the integers assigned from the input. The other variables, `n` and `i`, remain unchanged. The stdin is empty, as the input has been consumed. The printing conditions for 'STAIR', 'PEAK', and 'NONE' are still valid, but their evaluation depends on the actual values of `a`, `b`, and `c` assigned from the input.
