Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers, stdin contains no input**.

In this output state, the values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned integer values from the input, which is a space-separated list of integers. Since the input is consumed, the stdin is now empty.
