Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n`, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers assigned from the input, stdin contains no input. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, then 'STAIR' is printed. If `a` is less than `b` but `b` is greater than `c`, then 'PEAK' is printed. Otherwise, 'NONE' is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `n` will be the same as the initial value, `i` will be equal to `n`, and `a`, `b`, and `c` will be the last set of integers read from the input. The input stream will be empty, and the output will depend on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` according to the conditions in the loop body.
