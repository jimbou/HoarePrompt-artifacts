The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than `len(nums) - 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `len(nums)` is at least 4. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `len(nums)` must be at least 4.
State: **N is an integer between 1 and 10^4, nums is a sorted list of unique integers between 1 and 10^9 with a prepended 0 that must have at least 4 elements, stdin is empty, i is 2**
