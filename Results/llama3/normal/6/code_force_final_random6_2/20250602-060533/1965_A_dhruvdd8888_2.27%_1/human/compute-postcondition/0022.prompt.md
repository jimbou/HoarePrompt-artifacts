Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: N is an integer between 1 and 10^4, nums is a sorted list of unique integers between 1 and 10^9 with a prepended 0, cd is 0, stdin is empty. The length of nums is more than 2
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(nums) - 2):
    if nums[i + 1] - nums[i] == 1:
        cd += 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: N is an integer between 1 and 10^4, nums is a sorted list of unique integers between 1 and 10^9 with a prepended 0 that must have at least 3 elements, stdin is empty, i is 0. If the difference between the (i+1)th element and the ith element of nums is 1, then cd is 1. Otherwise, cd is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: N is an integer between 1 and 10^4, nums is a sorted list of unique integers between 1 and 10^9 with a prepended 0 that must have at least 4 elements, stdin is empty, i is 1. If the difference between the elements at index i+1 and i in nums is 1, then cd is increased by 1. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *N is an integer between 1 and 10^4, nums is a sorted list of unique integers between 1 and 10^9 with a prepended 0 that must have at least 4 elements, stdin is empty. If the difference between the third and second elements in nums is 1, then cd is increased by 1 and i remains 2. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
