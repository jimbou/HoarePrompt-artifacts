Output State: **N is an integer between 1 and 10^4, nums is a sorted list of unique integers between 1 and 10^9 with a prepended 0 that must have at least 3 elements, cd is 0, stdin is empty, i is 0, and the difference between the (i+1)th and ith elements of nums is not equal to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all the variables maintain their initial values and properties, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
