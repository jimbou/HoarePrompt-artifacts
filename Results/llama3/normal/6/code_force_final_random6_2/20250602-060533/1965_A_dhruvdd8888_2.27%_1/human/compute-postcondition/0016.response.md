Output State: **N is an integer between 1 and 10^4, nums is a sorted list of unique integers between 1 and 10^9 with a prepended 0 that must have at least 4 elements, stdin is empty, i is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of N, nums, stdin, and i remain unchanged. However, we exit the innermost loop or if statement due to the break statement.
