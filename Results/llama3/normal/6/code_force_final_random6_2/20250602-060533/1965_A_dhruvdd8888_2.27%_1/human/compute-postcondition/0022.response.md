Output State: **N is an integer between 1 and 10^4, nums is a sorted list of unique integers between 1 and 10^9 with a prepended 0, stdin is empty, i is len(nums) - 2, and cd is the number of consecutive pairs of elements in nums that have a difference of 1, starting from the first element.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the variable `i` will be equal to the second last index of the list `nums`, and the variable `cd` will be equal to the number of consecutive pairs of elements in `nums` that have a difference of 1, starting from the first element. The other variables `N`, `nums`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
