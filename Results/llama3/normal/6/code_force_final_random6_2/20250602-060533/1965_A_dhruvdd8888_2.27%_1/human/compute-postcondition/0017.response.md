Postcondition: **N is an integer between 1 and 10^4, nums is a sorted list of unique integers between 1 and 10^9 with a prepended 0 that must have at least 4 elements, stdin is empty, i is 1. If the difference between the elements at index i+1 and i in nums is 1, then cd is increased by 1. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
