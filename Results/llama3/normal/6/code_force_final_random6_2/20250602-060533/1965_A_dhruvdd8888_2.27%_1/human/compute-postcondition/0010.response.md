Output State: **N is an integer between 1 and 10^4, nums is a sorted list of unique integers between 1 and 10^9 with a prepended 0 that must have at least 3 elements, cd is 1, stdin is empty, i is 0. The current value of i is such that the difference between the (i+1)th element and the ith element of nums is 1.**

In this output state, the value of cd has been incremented by 1, resulting in cd being 1. The other variables remain unchanged, with N still being an integer between 1 and 10^4, nums still being a sorted list of unique integers between 1 and 10^9 with a prepended 0 that must have at least 3 elements, stdin still being empty, and i still being 0. Additionally, the condition that the difference between the (i+1)th element and the ith element of nums is 1 remains true.
