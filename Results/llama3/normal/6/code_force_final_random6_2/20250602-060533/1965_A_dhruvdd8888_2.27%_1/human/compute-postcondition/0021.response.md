Postcondition: ***N is an integer between 1 and 10^4, nums is a sorted list of unique integers between 1 and 10^9 with a prepended 0 that must have at least 4 elements, stdin is empty. If the difference between the third and second elements in nums is 1, then cd is increased by 1 and i remains 2. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
