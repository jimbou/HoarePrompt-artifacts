Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `nums` is a sorted list of unique integers between 1 and 10^9 with a prepended 0 that must have at least 4 elements, `i` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `N`, `nums`, and `i` remain unchanged because the `break` statement only exits the current loop or if statement without modifying any variables. The stdin is still empty.
