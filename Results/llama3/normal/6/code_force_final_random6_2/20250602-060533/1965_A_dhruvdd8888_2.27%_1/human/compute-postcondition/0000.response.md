Output State: **N is an integer between 1 and 10^4, nums is a sorted list of unique integers between 1 and 10^9, stdin is empty**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

After executing the code, the variable N holds an integer value between 1 and 10^4, which represents the number of test cases. The variable nums is a sorted list of unique integers, each between 1 and 10^9. The list is sorted in ascending order, and it contains no duplicate values. The stdin (standard input) is now empty, as all the input values have been read and processed.
