Postcondition: **N is an integer between 1 and 10^4, nums is a sorted list of unique integers between 1 and 10^9 with a prepended 0 that must have at least 3 elements, cd is 0, stdin is empty, i is 0. The current value of i is such that the difference between the (i+1)th element and the ith element of nums is 1.**
