Postcondition: **N is an integer between 1 and 10^4, nums is a sorted list of unique integers between 1 and 10^9 with a prepended 0 that must have at least 3 elements, stdin is empty, i is 0. If the difference between the (i+1)th element and the ith element of nums is 1, then cd is 1. Otherwise, cd is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
