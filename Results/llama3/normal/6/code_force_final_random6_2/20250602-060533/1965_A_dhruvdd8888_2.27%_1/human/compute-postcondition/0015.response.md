Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `nums` is a sorted list of unique integers between 1 and 10^9 with a prepended 0 that must have at least 4 elements, `cd` is increased by 1, `i` is 1, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `cd` has been incremented by 1, while the values of `N`, `nums`, `i`, and stdin remain unchanged. The list `nums` still has a prepended 0 and contains at least 4 elements, and `i` is still equal to 1.
