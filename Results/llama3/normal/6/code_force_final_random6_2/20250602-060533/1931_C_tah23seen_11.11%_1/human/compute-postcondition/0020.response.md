Output State: **`i` is less than or equal to the length of `arr` minus one, and `arr` has at least two adjacent equal elements starting from index `i-1`.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, but it is still less than or equal to the length of `arr` minus one. The condition that `arr` has at least two adjacent equal elements starting from index `i` is still valid, but now it starts from index `i-1` because `i` has been incremented.
