You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of non-negative integers.
    i = 0
    j = len(arr) - 1
    while i <= j:
        if arr[i] == arr[j]:
            i += 1
            j -= 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: i is set to the index of the first element of `arr` that is not equal to the corresponding element from the end of `arr`, and j is set to the index of the last element of `arr` that is not equal to the corresponding element from the start of `arr`. If all elements of `arr` are equal to their corresponding elements from the end of `arr`, then i is set to the length of `arr` and j is set to -1.
    if (i > j) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0.
    #State: *i is set to the index of the first element of `arr` that is not equal to the corresponding element from the end of `arr`, and j is set to the index of the last element of `arr` that is not equal to the corresponding element from the start of `arr`. If all elements of `arr` are equal to their corresponding elements from the end of `arr`, then i is set to the length of `arr` and j is set to -1. Additionally, i is less than or equal to j
    while arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
        i += 1
        
    #State: i is equal to the length of `arr` minus one, and `arr` has all equal elements.
    if (j != len(arr) - 1) :
        return j - i + 1
        #The program returns the difference between j and the length of arr minus one plus one, where j is not equal to the length of arr minus one and arr has all equal elements.
    #State: *i is equal to the length of `arr` minus one, `arr` has all equal elements, and j is equal to the length of `arr` minus one
    return j - i
    #The program returns 0, which is the difference between j and i, where j is equal to the length of `arr` minus one and i is also equal to the length of `arr` minus one.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0.

Case_2: The program returns the difference between j and the length of arr minus one plus one, where j is not equal to the length of arr minus one and arr has all equal elements.

Case_3: The program returns 0, which is the difference between j and i, where j is equal to the length of `arr` minus one and i is also equal to the length of `arr` minus one.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
