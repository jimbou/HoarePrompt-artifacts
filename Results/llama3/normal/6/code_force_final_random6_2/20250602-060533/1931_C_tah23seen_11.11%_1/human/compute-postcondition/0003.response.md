The code snippet increments the value of `i` by 1 and decrements the value of `j` by 1. Since `i` was initially 0, it becomes 1. Since `j` was the last index of `arr`, it becomes the second last index of `arr`. The value of `arr[i]` is no longer equal to the value of `arr[j]` because `i` and `j` now point to different elements in the list. The list `arr` itself remains unchanged.

Output State: **arr is a non-empty list of non-negative integers, i is 1, j is the second last index of arr**
