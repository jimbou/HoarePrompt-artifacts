Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, consider the input array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. The program will return 5, but the correct answer is 6. The program only checks if the first and last elements are equal, and if they are not, it returns the difference between the indices of the first and last elements. However, this approach does not consider the case where the array has multiple segments of equal elements.

For instance, in the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], the program will return 5 because it only checks the first and last elements (1 and 6), but it does not consider the fact that there are multiple segments of equal elements (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6). The correct approach would be to find the longest segment of equal elements and return its length.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the Correctness is **False**.
