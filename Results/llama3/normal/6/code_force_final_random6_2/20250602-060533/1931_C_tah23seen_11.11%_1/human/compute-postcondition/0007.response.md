To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `i` and `j` so that `i` is less than or equal to `j`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `j` is the second last index of `arr`. Since `i` is already 1, we cannot decrease it further. Therefore, we need to adjust `j` to be greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of non-negative integers, `i` is 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1**
