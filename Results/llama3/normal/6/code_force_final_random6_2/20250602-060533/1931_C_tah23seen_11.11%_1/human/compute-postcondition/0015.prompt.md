Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: arr is a list of non-negative integers, i is 0, j is the last index of arr
Code of the loop:
while i <= j:
    if arr[i] == arr[j]:
        i += 1
        j -= 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`arr` is a non-empty list of non-negative integers. If the first element of `arr` is equal to the last element of `arr`, then `i` is set to 1 and `j` is set to the second last index of `arr`. Otherwise, the first element of `arr` is not equal to the last element of `arr`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`arr` is a non-empty list of non-negative integers. If `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[j]`, then `i` is updated to 2 and `j` is updated to be greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, leaving `i` as 1 and `j` as greater than or equal to 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`arr` is a non-empty list of non-negative integers. If `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[j]`, then `i` is 2 and `j` is greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise, `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than or equal to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
