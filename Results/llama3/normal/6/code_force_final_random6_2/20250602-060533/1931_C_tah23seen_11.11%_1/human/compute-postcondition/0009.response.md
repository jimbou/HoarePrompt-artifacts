Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of non-negative integers, `i` is 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `arr`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The only effect of the code is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement that we were directly inside.
