Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by checking if the array is already sorted in a specific way, but it does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of burles needed to make all elements equal.

The function `func_1` starts by checking if the array is already sorted in a specific way by comparing elements from the start and end of the array. If the array is already sorted, it returns 0. However, this approach is not correct because it does not consider all possible cases.

The function then tries to find the first pair of adjacent elements that are not equal, but it does not correctly handle the case where the array has only one element or where the first and last elements are equal.

Moreover, the function does not correctly calculate the minimum number of burles needed to make all elements equal. It simply returns the difference between the indices of the first pair of adjacent elements that are not equal, which is not the correct solution.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
