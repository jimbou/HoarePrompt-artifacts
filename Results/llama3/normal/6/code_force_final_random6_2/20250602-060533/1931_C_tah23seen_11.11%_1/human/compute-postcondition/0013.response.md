Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of non-negative integers. `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than or equal to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the value of `arr` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The values of `i` and `j` are updated according to the initial state condition, where `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than or equal to 1. Additionally, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement due to the `break` statement.
