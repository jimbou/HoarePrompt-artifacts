Postcondition: ***`arr` is a non-empty list of non-negative integers. If the first element of `arr` is equal to the last element of `arr`, then `i` is set to 1 and `j` is set to the second last index of `arr`. Otherwise, the first element of `arr` is not equal to the last element of `arr`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
