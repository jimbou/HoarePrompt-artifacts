#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines the length of the longest substring of a given list of non-negative integers that is a palindrome. If the entire list is a palindrome, it returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the length of the longest palindromic substring. If the list has all equal elements, it returns the length of the list minus one if the last element is not equal to the first element, or 0 if the last element is equal to the first element.
