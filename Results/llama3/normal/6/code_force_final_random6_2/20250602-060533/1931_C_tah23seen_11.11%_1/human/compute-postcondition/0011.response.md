According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `i` is less than or equal to `j`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than or equal to 1. `j` being greater than or equal to 1 does ensure that the loop will execute again, so it does not need to be adjusted. `i` is 1, so it does not need to be adjusted either. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of non-negative integers. If `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[j]`, then `i` is 2 and `j` is greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, leaving `i` as 1 and `j` as greater than or equal to 1.**
