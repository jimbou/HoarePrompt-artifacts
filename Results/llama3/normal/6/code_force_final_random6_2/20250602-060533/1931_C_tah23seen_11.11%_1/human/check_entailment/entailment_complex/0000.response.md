Reasoning:

The given Python program is supposed to determine the minimum number of "burles" (operations) needed to make all elements of an array equal. However, the provided function `func_1` does not seem to be doing that. Instead, it appears to be finding the length of the longest palindromic substring in the array.

The function first checks if the array is a palindrome by comparing elements from the start and end of the array. If it is a palindrome, it returns 0. If not, it tries to find the longest palindromic substring by checking if the first element is equal to the second element, and so on.

However, this approach does not solve the original problem of finding the minimum number of operations to make all elements of the array equal. The correct approach would be to find the most frequent element in the array and then calculate the number of operations needed to replace all other elements with that most frequent element.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect for the problem described.

Correctness: **False**
