Output State: **i is set to the index of the first element of `arr` that is not equal to the corresponding element from the end of `arr`, and j is set to the index of the last element of `arr` that is not equal to the corresponding element from the start of `arr`. If all elements of `arr` are equal to their corresponding elements from the end of `arr`, then i is set to the length of `arr` and j is set to -1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop will continue to increment `i` and decrement `j` as long as the elements at the current indices `i` and `j` are equal. If it finds a pair of elements that are not equal, it will break out of the loop, leaving `i` and `j` at the indices of the first pair of elements that are not equal. If all elements of `arr` are equal to their corresponding elements from the end of `arr`, then the loop will continue until `i` is equal to the length of `arr` and `j` is equal to -1.
