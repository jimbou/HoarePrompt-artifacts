Output State: **`i` is less than or equal to the length of `arr` minus one, and `arr` has at least three adjacent equal elements starting from index `i-1`.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1. Since `i` was initially less than or equal to the length of `arr` minus one, it remains so after the increment. Additionally, since `arr` had at least four adjacent equal elements starting from index `i-2`, it now has at least three adjacent equal elements starting from index `i-1`.
