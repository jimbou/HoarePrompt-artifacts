To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `i <= j`.

Given that `i` is 0 and `j` is the last index of `arr`, we can see that `i` is already less than or equal to `j` because the last index of a list is always greater than or equal to 0 (assuming the list is not empty).

However, to guarantee that the loop can execute at least once, we need to ensure that `arr` is not empty. If `arr` is empty, `j` would be -1 (since the last index of an empty list is -1), and the condition `i <= j` would not be met.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `arr` is not empty.

State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of non-negative integers, `i` is 0, `j` is the last index of `arr`**
