Postcondition: ***`arr` is a non-empty list of non-negative integers. If `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[j]`, then `i` is updated to 2 and `j` is updated to be greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, leaving `i` as 1 and `j` as greater than or equal to 1.***
