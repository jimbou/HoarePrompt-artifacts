The variable in the loop head is `arr` and `i`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `arr` and `i`. If `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than or equal to the length of `arr` minus one, and `arr` has at least two adjacent equal elements starting from index `i-1`. `i` being less than or equal to the length of `arr` minus one does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is less than the length of `arr` minus one. Also, `arr` having at least two adjacent equal elements starting from index `i-1` does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `arr` has at least three adjacent equal elements starting from index `i-1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`i` is less than the length of `arr` minus one, and `arr` has at least three adjacent equal elements starting from index `i-1`.**
