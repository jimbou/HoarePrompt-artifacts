Postcondition: ***i is set to the index of the first element of `arr` that is not equal to the corresponding element from the end of `arr`, and j is set to the index of the last element of `arr` that is not equal to the corresponding element from the start of `arr`. If all elements of `arr` are equal to their corresponding elements from the end of `arr`, then the current value of i is the length of `arr` and the current value of j is -1. Additionally, the current value of i is greater than the current value of j.***
