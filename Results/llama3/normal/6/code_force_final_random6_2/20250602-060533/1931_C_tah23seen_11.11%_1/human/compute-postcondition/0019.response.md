To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`. This condition depends on the state of `i` and the elements of `arr`.

Given that `i` is set to the index of the first element of `arr` that is not equal to the corresponding element from the end of `arr`, and `j` is set to the index of the last element of `arr` that is not equal to the corresponding element from the start of `arr`, with the additional condition that `i` is less than or equal to `j`, we can infer the following:

1. If all elements of `arr` are equal to their corresponding elements from the end of `arr`, then `i` is set to the length of `arr` and `j` is set to -1. In this case, `i` is out of bounds for the array, and the condition `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]` cannot be evaluated because `i` is not a valid index for `arr`. Therefore, this scenario does not allow the loop to execute.

2. If not all elements of `arr` are equal to their corresponding elements from the end of `arr`, then `i` and `j` are set to indices within the bounds of `arr`, with `i` being the first index from the start where the element does not match the corresponding element from the end, and `j` being the last index from the start where the element does not match the corresponding element from the end.

For the loop to execute at least once, we need `arr[i]` to be equal to `arr[i + 1]`. Given that `i` is the index of the first element that does not match the corresponding element from the end, it implies that the elements before `i` (if any) and the elements at and after `i` could be equal to their corresponding elements from the end, but the specific condition for the loop to run is that `arr[i]` and `arr[i + 1]` are equal.

Since `i` is less than or equal to `j`, and considering the loop condition `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that there are at least two elements in `arr` that are equal and adjacent, starting from the index `i`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time is that `arr` must have at least two adjacent equal elements starting from index `i`, and `i` must be less than the length of `arr` minus one to ensure `i + 1` is a valid index.

State: **`i` is less than the length of `arr` minus one, and `arr` has at least two adjacent equal elements starting from index `i`.**
