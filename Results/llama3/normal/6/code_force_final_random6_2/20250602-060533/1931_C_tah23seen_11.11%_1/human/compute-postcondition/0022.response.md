Output State: **`i` is less than or equal to the length of `arr` minus one, and `arr` has at least three adjacent equal elements starting from index `i-2`.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now one position ahead of its initial value. The condition that `arr` has at least three adjacent equal elements starting from index `i-1` is still valid, but since `i` has moved one position ahead, the starting index of these adjacent equal elements is now `i-2`.
