Reasoning:
The given program is designed to solve a problem where the goal is to find the minimum number of "burles" (a measure of the cost of an operation) needed to make all elements of an array equal by applying an operation that sets all elements within a specified range to a single value. The operation can only be applied once.

However, upon examining the provided program, it appears to be solving a different problem. The function `func_1` seems to be checking if the input array is a palindrome and returns the length of the longest palindromic substring if it's not a full palindrome. This does not align with the problem description provided.

The execution summary also describes the function's behavior as determining the length of the longest substring of a given list of non-negative integers that is a palindrome, which further confirms that the program is not solving the intended problem.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and the execution summary, the given program is incorrect for the specified problem.

Correctness: **False**
