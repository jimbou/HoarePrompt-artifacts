The only variable in the loop head is variable arr, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable arr.  If arr[i] is equal to arr[i + 1], the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, arr has at least three adjacent equal elements starting from index `i-2`, So for the loop to be executed one more time arr must have at least four adjacent equal elements starting from index `i-2`.
State: **`i` is less than or equal to the length of `arr` minus one, and `arr` has at least four adjacent equal elements starting from index `i-2`.**
