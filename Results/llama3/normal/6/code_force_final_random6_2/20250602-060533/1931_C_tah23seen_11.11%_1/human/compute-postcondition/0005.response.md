Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of non-negative integers, `i` is 0, `j` is the last index of `arr`, the first element of `arr` is not equal to the last element of `arr`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `arr`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged, as the `break` statement only exits the innermost loop or if statement, without modifying any variables. The condition that the first element of `arr` is not equal to the last element of `arr` is still valid, as it is not affected by the `break` statement.
