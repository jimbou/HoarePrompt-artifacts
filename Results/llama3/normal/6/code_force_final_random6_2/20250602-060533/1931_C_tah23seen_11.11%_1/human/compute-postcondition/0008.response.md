Output State: **arr is a non-empty list of non-negative integers, i is 2, j is greater than or equal to 0**

The code snippet increments the value of `i` by 1 and decrements the value of `j` by 1. Since `i` was initially 1, it becomes 2. The value of `j` was greater than or equal to 1, so after decrementing, it becomes greater than or equal to 0. The list `arr` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
