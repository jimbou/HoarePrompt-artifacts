To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `s` and the file object `open(0)`. The loop will execute if the file object has at least two lines (since we're slicing from index 1).

State: **stdin contains multiple test cases, `s` is the second line of stdin, `open(0)` is a file object that must have at least 2 lines**
