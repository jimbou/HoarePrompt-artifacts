Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers that are the first and second numbers in the third line of the file object `open(0)`, `s` is the third line of stdin, `open(0)` is a file object that must have at least 3 lines, stdin contains multiple test cases**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` are updated to be the first and second numbers in the third line of the file object `open(0)`, respectively. The value of `s` remains the same, which is the third line of stdin. The file object `open(0)` still has at least 3 lines, and stdin still contains multiple test cases.
