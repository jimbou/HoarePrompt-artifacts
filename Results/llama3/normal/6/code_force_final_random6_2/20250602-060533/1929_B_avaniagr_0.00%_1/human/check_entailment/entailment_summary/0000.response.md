Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of cells that need to be colored in a square grid of size n x n, such that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell.

The program uses a single function, `func`, which reads multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of two integers, n and k, which represent the size of the square grid and the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell, respectively.

The program then calculates the minimum number of cells that need to be colored using the expression `(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2)`. This expression is based on the fact that the minimum number of cells that need to be colored is equal to the number of diagonals that need to be colored, which is at most k.

The program then prints the calculated minimum number of cells that need to be colored for each test case.

Based on the provided execution summary, the program correctly processes all test cases and outputs the calculated minimum number of cells that need to be colored.

Correctness: **True**
