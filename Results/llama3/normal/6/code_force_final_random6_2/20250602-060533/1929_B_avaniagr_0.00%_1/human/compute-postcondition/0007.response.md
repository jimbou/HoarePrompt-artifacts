Output: **`n` and `k` are integers that are the first and second numbers in the third line of the file object `open(0)`, `s` is the third line of stdin, `open(0)` is a file object that must have at least 3 lines, stdin contains multiple test cases, and this is printed: the value of the expression `(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2)` which is an integer value based on the values of `n` and `k`**
