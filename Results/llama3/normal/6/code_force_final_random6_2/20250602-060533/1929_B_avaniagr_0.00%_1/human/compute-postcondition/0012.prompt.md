Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^8, 1 <= k <= 4n - 2).
Code of the loop:
for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
    n, k = map(int, s.split())
    print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (
        k == 4 * n - 2))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` and `k` are integers, `s` is the second line of stdin, `open(0)` is a file object that must have at least 2 lines, stdin contains multiple test cases, and this is printed: the value of the expression `(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2)` which is a mathematical expression involving the values of `k` and `n`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` and `k` are integers that are the first and second numbers in the third line of the file object `open(0)`, `s` is the third line of stdin, `open(0)` is a file object that must have at least 3 lines, stdin contains multiple test cases, and this is printed: the value of the expression `(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2)` which is an integer value based on the values of `n` and `k`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` and `k` are integers that are the first and second numbers in the fourth line of the file object `open(0)`, `s` is the fourth line of stdin, `open(0)` is a file object that must have at least 4 lines, stdin contains multiple test cases, and the value of the expression `(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2)` which is an integer value based on the values of `n` and `k` is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
