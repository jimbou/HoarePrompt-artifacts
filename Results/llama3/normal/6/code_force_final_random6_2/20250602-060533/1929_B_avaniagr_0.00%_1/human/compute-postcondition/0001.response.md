Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers, `s` is the second line of stdin, `open(0)` is a file object that must have at least 2 lines, stdin contains multiple test cases**

In this output state, `n` and `k` are assigned the values of the two integers from the second line of stdin, which is stored in the variable `s`. The values of `s` and `open(0)` remain unchanged, and stdin still contains multiple test cases.
