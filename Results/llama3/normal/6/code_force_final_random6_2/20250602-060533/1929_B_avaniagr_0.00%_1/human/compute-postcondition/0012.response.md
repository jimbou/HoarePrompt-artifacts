Output State: **The loop has executed for all test cases in stdin, and the output state is the sum of the values of the expression `(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2)` for each test case.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has processed all the test cases in the standard input (stdin), and the output is the sum of the calculated values for each test case. The calculated value for each test case is determined by the expression `(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2)`, which depends on the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.
