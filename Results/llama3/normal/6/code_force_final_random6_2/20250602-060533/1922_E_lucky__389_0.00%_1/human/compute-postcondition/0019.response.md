Output State: **`stdin` contains 1 input: an integer (t-1), `x` is an integer greater than 1, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, `i` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged: `stdin` still contains 1 input, `x` is still an integer greater than 1, `subseq_lens` is still an empty list, and `mx` is still 0.
