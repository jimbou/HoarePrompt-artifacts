Output State: **stdin contains 1 input: an integer (t-1), x is an integer equal to 0, subseq_lens is a list containing at least 2 integers, mx is equal to the maximum of its original value and the first integer in subseq_lens, ansv is a list of integers from 0 to mx-1 and the second integer in subseq_lens, i is 1**

In this output state, the value of `ansv` has been updated to include the second integer in `subseq_lens`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains one input, an integer (t-1). The value of `x` is still 0, and `mx` is still equal to the maximum of its original value and the first integer in `subseq_lens`. The value of `i` is still 1.
