Output State: **`stdin` contains 1 input: an integer (t-1), `x` is an integer greater than 0, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the integer i, `mx` is equal to the maximum of its original value and i, `i` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been updated to 0, while the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains one input: an integer (t-1). The value of `x` is still an integer greater than 0. The list `subseq_lens` still contains the integer `i`, and `mx` is still equal to the maximum of its original value and `i`.
