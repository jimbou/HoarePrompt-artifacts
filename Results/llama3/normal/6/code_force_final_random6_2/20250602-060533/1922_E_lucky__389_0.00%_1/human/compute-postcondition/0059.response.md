Based on the precondition, we can determine the values of the variables and objects involved in the print statement.

* `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx-1`, where `mx` is the maximum of its original value and the `(t-1)`th integer in `subseq_lens`. Since `subseq_lens` contains integers from 1 to `t`, the `(t-1)`th integer is `t-1`. Therefore, `mx` is equal to `t-1`.
* `ansv` also includes the integers from the second to the `(t-1)`th in `subseq_lens`, which are from 2 to `t-1`. Since `t-1` is the maximum value in `subseq_lens`, `ansv` contains all integers from 0 to `t-1`.
* `i` is equal to 1.

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print(ansv[i], end=' ')`

Since `i` is 1, `ansv[i]` refers to the second element of `ansv`, which is 1 (since `ansv` contains integers from 0 to `t-1`).

Therefore, the print statement will output the value 1, followed by a space (due to the `end=' '` argument).

Output: **1**
