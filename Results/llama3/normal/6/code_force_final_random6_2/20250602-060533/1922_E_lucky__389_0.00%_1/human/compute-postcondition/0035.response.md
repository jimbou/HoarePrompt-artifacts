The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now 2. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `stdin` contains 1 input: an integer (t-1), `x` must be at least 3, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the integer 1, `mx` is equal to the maximum of its original value and 1, and `i` is 2.
