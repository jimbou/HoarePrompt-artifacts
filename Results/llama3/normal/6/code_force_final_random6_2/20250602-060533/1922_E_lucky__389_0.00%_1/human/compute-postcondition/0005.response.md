The variable in the loop head is variable x and i. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable x and i.  If 2 ** (i + 1) is less than or equal to x + 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, x is an integer greater than 0 and i is 1. For the loop to be executed one more time, x needs to be greater than or equal to 3 and i needs to be 1.
State: **`stdin` contains 1 input: an integer (t-1), `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, `i` is 1**
