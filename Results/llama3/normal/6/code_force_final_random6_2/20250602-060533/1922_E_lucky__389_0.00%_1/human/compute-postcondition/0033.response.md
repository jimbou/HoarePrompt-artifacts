Output State: **`stdin` contains 1 input: an integer (t-1), `x` must be at least 1, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the integer `i`, `mx` is equal to the maximum of its original value and `i`, `i` is 1**

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains 1 input: an integer (t-1). The list `subseq_lens` still contains the integer `i`, which is now 1. The value of `mx` is still the maximum of its original value and `i`, but since `i` is now 1, `mx` is still the maximum of its original value and 1. The value of `x` is still at least 1.
