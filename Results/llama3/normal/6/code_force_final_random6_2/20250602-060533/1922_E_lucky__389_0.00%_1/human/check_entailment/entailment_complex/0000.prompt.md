Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

# Annotated Program:

MOD = 1000000007

    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (t) representing the number of test cases, and then t integers (X) each representing the number of increasing subsequences. 1 <= t <= 1000 and 2 <= X <= 10^18.
    x = int(input())
    x -= 1
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        
        while 2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1:
            i += 1
        
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i)
            x -= 2 ** i - 1
            mx = max(mx, i)
        
    #State: stdin contains 1 input: an integer (t-1), x is an integer equal to 0, subseq_lens is a list containing the integers i, mx is equal to the maximum of its original value and i.
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
        
    #State: stdin contains 1 input: an integer (t-1), x is an integer equal to 0, subseq_lens is a list containing integers from 1 to t, mx is equal to the maximum of its original value and the (t-1)th integer in subseq_lens, ansv is a list of integers from 0 to mx-1 and the integers from the second to the (t-1)th in subseq_lens, i is t-1
    print(len(ansv))
    #This is printed: 2t - 4
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
        
    #State: stdin contains 1 input: an integer (t-1), x is an integer equal to 0, subseq_lens is a list containing integers from 1 to t, mx is equal to the maximum of its original value and the (t-1)th integer in subseq_lens, ansv is a list of integers from 0 to mx-1 and the integers from the second to the (t-1)th in subseq_lens, i is mx + t - 3, and the (mx + t - 2)th element of ansv which is the (t-1)th integer in subseq_lens is being printed
    print()
    #This is printed: The (t-1)th integer in subseq_lens (which is the (mx + t - 2)th element of ansv)

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads an integer (t) from standard input, representing the number of test cases, and then reads t integers (X) representing the number of increasing subsequences. It calculates the length of the longest increasing subsequence for each X and prints the total number of subsequences (2t - 4) followed by the lengths of the subsequences, including the longest increasing subsequence for each X. The function modifies the input variables, leaving the standard input with one remaining integer (t-1), and produces output in the form of the total number of subsequences and their lengths.
