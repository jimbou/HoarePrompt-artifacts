This function reads an integer (t) from standard input, representing the number of test cases, and then reads t integers (X) representing the number of increasing subsequences. It calculates the length of the longest increasing subsequence for each X and prints the total number of subsequences (2t - 4) followed by the lengths of the subsequences, including the longest increasing subsequence for each X. The function modifies the input variables, leaving the standard input with one remaining integer (t-1), and produces output in the form of the total number of subsequences and their lengths.
