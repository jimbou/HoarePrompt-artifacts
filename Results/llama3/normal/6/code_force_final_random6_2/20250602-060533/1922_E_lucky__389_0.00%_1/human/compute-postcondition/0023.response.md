Output State: **`stdin` contains 1 input: an integer (t-1), `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 3 and 2 to the power of `i + 1` is less than or equal to `x + 1`, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, `i` is 3**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, from 2 to 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition `2 to the power of `i + 1` is less than or equal to `x + 1` is still valid, as the value of `i` has only increased by 1. The stdin still contains 1 input: an integer (t-1). The list `subseq_lens` is still empty, and `mx` is still 0.
