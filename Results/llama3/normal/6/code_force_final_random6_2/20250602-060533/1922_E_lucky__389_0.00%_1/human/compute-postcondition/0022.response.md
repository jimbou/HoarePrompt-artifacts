The variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If 2 to the power of `i + 1` is less than or equal to `x + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 3. `i` being 2 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 2 and `x` is greater than or equal to 3 and 2 to the power of `i + 1` is less than or equal to `x + 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`stdin` contains 1 input: an integer (t-1), `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 3 and 2 to the power of `i + 1` is less than or equal to `x + 1`, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, `i` is 2**
