The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `2 ** (i + 1)` is less than or equal to `x + 1`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is 0, `x` is an integer greater than 0. `i` being 0 and `x` being an integer greater than 0 ensures that the loop will execute, so no other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`stdin` contains 1 input: an integer (t-1), `x` is an integer greater than 0, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, `i` is 0**
