Output State: **stdin contains 1 input: an integer (t-1), x is an integer equal to 0, subseq_lens is a list containing the integers i, mx is equal to the maximum of its original value and i, ansv is a list of integers from 0 to mx-1.**

In this output state, the values of stdin, x, subseq_lens, and mx remain unchanged from the initial state. The only change is the introduction of a new variable ansv, which is a list of integers from 0 to mx-1, where mx is the maximum of its original value and i.
