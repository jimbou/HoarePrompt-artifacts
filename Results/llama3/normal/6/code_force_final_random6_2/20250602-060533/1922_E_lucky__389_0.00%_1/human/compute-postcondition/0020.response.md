According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If 2 to the power of (i+1) is less than or equal to x+1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `x` is an integer greater than 1. `x` being greater than 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `x` is greater than or equal to 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`stdin` contains 1 input: an integer (t-1), `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, `i` is 1**
