The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is 1, so the new value of `i` is 2. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `stdin` contains 1 input: an integer (t-1), `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, `i` is 2.

Output State: **`stdin` contains 1 input: an integer (t-1), `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, `i` is 2**
