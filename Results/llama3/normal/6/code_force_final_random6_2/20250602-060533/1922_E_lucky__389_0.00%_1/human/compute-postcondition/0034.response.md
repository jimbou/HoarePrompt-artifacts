The variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If 2 to the power of `i + 1` is less than or equal to `x + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `x` must be at least 1. `x` being at least 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `x` being at least 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`stdin` contains 1 input: an integer (t-1), `x` must be at least 3, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the integer `i`, `mx` is equal to the maximum of its original value and `i`, `i` is 1**
