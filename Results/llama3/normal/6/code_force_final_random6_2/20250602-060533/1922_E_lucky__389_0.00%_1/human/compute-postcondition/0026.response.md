Output State: **`stdin` contains 1 input: an integer (t-1), `x` is an integer greater than 1, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, `i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(x + 1) - 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `x`, `subseq_lens`, `mx`, and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains one input, an integer (t-1). The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
