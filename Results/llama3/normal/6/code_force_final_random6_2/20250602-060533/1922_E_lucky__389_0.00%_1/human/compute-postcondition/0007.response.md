The variable in the loop head is `i` and `x`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If 2 to the power of `i + 1` is less than or equal to `x + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `x` is greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to be executed one more time, `x` must be greater than or equal to 5. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`stdin` contains 1 input: an integer (t-1), `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 5, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, `i` is 2**
