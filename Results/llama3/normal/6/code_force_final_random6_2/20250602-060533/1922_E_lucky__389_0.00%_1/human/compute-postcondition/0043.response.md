Postcondition: ***`stdin` contains 1 input: an integer (t-1), `x` is at least 1, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the integer `i`, `mx` is equal to the maximum of its original value and `i`. If `i` is 0, the current value of `i` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is not 0, `x` is reduced by 2^i - 1, and `subseq_lens` contains the integer `i` twice.***
