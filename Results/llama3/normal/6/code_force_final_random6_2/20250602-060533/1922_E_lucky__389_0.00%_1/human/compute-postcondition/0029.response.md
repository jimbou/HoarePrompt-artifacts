Postcondition: ***`stdin` contains 1 input: an integer (t-1), `x` is an integer greater than 1, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the integer i, `mx` is equal to the maximum of its original value and i, `i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(x + 1) - 1. If `i` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `x` is updated to its original value minus 2 to the power of i minus 1.***
