Postcondition: ***`stdin` contains 1 input: an integer (t-1), `x` is an integer greater than 0, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, `i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(x + 1) - 1. If `i` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `x` is an integer greater than 0 minus (2 to the power of `i`) plus 1.***
