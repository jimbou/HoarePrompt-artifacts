Output State: **`stdin` contains 1 input: an integer (t-1), `x` is at least 7, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the integer 1, `mx` is equal to the maximum of its original value and 1, and `i` is 3**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, from 2 to 3. The other variables remain unchanged, with `stdin` still containing one input, `x` still being at least 7, `subseq_lens` still containing the integer 1, and `mx` still being equal to the maximum of its original value and 1.
