You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (t) representing the number of test cases, and then t integers (X) each representing the number of increasing subsequences. 1 <= t <= 1000 and 2 <= X <= 10^18.
    x = int(input())
    x -= 1
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        
        while 2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1:
            i += 1
        
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i)
            x -= 2 ** i - 1
            mx = max(mx, i)
        
    #State: stdin contains 1 input: an integer (t-1), x is an integer equal to 0, subseq_lens is a list containing the integers i, mx is equal to the maximum of its original value and i.
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
        
    #State: stdin contains 1 input: an integer (t-1), x is an integer equal to 0, subseq_lens is a list containing integers from 1 to t, mx is equal to the maximum of its original value and the (t-1)th integer in subseq_lens, ansv is a list of integers from 0 to mx-1 and the integers from the second to the (t-1)th in subseq_lens, i is t-1
    print(len(ansv))
    #This is printed: 2t - 4
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
        
    #State: stdin contains 1 input: an integer (t-1), x is an integer equal to 0, subseq_lens is a list containing integers from 1 to t, mx is equal to the maximum of its original value and the (t-1)th integer in subseq_lens, ansv is a list of integers from 0 to mx-1 and the integers from the second to the (t-1)th in subseq_lens, i is mx + t - 3, and the (mx + t - 2)th element of ansv which is the (t-1)th integer in subseq_lens is being printed
    print()
    #This is printed: The (t-1)th integer in subseq_lens (which is the (mx + t - 2)th element of ansv)

```

Return Postconditions: stdin contains 1 input: an integer (t-1), x is an integer equal to 0, subseq_lens is a list containing integers from 1 to t, mx is equal to the maximum of its original value and the (t-1)th integer in subseq_lens, ansv is a list of integers from 0 to mx-1 and the integers from the second to the (t-1)th in subseq_lens, i is mx + t - 3, and the (mx + t - 2)th element of ansv which is the (t-1)th integer in subseq_lens is being printed


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
