Output State: **`stdin` contains 1 input: an integer (t-1), `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 5, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, `i` is 3**

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so it changes from 2 to 3. The other variables are not affected by the code, so their values remain the same. The stdin still contains one input: an integer (t-1).
