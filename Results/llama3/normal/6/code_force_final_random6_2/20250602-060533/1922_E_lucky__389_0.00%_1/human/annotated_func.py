#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (t) representing the number of test cases, and then t integers (X) each representing the number of increasing subsequences. 1 <= t <= 1000 and 2 <= X <= 10^18.
    x = int(input())
    x -= 1
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        
        while 2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1:
            i += 1
        
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i)
            x -= 2 ** i - 1
            mx = max(mx, i)
        
    #State: stdin contains 1 input: an integer (t-1), x is an integer equal to 0, subseq_lens is a list containing the integers i, mx is equal to the maximum of its original value and i.
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
        
    #State: stdin contains 1 input: an integer (t-1), x is an integer equal to 0, subseq_lens is a list containing integers from 1 to t, mx is equal to the maximum of its original value and the (t-1)th integer in subseq_lens, ansv is a list of integers from 0 to mx-1 and the integers from the second to the (t-1)th in subseq_lens, i is t-1
    print(len(ansv))
    #This is printed: 2t - 4
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
        
    #State: stdin contains 1 input: an integer (t-1), x is an integer equal to 0, subseq_lens is a list containing integers from 1 to t, mx is equal to the maximum of its original value and the (t-1)th integer in subseq_lens, ansv is a list of integers from 0 to mx-1 and the integers from the second to the (t-1)th in subseq_lens, i is mx + t - 3, and the (mx + t - 2)th element of ansv which is the (t-1)th integer in subseq_lens is being printed
    print()
    #This is printed: The (t-1)th integer in subseq_lens (which is the (mx + t - 2)th element of ansv)

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads an integer (t) from standard input, representing the number of test cases, and then reads t integers (X) representing the number of increasing subsequences. It calculates the length of the longest increasing subsequence for each X and prints the total number of subsequences (2t - 4) followed by the lengths of the subsequences, including the longest increasing subsequence for each X. The function modifies the input variables, leaving the standard input with one remaining integer (t-1), and produces output in the form of the total number of subsequences and their lengths.
