The first line appends the value of `i` to the list `subseq_lens`. The second line decrements the value of `x` by the value of `2 ** i - 1`. The third line updates the value of `mx` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `i`. 

Since `i` is an integer greater than 0, `2 ** i - 1` is also an integer greater than 0. Therefore, `x` becomes an integer greater than 0 minus an integer greater than 0, which is still an integer. 

Since `mx` is initially 0, and `i` is an integer greater than 0, `mx` becomes an integer greater than 0.

Output State: **x is an integer greater than 0 minus (2 ** i - 1), subseq_lens is a list containing the integer i, mx is an integer greater than 0 equal to i, stdin contains 1 input: an integer (t-1), i is an integer greater than 0**
