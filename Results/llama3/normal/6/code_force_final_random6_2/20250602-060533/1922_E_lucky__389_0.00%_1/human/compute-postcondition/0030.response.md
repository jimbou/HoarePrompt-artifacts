The only variable in the loop head is variable x, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable x.  If x is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, x is an integer greater than 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time x must be greater than 0.
State: **`stdin` contains 1 input: an integer (t-1), `x` is an integer greater than 0, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the integer i, `mx` is equal to the maximum of its original value and i, `i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(x + 1) - 1. If `i` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `x` is updated to its original value minus 2 to the power of i minus 1.**
