Output State: **a is a list of non-negative integers, n is a non-negative integer equal to the length of the list a, left is a list containing a single element 0, last is a list containing a single element -1, ans is a list of n elements all equal to -1**

In this output state, the initial values of `a` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The code introduces three new variables: `left`, `last`, and `ans`. The `left` variable is assigned a list containing a single element, 0. The `last` variable is assigned a list containing a single element, -1. The `ans` variable is assigned a list of `n` elements, all initialized to -1.
