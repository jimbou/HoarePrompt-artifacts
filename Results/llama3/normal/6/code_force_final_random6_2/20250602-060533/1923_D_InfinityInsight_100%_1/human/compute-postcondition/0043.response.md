Output State: **`a` is a list of non-negative integers, `n` is a non-negative integer equal to the length of the list `a` and must be at least 3, `left` is a list containing `n+1` elements where the first element is 0 and the rest are the cumulative sums of the elements in `a`, `last` is a list containing `n` elements, `ans` is a list of `n` elements where if `a[i]` is less than `a[i - 1]`, the element at index `i` is `i + 1 - inx` and the rest are -1, otherwise all elements are -1, `i` is 2, `x` is `left[i] - a[i] - 1`, `inx` is the result of func_1(left, x), `inx2` is last[i - 1]. If inx2 is less than inx, then inx is equal to last[i - 1]. If the current value of inx is less than 0, the loop skips to the next iteration. Otherwise, the loop continues with the current value of inx.**

In this output state, the value of `ans[i]` has been updated to `i + 1 - inx`, where `i` is 2 and `inx` is the result of func_1(left, x) or last[i - 1] depending on the conditions. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
