    #The program returns a list 'ans' of 'n' elements where if a[i] is less than a[i - 1], the element at index i is 1 and the rest are -1, otherwise all elements are -1.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of non-negative integers and its length as input, and returns a list of the same length where each element is either 1 or -1. If an element in the input list is less than its previous element, the corresponding element in the output list is 1; otherwise, it is -1. The function performs this comparison for each element in the input list, starting from the second element, and returns the resulting list.
