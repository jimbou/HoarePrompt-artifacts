Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten by another slime. The program uses two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, to calculate the minimum number of seconds. `func_1` finds the index of the smallest element in a sorted list that is greater than or equal to a given number, and `func_2` uses this function to calculate the minimum number of seconds for each slime.

The program first calculates the minimum number of seconds for each slime from left to right, and then from right to left. It then combines these two results to find the minimum number of seconds for each slime. If a slime cannot be eaten by another slime, the program sets the minimum number of seconds to -1.

The program correctly handles the case where a slime is larger than its neighbors, and it correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds for each slime. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
