Output State: **a is a list of non-negative integers, n is a non-negative integer equal to the length of the list a, left is a list containing a single element 0, last is a list containing n elements, ans is a list of n elements all equal to -1.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a state where the list `a` and the integer `n` remain unchanged, the list `left` still contains a single element 0, the list `last` contains `n` elements, and the list `ans` still contains `n` elements all equal to -1. The list `last` contains the indices of the elements in `a` that are different from the previous element, or the index of the previous different element if the current element is the same as the previous one.
