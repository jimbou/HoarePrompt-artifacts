Output State: **`a` is a list of non-negative integers, `n` is a non-negative integer equal to the length of the list `a` and must be at least 2, `left` is a list containing a single element 0, `last` is a list containing two elements 0 and 1, `ans` is a list of `n` elements all equal to -1, `i` is 1. The current value of `a[i]` is not equal to the current value of `a[i - 1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `last` has been updated to include the current value of `i`, which is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `last` now contains two elements: the initial value -1 and the current value of `i`, which is 1.
