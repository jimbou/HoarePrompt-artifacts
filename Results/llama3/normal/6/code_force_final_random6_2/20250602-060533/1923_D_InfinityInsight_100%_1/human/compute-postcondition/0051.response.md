Postcondition: ***a is a list of non-negative integers, n is a non-negative integer equal to the length of the list a and must be at least 4, left is a list containing n+1 elements where the first element is 0 and the rest are the cumulative sums of the elements in a, last is a list containing n elements, ans is a list of n elements where if a[i] is less than a[i - 1], the element at index i is 1 and the rest are -1, otherwise all elements are -1, i is 3, x is left[i] - a[i] - 1, inx is the result of func_1(left, x), inx2 is last[i - 1]. If inx2 is less than inx, then the function does not execute the if part. Otherwise, the loop or if statement we were directly inside is skipped and we move to the next iteration of the loop.***
