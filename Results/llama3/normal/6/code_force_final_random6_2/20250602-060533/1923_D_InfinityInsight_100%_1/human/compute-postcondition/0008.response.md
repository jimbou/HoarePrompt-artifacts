Output State: **`a` is a list of non-negative integers, `n` is a non-negative integer equal to the length of the list `a` and must be at least 3, `i` is 2. If the current value of `a[i]` is not equal to the current value of `a[i - 1]`, then `left` is a list containing a single element 0 and `last` is a list containing three elements 0, 1 and 2. Otherwise, `left` is a list containing a single element 0 and `last` is a list containing three elements -1, 0 and 2. `ans` is a list of `n` elements all equal to -1.**

In this output state, the value of `last` has been updated to include the current value of `i`, which is 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `left` and `last` are still dependent on the comparison between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`.
