To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for i in a:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `i` and `a`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `a` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `n` is a non-negative integer equal to the length of the list `a`, `left` is a list containing two elements 0 and `i`, `last` is a list containing n elements, `ans` is a list of n elements all equal to -1, and `i` is the first element in the list `a`.

For the loop to execute again, `a` must have at least one more element. Since `i` is the first element in the list `a`, we need to move to the next element in the list. Therefore, `i` should be the second element in the list `a`.

The state of `a` remains the same, as we are not modifying the list itself. The state of `n` also remains the same, as it is not directly related to the loop head.

The state of `left` is not directly related to the loop head, so we cannot adjust it. However, since `i` is now the second element in the list `a`, `left` should contain two elements 0 and the new value of `i`.

The state of `last` is not directly related to the loop head, so we cannot adjust it.

The state of `ans` is not directly related to the loop head, so we cannot adjust it.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`a` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, `n` is a non-negative integer equal to the length of the list `a`, `left` is a list containing two elements 0 and the second element in the list `a`, `last` is a list containing n elements, `ans` is a list of n elements all equal to -1, `i` is the second element in the list `a`.**
