Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is a list of non-negative integers, n is a non-negative integer equal to the length of the list a, left is a list containing n+1 elements where the first element is 0 and the rest are the cumulative sums of the elements in a, last is a list containing n elements, ans is a list of n elements all equal to -1, i is the last element in the list a.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i] < a[i - 1]:
        ans[i] = 1
        continue
    x = left[i] - a[i] - 1
    inx = func_1(left, x)
    inx2 = last[i - 1]
    if inx2 < inx:
        inx = inx2
    if inx < 0:
        continue
    ans[i] = i + 1 - inx


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list of non-negative integers, `n` is a non-negative integer equal to the length of the list `a` and must be at least 2, `left` is a list containing `n+1` elements where the first element is 0 and the rest are the cumulative sums of the elements in `a`, `last` is a list containing `n` elements, `ans` is a list of `n` elements where if `a[i]` is less than `a[i - 1]`, the element at index `i` is `i + 1 - inx` and the rest are -1, otherwise all elements are -1, `i` is 1, `x` is `left[i] - a[i] - 1`, `inx` is the result of `func_1(left, x)`, `inx2` is `last[i - 1]`. If `inx2` is less than `inx`, then `inx` is equal to `last[i - 1]`. If the current value of `inx` is less than 0, the loop skips to the next iteration. Otherwise, the loop continues with the current value of `inx`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list of non-negative integers, `n` is a non-negative integer equal to the length of the list `a` and must be at least 3, `left` is a list containing `n+1` elements where the first element is 0 and the rest are the cumulative sums of the elements in `a`, `last` is a list containing `n` elements, `ans` is a list of `n` elements where if `a[i]` is less than `a[i - 1]`, the element at index `i` is `i + 1 - inx` and the rest are -1, otherwise all elements are -1, `i` is 2, `x` is `left[i] - a[i] - 1`, `inx` is the result of func_1(left, x), `inx2` is last[i - 1]. If inx2 is less than inx, then inx is equal to last[i - 1]. If the current value of inx is less than 0, the loop skips to the next iteration. Otherwise, the loop continues with the current value of inx.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of non-negative integers, `n` is a non-negative integer equal to the length of the list `a` and must be at least 4, `left` is a list containing `n+1` elements where the first element is 0 and the rest are the cumulative sums of the elements in `a`, `last` is a list containing `n` elements, `ans` is a list of `n` elements where `ans[3]` is `4 - inx` and if `a[i]` is less than `a[i - 1]`, the element at index `i` is 1 and the rest are -1, otherwise all elements are -1, `i` is 3, `x` is `left[3] - a[3] - 1`, `inx` is the result of `func_1(left, x)`, `inx2` is `last[2]`. If `inx2` is less than `inx`, then the function does not execute the if part. Otherwise, the loop or if statement we were directly inside is skipped and we move to the next iteration of the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
