Output State: **`a` is a list of non-negative integers, `n` is a non-negative integer equal to the length of the list `a` and must be at least 4, `left` is a list containing `n+1` elements where the first element is 0 and the rest are the cumulative sums of the elements in `a`, `last` is a list containing `n` elements, `ans` is a list of `n` elements where `ans[3]` is `4 - inx` and if `a[i]` is less than `a[i - 1]`, the element at index `i` is 1 and the rest are -1, otherwise all elements are -1, `i` is 3, `x` is `left[3] - a[3] - 1`, `inx` is the result of `func_1(left, x)`, `inx2` is `last[2]`. If `inx2` is less than `inx`, then the function does not execute the if part. Otherwise, the loop or if statement we were directly inside is skipped and we move to the next iteration of the loop.**

In this output state, the value of `ans[3]` has been updated to `4 - inx`, where `inx` is the result of `func_1(left, x)`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. Note that the value of `inx` is not explicitly calculated, as it depends on the implementation of `func_1`.
