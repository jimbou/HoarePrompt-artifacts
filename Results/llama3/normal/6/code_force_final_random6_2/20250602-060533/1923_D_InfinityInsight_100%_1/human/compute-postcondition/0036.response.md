Output State: **a is a list of non-negative integers, n is a non-negative integer equal to the length of the list a and must be at least 3, left is a list containing n+1 elements where the first element is 0 and the rest are the cumulative sums of the elements in a, last is a list containing n elements, ans is a list of n elements where the element at index i is 1 and the rest are -1 if a[i] is less than a[i - 1], otherwise all elements are -1, i is 2, x is left[i] - a[i] - 1, inx is the result of func_1(left, x), inx2 is last[i - 1].**

The code snippet modifies the value of `ans[i]` to 1, leaving all other variables unchanged. The value of `i` remains 2, and the values of `x`, `inx`, and `inx2` are not affected by the code. The list `a` and its length `n` remain the same, as do the lists `left` and `last`. The list `ans` is modified only at index `i`, which is 2.
