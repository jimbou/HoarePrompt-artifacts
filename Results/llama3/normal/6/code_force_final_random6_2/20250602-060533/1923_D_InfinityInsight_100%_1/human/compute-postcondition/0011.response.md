State: **`a` is a list of non-negative integers, `n` is a non-negative integer equal to the length of the list `a` and must be at least 3, `i` is 3. If the current value of `a[i]` is not equal to the current value of `a[i - 1]`, then `left` is a list containing a single element 0 and `last` is a list containing three elements 0, 1 and 2. Otherwise, `left` is a list containing a single element 0 and `last` is a list containing three elements -1, 0 and 2. `ans` is a list of `n` elements all equal to -1. If the current value of `a[i]` is equal to the current value of `a[i - 1]`, then `left` is a list containing a single element 0 and `last` is a list containing three elements 0, 1 and 1. Otherwise, `left` is a list containing a single element 0 and `last` is a list containing three elements -1, -1. `ans` is a list of `n` elements all equal to -1**
