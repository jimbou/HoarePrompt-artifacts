Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of non-negative integers, `n` is a non-negative integer equal to the length of the list `a` and must be at least 2, `i` is 1. If the current value of `a[i]` is not equal to the current value of `a[i - 1]`, then `left` is a list containing a single element 0 and `last` is a list containing two elements 0 and 1. Otherwise, `left` is a list containing a single element 0 and `last` is a list containing two elements -1. `ans` is a list of `n` elements all equal to -1.***
