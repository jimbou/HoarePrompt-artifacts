Output State: **The program returns a list 'ans' of 'n' elements where if a[i] is less than a[i - 1], the element at index i is 1 and the rest are -1, otherwise all elements are -1.**

In this output state, the list 'ans' contains 'n' elements, where 'n' is the length of the list 'a'. The elements in 'ans' are determined by comparing the elements in 'a'. If an element in 'a' is less than the previous element, the corresponding element in 'ans' is 1, otherwise it is -1.
