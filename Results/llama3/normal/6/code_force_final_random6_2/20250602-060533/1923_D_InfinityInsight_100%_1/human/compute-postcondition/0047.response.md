Output State: **a is a list of non-negative integers, n is a non-negative integer equal to the length of the list a and must be at least 4, left is a list containing n+1 elements where the first element is 0 and the rest are the cumulative sums of the elements in a, last is a list containing n elements, ans is a list of n elements where if a[i] is less than a[i - 1], the element at index i is 1 and the rest are -1, otherwise all elements are -1, i is 3, x is left[i] - a[i] - 1, inx is the result of func_1(left, x), inx2 is last[i - 1].**

The code block modifies the values of `x`, `inx`, and `inx2`. The value of `x` is updated to be `left[i] - a[i] - 1`, where `i` is 3. The value of `inx` is updated to be the result of `func_1(left, x)`, where `x` is the new value calculated above. The value of `inx2` is updated to be `last[i - 1]`, where `i` is 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
