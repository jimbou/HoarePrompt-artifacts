To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The only variable in the loop head is `i` and the iterable is `a`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If `a` is not empty, the loop can execute. Since `n` is the length of the list `a` and is non-negative, we can infer that `a` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `a` to ensure it has at least one element, and we also need to adjust the state of `i` to be the first element in the list `a`.

State: **`a` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `n` is a non-negative integer equal to the length of the list `a`, `left` is a list containing a single element 0, `last` is a list containing n elements, `ans` is a list of n elements all equal to -1, `i` is the first element in the list `a`**
