Output State: **a is a list of non-negative integers, n is a non-negative integer equal to the length of the list a and must be at least 2, left is a list containing n+1 elements where the first element is 0 and the rest are the cumulative sums of the elements in a, last is a list containing n elements, ans is a list of n elements where if a[i] is less than a[i - 1], the element at index i is 1 and the rest are -1, otherwise all elements are -1, i is 1, x is left[i] - a[i] - 1, inx is the result of func_1(left, x), inx2 is last[i - 1].**

In this output state, the values of `a`, `n`, `left`, `last`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged from the initial state. The code introduces three new variables: `x`, `inx`, and `inx2`. The value of `x` is calculated as `left[i] - a[i] - 1`, where `i` is 1. The value of `inx` is the result of calling the function `func_1` with arguments `left` and `x`. The value of `inx2` is simply the value of `last[i - 1]`, which is the element at index 0 in the list `last`.
