Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is a list of non-negative integers, n is a non-negative integer equal to the length of the list a, left is a list containing a single element 0, last is a list containing n elements, ans is a list of n elements all equal to -1.
Code of the loop:
for i in a:
    left.append(left[-1] + i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `n` is a non-negative integer equal to the length of the list `a`, `left` is a list containing two elements 0 and `i`, `last` is a list containing n elements, `ans` is a list of n elements all equal to -1, `i` is the first element in the list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, `n` is a non-negative integer equal to the length of the list `a`, `left` is a list containing three elements 0, the second element in the list `a`, and the sum of the second element in the list `a` and the second element in the list `a`, `last` is a list containing n elements, `ans` is a list of n elements all equal to -1, `i` is the second element in the list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 3 elements, `n` is a non-negative integer equal to at least 3, `left` is a list containing four elements 0, the third element in the list `a`, the sum of the third element in the list `a` and the third element in the list `a`, and the sum of the third element in the list `a` and the third element in the list `a` and the third element in the list `a`, `last` is a list containing at least 3 elements, `ans` is a list of at least 3 elements all equal to -1, `i` is the third element in the list `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
