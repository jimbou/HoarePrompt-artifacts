To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 2, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to but does not include `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust `n` to be at least 2, and `i` will be 1 at the start of the loop.

State: **`a` is a list of non-negative integers, `n` is a non-negative integer equal to the length of the list `a` and must be at least 2, `left` is a list containing a single element 0, `last` is a list containing a single element -1, `ans` is a list of `n` elements all equal to -1, `i` is 1**
