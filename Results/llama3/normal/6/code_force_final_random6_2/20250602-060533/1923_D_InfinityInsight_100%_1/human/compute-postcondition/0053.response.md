Output State: **a is a list of non-negative integers, n is a non-negative integer equal to the length of the list a, left is a list containing n+1 elements where the first element is 0 and the rest are the cumulative sums of the elements in a, last is a list containing n elements, ans is a list of n elements where if a[i] is less than a[i - 1], the element at index i is 1 and the rest are -1, otherwise all elements are -1, i is n-1, x is left[n-1] - a[n-1] - 1, inx is the result of func_1(left, x), inx2 is last[n-2]. If inx2 is less than inx, then inx is equal to last[n-2]. If the current value of inx is less than 0, the loop skips to the next iteration. Otherwise, the loop continues with the current value of inx.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `a` remains unchanged, `n` remains the same, `left` remains the same, `last` remains the same, and `ans` is updated such that if `a[i]` is less than `a[i - 1]`, the element at index `i` is 1 and the rest are -1, otherwise all elements are -1. The variable `i` is now `n-1`, `x` is `left[n-1] - a[n-1] - 1`, `inx` is the result of `func_1(left, x)`, and `inx2` is `last[n-2]`. If `inx2` is less than `inx`, then `inx` is equal to `last[n-2]`. If the current value of `inx` is less than 0, the loop skips to the next iteration. Otherwise, the loop continues with the current value of `inx`.
