The code appends the sum of the last element in the list `left` and the value of `i` to the list `left`. The last element in the list `left` is 0, and `i` is the first element in the list `a`. 

Since `a` is a list of non-negative integers, the first element `i` is a non-negative integer. Therefore, the sum of 0 and `i` is equal to `i`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `n` is a non-negative integer equal to the length of the list `a`, `left` is a list containing two elements 0 and `i`, `last` is a list containing n elements, `ans` is a list of n elements all equal to -1, `i` is the first element in the list `a`.**
