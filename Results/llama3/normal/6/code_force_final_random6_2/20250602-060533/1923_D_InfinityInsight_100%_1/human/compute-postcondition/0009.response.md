Output State: **`a` is a list of non-negative integers, `n` is a non-negative integer equal to the length of the list `a` and must be at least 3, `i` is 2. If the current value of `a[i]` is not equal to the current value of `a[i - 1]`, then `left` is a list containing a single element 0 and `last` is a list containing three elements 0, 1 and 1. Otherwise, `left` is a list containing a single element 0 and `last` is a list containing three elements -1, -1. `ans` is a list of `n` elements all equal to -1.**

In this output state, the value of `last` has been updated by appending its last element to itself. If `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1]`, then `last` now contains three elements: 0, 1, and 1. Otherwise, `last` now contains three elements: -1, -1, and -1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
