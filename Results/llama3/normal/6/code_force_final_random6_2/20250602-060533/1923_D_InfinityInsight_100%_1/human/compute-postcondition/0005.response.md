Output State: **`a` is a list of non-negative integers, `n` is a non-negative integer equal to the length of the list `a` and must be at least 2, `left` is a list containing a single element 0, `last` is a list containing two elements -1, `ans` is a list of `n` elements all equal to -1, `i` is 1. The element at index `i` in list `a` is equal to the element at index `i-1` in list `a`.**

In this output state, the only change is that the list `last` now contains two elements, both of which are -1. The other variables remain unchanged.
