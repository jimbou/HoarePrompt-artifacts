To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Since `n` is at least 2, it must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables, `a`, `left`, `last`, and `ans`, are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`a` is a list of non-negative integers, `n` is a non-negative integer equal to the length of the list `a` and must be at least 3, `i` is 2. If the current value of `a[i]` is not equal to the current value of `a[i - 1]`, then `left` is a list containing a single element 0 and `last` is a list containing two elements 0 and 1. Otherwise, `left` is a list containing a single element 0 and `last` is a list containing two elements -1. `ans` is a list of `n` elements all equal to -1.**
