To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 2 (since the range starts from 1 and goes up to but not including `n`). Also, `i` should be 1 at the start of the loop.

State: **`a` is a list of non-negative integers, `n` is a non-negative integer equal to the length of the list `a` and must be at least 2, `left` is a list containing `n+1` elements where the first element is 0 and the rest are the cumulative sums of the elements in `a`, `last` is a list containing `n` elements, `ans` is a list of `n` elements all equal to -1, `i` is 1**
