Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is a list of non-negative integers, n is a non-negative integer equal to the length of the list a, left is a list containing a single element 0, last is a list containing a single element -1, ans is a list of n elements all equal to -1
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i] != a[i - 1]:
        last.append(i)
    else:
        last.append(last[-1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is a list of non-negative integers, `n` is a non-negative integer equal to the length of the list `a` and must be at least 2, `i` is 1. If the current value of `a[i]` is not equal to the current value of `a[i - 1]`, then `left` is a list containing a single element 0 and `last` is a list containing two elements 0 and 1. Otherwise, `left` is a list containing a single element 0 and `last` is a list containing two elements -1. `ans` is a list of `n` elements all equal to -1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list of non-negative integers, `n` is a non-negative integer equal to the length of the list `a` and must be at least 3, `i` is 2. If the current value of `a[i]` is not equal to the current value of `a[i - 1]`, then `left` is a list containing a single element 0 and `last` is a list containing three elements 0, 1 and 2. Otherwise, `left` is a list containing a single element 0 and `last` is a list containing three elements -1, 0 and 2. `ans` is a list of `n` elements all equal to -1. If the current value of `a[i]` is equal to the current value of `a[i - 1]`, then `left` is a list containing a single element 0 and `last` is a list containing three elements 0, 1 and 1. Otherwise, `left` is a list containing a single element 0 and `last` is a list containing three elements -1, -1. `ans` is a list of `n` elements all equal to -1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of non-negative integers, `n` is a non-negative integer equal to the length of the list `a` and must be at least 3, `i` is 3. If the current value of `a[i]` is not equal to the current value of `a[i - 1]`, then `left` is a list containing a single element 0 and `last` is a list containing four elements 0, 1, 2 and 3. If the current value of `a[i]` is equal to the current value of `a[i - 1]`, then `left` is a list containing a single element 0 and `last` is a list containing four elements 0, 1, 1 and 3. Otherwise, `left` is a list containing a single element 0 and `last` is a list containing four elements -1, 0, 1 and 1. `ans` is a list of `n` elements all equal to -1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
