Output State: **a is a list of non-negative integers, n is a non-negative integer equal to the length of the list a, left is a list containing n+1 elements where the first element is 0 and the rest are the cumulative sums of the elements in a, last is a list containing n elements, ans is a list of n elements all equal to -1, i is the last element in the list a.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state is as follows:

* The list `a` remains unchanged, containing non-negative integers.
* The variable `n` remains unchanged, equal to the length of the list `a`.
* The list `left` now contains `n+1` elements, where the first element is 0 and the rest are the cumulative sums of the elements in `a`. For example, if `a` is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, then `left` would be `[0, 1, 3, 6, 10]`.
* The list `last` remains unchanged, containing `n` elements.
* The list `ans` remains unchanged, containing `n` elements all equal to -1.
* The variable `i` now holds the value of the last element in the list `a`.
