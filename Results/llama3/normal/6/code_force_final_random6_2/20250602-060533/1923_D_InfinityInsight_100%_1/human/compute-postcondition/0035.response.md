The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`a` is a list of non-negative integers, `n` is a non-negative integer equal to the length of the list `a` and must be at least 3, `left` is a list containing `n+1` elements where the first element is 0 and the rest are the cumulative sums of the elements in `a`, `last` is a list containing `n` elements, `ans` is a list of `n` elements where if `a[i]` is less than `a[i - 1]`, the element at index `i` is `i + 1 - inx` and the rest are -1, otherwise all elements are -1, `i` is 2, `x` is `left[i] - a[i] - 1`, `inx` is the result of `func_1(left, x)`, `inx2` is `last[i - 1]`. If `inx2` is less than `inx`, then `inx` is equal to `last[i - 1]`. If the current value of `inx` is less than 0, the loop skips to the next iteration. Otherwise, the loop continues with the current value of `inx`.**
