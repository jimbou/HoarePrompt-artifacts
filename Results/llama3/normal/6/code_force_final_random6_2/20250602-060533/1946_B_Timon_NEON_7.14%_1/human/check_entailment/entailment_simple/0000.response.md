Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem where we have an array of integers and we can perform a certain number of operations on it. In each operation, we can select any contiguous subarray of the array and insert the sum of this subarray anywhere in the array. The goal is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after a certain number of operations.

The program uses two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` simply returns the remainder of the input number divided by 1000000007, which is used to prevent the sum from becoming too large.

`func_2` is used to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in the given array. It does this by iterating over the array and keeping track of the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray ending at each position. It also keeps track of the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray that ends at a position where the next element is negative. This is because if the next element is negative, it's better to start a new subarray at the next position.

The main part of the program reads the input, calls `func_2` to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray, and then calculates the maximum possible sum of the array after the given number of operations. It does this by multiplying the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray by 2 to the power of the number of operations, and then adding the sum of the entire array minus the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.

The program's logic is correct and it should produce the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
