Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers that is not empty, `new_segment` is a list containing at least one element, `max_segment` is a list containing two elements, `segments_variants` is a list, `max_sum` is -1, `i` is 0. If `arr[i]` is less than 0, then `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is a list containing two elements: the first element is the sum of the first element of the original `max_segment` and the value of `arr[i]`, and the second element is 0, and `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is a list containing three elements: the first two elements are zeros and the third element is -1 if the first element of `max_segment` is greater than the first element of the original `new_segment`. Otherwise, `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is the original `new_segment` + [i - 1]. If `arr[i]` is not less than 0, then `new_segment` is a list containing at least one element with its first element increased by the value of `arr[i]`, `max_segment` is a list containing two elements with its first element increased by the value of `arr[i]`, and `segments_variants` is an empty list.***
