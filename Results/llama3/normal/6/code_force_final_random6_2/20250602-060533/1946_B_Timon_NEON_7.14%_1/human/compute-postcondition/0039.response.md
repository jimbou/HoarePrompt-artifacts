Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that is not empty and has at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `max_sum` is -1, `max_segment` is a list containing two elements: the first element is the sum of `arr[0]`, `arr[2]`, and `arr[2]`, and the second element is 0, `new_segment` is a list containing two elements: the first element is the value of `arr[2]` and the second element is 2, and `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is the original `new_segment` + [i - 1] if `arr[2]` is less than 0, otherwise `segments_variants` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the value of `max_segment[0]` has been updated to include the value of `arr[i]`, which is `arr[2]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `arr` still has at least 3 elements, `i` is still 2, and `max_sum` is still -1. The values of `new_segment` and `segments_variants` are determined by the initial values of `new_segment`, `arr[0]`, and `arr[1]`, and are not affected by the update to `max_segment`.
