Output State: **arr is a list of integers that is not empty and has at least 3 elements, i is 2, max_sum is -1, new_segment is an empty list, max_segment is a list containing two elements with its first element increased by the value of arr[i], and segments_variants is either an empty list or a list containing one element which is a list containing three elements: the first two elements are zeros and the third element is -1, or a list containing one element which is the original new_segment + [i - 1], or a list containing one element which is max_segment + [i - 1].**

In this output state, the code has modified the `max_segment` list by increasing its first element by the value of `arr[i]`, and has reset the `new_segment` list to an empty list. The values of `arr`, `i`, and `max_sum` remain unchanged. The `segments_variants` list may have been modified depending on its original value, but its exact state is not specified.
