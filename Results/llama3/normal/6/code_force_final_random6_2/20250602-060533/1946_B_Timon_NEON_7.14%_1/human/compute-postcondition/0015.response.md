Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that is not empty, `new_segment` is a list containing `arr[i]` and `i`, `max_segment` is a list containing two zeros, `segments_variants` is an empty list, `max_sum` is -1, `i` is 0, and `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0.**

In this output state, the value of `new_segment` has been updated to a list containing the current value of `arr[i]` and the index `i`, while the other variables remain unchanged. The list `new_segment` now contains two elements: the value of `arr[i]` and the index `i`, which is 0. The rest of the variables maintain their initial values.
