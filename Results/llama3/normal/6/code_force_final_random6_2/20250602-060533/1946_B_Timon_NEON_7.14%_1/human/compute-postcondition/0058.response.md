Functionality: **This function takes a list of integers as input and returns the segment with the maximum sum. A segment is defined as a contiguous subarray within the input list. If the maximum sum is found in a segment of length 1, the function returns a list containing a single element -1. Otherwise, it returns a list containing the start index, end index, and sum of the maximum sum segment. If no such segment exists, it returns a list containing a single element -1.**
