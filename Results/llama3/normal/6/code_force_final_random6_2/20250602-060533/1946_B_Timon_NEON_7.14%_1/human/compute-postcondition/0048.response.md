Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is a list containing two elements: the first element is the sum of all elements in `arr` and the second element is 0, `segments_variants` is a list containing at least 2 segments which are lists containing three elements: the first two elements are the start and end indices of a segment in `arr` and the third element is the sum of the elements in the segment, `max_sum` is the maximum sum of the segments in `segments_variants`, `total_max_segment` is the segment**

The value of `total_max_segment` is updated to be the segment, which is one of the segments in `segments_variants`. The other variables remain unchanged.
