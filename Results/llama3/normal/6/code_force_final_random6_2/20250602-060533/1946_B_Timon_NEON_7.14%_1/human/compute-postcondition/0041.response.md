Output State: **arr is a list of integers, new_segment is an empty list, max_segment is a list containing two elements: the first element is the sum of all elements in arr and the second element is 0, segments_variants is a list containing one or more elements which are lists containing three elements: the first two elements are the start and end indices of a segment in arr and the third element is the sum of the elements in the segment, max_sum is the maximum sum of the segments in segments_variants.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a state where the loop has processed all the elements in the input list `arr`. The `new_segment` list is empty, indicating that the loop has finished processing all segments in `arr`. The `max_segment` list contains the sum of all elements in `arr` and the index 0, indicating that the maximum sum of a segment in `arr` is the sum of all elements in `arr`. The `segments_variants` list contains one or more elements, each representing a segment in `arr` with its start and end indices and the sum of its elements. The `max_sum` variable contains the maximum sum of the segments in `segments_variants`.
