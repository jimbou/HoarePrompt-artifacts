Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: arr is a list of integers, new_segment is an empty list, max_segment is a list containing two elements: the first element is the sum of all elements in arr and the second element is 0, segments_variants is a list containing one or more elements which are lists containing three elements: the first two elements are the start and end indices of a segment in arr and the third element is the sum of the elements in the segment, and two additional elements: the first additional element is the max_segment with the last index of arr appended and the second additional element is the new_segment with the last index of arr appended, max_sum is the maximum sum of the segments in segments_variants, total_max_segment is a list containing a single element -1.
Code of the loop:
for segment in segments_variants:
    if total_max_segment[0] < segment[0]:
        total_max_segment = segment


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is a list containing two elements: the first element is the sum of all elements in `arr` and the second element is 0, `segments_variants` is a list containing at least 1 segment which is a list containing three elements: the first two elements are the start and end indices of a segment in `arr` and the third element is the sum of the elements in the segment, `max_sum` is the maximum sum of the segments in `segments_variants`. If the first element of the first segment in `segments_variants` is greater than the first element of `total_max_segment`, then `total_max_segment` is updated to be the first segment in `segments_variants`. Otherwise, `total_max_segment` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is a list containing two elements: the first element is the sum of all elements in `arr` and the second element is 0, `segments_variants` is a list containing at least 2 segments which are lists containing three elements: the first two elements are the start and end indices of a segment in `arr` and the third element is the sum of the elements in the segment, `max_sum` is the maximum sum of the segments in `segments_variants`. If the start index of `total_max_segment` is less than the start index of `segment`, then `total_max_segment` is updated to `segment`. Otherwise, `total_max_segment` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is a list containing two elements: the first element is the sum of all elements in `arr` and the second element is 0, `segments_variants` is a list containing at least 3 segments which are lists containing three elements: the first two elements are the start and end indices of a segment in `arr` and the third element is the sum of the elements in the segment, `max_sum` is the maximum sum of the segments in `segments_variants`. If the sum of the third segment in `segments_variants` is greater than the sum of all elements in `arr`, then `total_max_segment` is updated to the third segment in the list. Otherwise, `total_max_segment` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
