Output State: **arr is a list of integers that is not empty, i is 1, max_sum is -1, new_segment is a list containing at least one element with its first element increased by the value of arr[i], max_segment is a list containing two elements with its first element increased by the value of arr[i], and segments_variants is a list containing one element which is the original new_segment + [i - 1].**

The code first appends the current `new_segment` plus the index `i - 1` to `segments_variants`. This adds a new element to `segments_variants` that includes the original `new_segment` and the index `i - 1`. 

Then, it assigns the value of `new_segment` to `max_segment`. This updates `max_segment` to be the same as `new_segment`, which means it now contains at least one element with its first element increased by the value of `arr[i]`. 

No other variables are affected by the code. The value of `arr`, `i`, and `max_sum` remains the same. The value of `new_segment` is not changed by the code, but its value is used to update `max_segment`. The value of `segments_variants` is updated by appending a new element.
