The only object in the loop head is variable  segment and list segments_variants, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the segments_variants.  If the list has at least 3 segments the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, segments_variants has at least 2 segments, segment is the second segment in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 segments and the segment is the third segment in the list.
State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is a list containing two elements: the first element is the sum of all elements in `arr` and the second element is 0, `segments_variants` is a list containing at least 3 segments which are lists containing three elements: the first two elements are the start and end indices of a segment in `arr` and the third element is the sum of the elements in the segment, `max_sum` is the maximum sum of the segments in `segments_variants`, segment is the third segment in the list.**
