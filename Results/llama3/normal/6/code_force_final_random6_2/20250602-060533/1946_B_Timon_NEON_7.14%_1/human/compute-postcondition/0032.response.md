Output State: **arr is a list of integers that is not empty and has at least 3 elements, i is 2, max_sum is -1, new_segment is a list containing at least one element with its last element increased by the value of i - 1, max_segment is a list containing two elements with its first element increased by the value of arr[i], and segments_variants is a list containing one element which is the original new_segment + [i - 1].**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The list of integers `arr` remains unchanged, with at least 3 elements. The value of `i` is still 2. The variable `max_sum` remains -1. The list `new_segment` has been modified to include an additional element, which is the value of `i - 1`. The list `max_segment` has also been modified, with its first element increased by the value of `arr[i]`. The list `segments_variants` now contains one element, which is the original `new_segment` with an additional element `i - 1` appended to it.
