Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers that is not empty, `i` is 1, `max_sum` is -1. If `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is a list containing `arr[0]` and 0, `max_segment` is a list containing `arr[0]` and 0, and `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is a list containing three elements: the first two elements are `arr[0]` and 0, and the third element is 0. If `arr[0]` is less than 0, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is a list containing two elements: the first element is the sum of `arr[0]` and 0, and the second element is 0, and `segments_variants` is a list containing two elements: the first element is a list containing three elements: the first two elements are zeros and the third element is -1, and the second element is a list containing three elements: the first two elements are the sum of `arr[0]` and 0, and 0, and the third element is 0. If `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`, then `new_segment` is a list containing at least one element with its first element increased by the value of `arr[i]`, `max_segment` is a list containing two elements with its first element increased by the value of `arr[i]`, and `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is the original `new_segment` + [i - 1]. Otherwise, `new_segment` is a list containing at least one element with its first element increased by the value of `arr[i]`, `max_segment` is a list containing two elements with its first element increased by the value of `arr[i]`, and `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is the original `new_segment` + [i - 1].***
