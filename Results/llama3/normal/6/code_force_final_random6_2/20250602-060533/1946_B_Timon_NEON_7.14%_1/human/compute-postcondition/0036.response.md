Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers that is not empty and has at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `max_sum` is -1. If `arr[i]` is less than 0, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is a list containing two elements with its first element increased by the value of `arr[i]`, and `segments_variants` is either an empty list or a list containing one element which is a list containing three elements: the first two elements are zeros and the third element is -1, or a list containing one element which is the original `new_segment` + [i - 1], or a list containing one element which is `max_segment` + [i - 1]. If `arr[i]` is not less than 0, `new_segment` is a list containing at least one element with its first element increased by the value of `arr[i]` twice, `max_segment` is a list containing two elements with its first element increased by the value of `arr[i]` twice, and `segments_variants` is either an empty list or a list containing one element which is a list containing three elements: the first two elements are zeros and the third element is -1.***
