Output State: **arr is a list of integers that is not empty, new_segment is a list containing at least one element, max_segment is a list containing at least one element, segments_variants is a list containing one element which is new_segment + [i - 1], max_sum is -1, i is 0. The current value of new_segment is not empty. The current value of arr[i] is less than 0.**

The code executes two lines. The first line appends a new element to the `segments_variants` list, which is the `new_segment` list extended with the value of `i - 1`. Since `i` is 0, `i - 1` is -1, so the new element appended to `segments_variants` is `new_segment + [-1]`. The second line assigns the value of `new_segment` to `max_segment`, effectively replacing the previous value of `max_segment` which was a list containing two zeros. 

After the code executes, `arr` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. `new_segment` also remains unchanged as it is not modified after its value is assigned to `max_segment`. `max_segment` now contains the same elements as `new_segment`. `segments_variants` now contains one element which is `new_segment + [-1]`. `max_sum` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. `i` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The current value of `new_segment` is still not empty. The current value of `arr[i]` is still less than 0.
