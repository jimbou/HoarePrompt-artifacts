Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers that is not empty, `new_segment` is a list containing at least one element, `max_segment` is a list containing two zeros, `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is a list containing three elements: the first two elements are zeros and the third element is -1, `max_sum` is -1, `i` is 0. The current value of `new_segment` is not empty. The current value of `arr[i]` is less than 0. If the first element of `max_segment` is greater than the first element of `new_segment`, then `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is a list containing three elements: the first two elements are zeros and the third element is -1. Otherwise, `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is `new_segment` + [i - 1].***
