Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that is not empty, `i` is 0, `max_segment` is a list containing `arr[0]` and 0, `segments_variants` is an empty list, `max_sum` is -1. If `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is a list containing `arr[0]` and 0.**

In this output state, the value of `max_segment[0]` has been updated to include the value of `arr[i]`, which is `arr[0]` since `i` is 0. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for `new_segment` is still dependent on the value of `arr[0]`.
