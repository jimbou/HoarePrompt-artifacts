Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem. The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of the array after k operations, where in each operation, a contiguous subarray is selected and its sum is inserted anywhere in the array. The program does not correctly implement this logic.

One case where the program does not work correctly is when the input array contains negative numbers. The program's function `func_2` tries to find the maximum segment of the array that has a positive sum, but it does not correctly handle the case where the maximum segment has a negative sum. In such cases, the program will not correctly calculate the maximum possible sum of the array after k operations.

For example, if the input array is `[-4, -7]` and `k = 2`, the program will not correctly calculate the maximum possible sum of the array after 2 operations. The correct answer is `999999996`, but the program will not produce this result.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
