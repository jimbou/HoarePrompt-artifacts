Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is a list containing two elements: the first element is the sum of all elements in `arr` and the second element is 0, `segments_variants` is a list containing at least 3 segments which are lists containing three elements: the first two elements are the start and end indices of a segment in `arr` and the third element is the sum of the elements in the segment, `max_sum` is the maximum sum of the segments in `segments_variants`, `total_max_segment` is the third segment in the list which is a list containing three elements: the first two elements are the start and end indices of a segment in `arr` and the third element is the sum of the elements in the segment.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of integers `arr`, the empty list `new_segment`, the list `max_segment` containing the sum of all elements in `arr` and 0, the list `segments_variants` containing at least 3 segments with their start and end indices and sum of elements, and the maximum sum `max_sum` of the segments in `segments_variants` remain unchanged. The variable `total_max_segment` is now assigned the value of the third segment in the list `segments_variants`, which is a list containing the start and end indices of a segment in `arr` and the sum of the elements in that segment.
