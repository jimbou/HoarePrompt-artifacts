Output State: **arr is a list of integers that is not empty, new_segment is an empty list, max_segment is a list containing two elements: the first element is the sum of the first element of the original max_segment and the value of arr[i], and the second element is 0, segments_variants is a list containing one element which is a list containing three elements: the first two elements are zeros and the third element is -1, max_sum is -1, i is 0. The current value of new_segment is empty. The current value of arr[i] is less than 0. If the first element of max_segment is greater than the first element of the original new_segment, then segments_variants is a list containing one element which is a list containing three elements: the first two elements are zeros and the third element is -1. Otherwise, segments_variants is a list containing one element which is the original new_segment + [i - 1].**

In this output state, the value of `new_segment` has been reset to an empty list. The first element of `max_segment` has been incremented by the value of `arr[i]`, which is less than 0. The value of `segments_variants` depends on the comparison between the first element of `max_segment` and the first element of the original `new_segment`. If the first element of `max_segment` is greater, then `segments_variants` remains a list containing one element with three zeros and -1. Otherwise, `segments_variants` becomes a list containing one element which is the original `new_segment` plus `[i - 1]`. The values of `arr`, `max_sum`, and `i` remain unchanged.
