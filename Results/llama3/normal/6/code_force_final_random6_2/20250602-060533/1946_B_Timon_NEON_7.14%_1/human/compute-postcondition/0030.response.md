The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and arr, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `arr`. If `i` is less than `len(arr)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers that is not empty. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `arr` must have at least 3 elements.
State: **`arr` is a list of integers that is not empty and has at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `max_sum` is -1. If `new_segment` is not empty, then if `arr[i]` is less than 0, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is a list containing two elements: the first element is the sum of `arr[0]` and `arr[i]`, and the second element is 0, and `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is the original `new_segment` + [i - 1]. If `arr[i]` is not less than 0, then `new_segment` is a list containing at least one element with its first element increased by the value of `arr[i]`, `max_segment` is a list containing two elements with its first element increased by the value of `arr[i]`, and `segments_variants` is an empty list if the first element of `max_segment` is not greater than the first element of the original `new_segment`. Otherwise, `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is a list containing three elements: the first two elements are zeros and the third element is -1. If `new_segment` is empty, then if `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, then if `arr[1]` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is a list containing `arr[1]` and 1, `max_segment` is a list containing `arr[0]` + `arr[1]` and 0, and `segments_variants` is an empty list. If `arr[0]` is less than 0, then if `arr[1]` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is a list containing `arr[1]` and 1, `max_segment` is a list containing `arr[0]` + `arr[1]` and 0, and `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is a list containing three elements: the first two elements are zeros and the third element is -1. If `arr[1]` is less than 0, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is a list containing two elements: the first element is the sum of the first element of the original `max_segment` and the value of `arr[1]`, and the second element is 0, and `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is a list containing three elements: the first two elements are zeros and the third element is -1 if the first element of `max_segment` is greater than the first element of the original `new_segment`. Otherwise, `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is the original `new_segment` + [i - 1].**
