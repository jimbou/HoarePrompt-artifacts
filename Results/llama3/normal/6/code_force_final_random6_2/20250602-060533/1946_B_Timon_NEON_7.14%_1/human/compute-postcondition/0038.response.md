Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers that is not empty and has at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `max_sum` is -1. If `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0, then `new_segment` is a list containing two elements: the first element is the value of `arr[2]` and the second element is 2, `max_segment` is a list containing two elements: the first element is the sum of `arr[0]` and `arr[2]`, and the second element is 0, and `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is the original `new_segment` + [i - 1] if `arr[2]` is less than 0, otherwise `segments_variants` is an empty list. If `arr[i]` is less than 0, then the values of `new_segment`, `max_segment`, and `segments_variants` are determined by the initial values of `new_segment`, `arr[0]`, and `arr[1]`.**
