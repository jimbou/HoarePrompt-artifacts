Output State: **arr is a list of integers that is not empty and has at least 3 elements, i is 2, max_sum is -1, new_segment is a list containing at least one element with its first element increased by the value of arr[i] twice, max_segment is a list containing two elements with its first element increased by the value of arr[i] twice, and segments_variants is either an empty list or a list containing one element which is a list containing three elements: the first two elements are zeros and the third element is -1.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The code snippet modifies the values of `new_segment`, `max_segment`, and `segments_variants` based on the value of `arr[i]`. If `arr[i]` is not less than 0, `new_segment` and `max_segment` have their first elements increased by the value of `arr[i]` twice. If the first element of `max_segment` is greater than the first element of the original `new_segment`, `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is a list containing three elements: the first two elements are zeros and the third element is -1. Otherwise, `segments_variants` is an empty list. The values of `arr`, `i`, and `max_sum` remain unchanged.
