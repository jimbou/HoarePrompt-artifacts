Output State: **arr is a list of integers that is not empty, i is 1, max_sum is -1, new_segment is a list containing at least one element with its first element increased by the value of arr[i], max_segment is a list containing two elements with its first element increased by the value of arr[i], and segments_variants is an empty list if arr[i] is not less than 0. Otherwise, new_segment is an empty list, max_segment is a list containing two elements: the first element is the sum of the first element of the original max_segment and the value of arr[i], and the second element is 0, and segments_variants is a list containing one element which is a list containing three elements: the first two elements are zeros and the third element is -1 if the first element of max_segment is greater than the first element of the original new_segment. Otherwise, segments_variants is a list containing one element which is the original new_segment + [i - 1].**
