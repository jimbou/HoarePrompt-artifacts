#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of integers as input and returns the segment with the maximum sum. A segment is defined as a contiguous subarray within the input list. If the maximum sum is found in a segment of length 1, the function returns a list containing a single element -1. Otherwise, it returns a list containing the start index, end index, and sum of the maximum sum segment. If no such segment exists, it returns a list containing a single element -1.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: number is an integer and quantity is a non-negative integer.
    answer = 0

#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes an integer and a non-negative integer as input, and returns an integer value. The function's purpose is to perform some calculation or operation using the input values, and the final state of the program is that the answer variable holds the result of this calculation.
