Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that is not empty, `new_segment` is a list containing at least one element, `max_segment` is a list containing two zeros, `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is a list containing three elements: the first two elements are zeros and the third element is -1, `max_sum` is -1, `i` is 0. The current value of `new_segment` is not empty. The current value of `arr[i]` is less than 0. The first element of `max_segment` is greater than the first element of `new_segment`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of integers `arr` is not empty, and the list `new_segment` has at least one element. The list `max_segment` contains two zeros. The list `segments_variants` now contains one element, which is a list containing three elements: the first two elements are zeros, and the third element is -1. The value of `max_sum` is still -1, and the value of `i` is still 0. The current value of `new_segment` is not empty, and the current value of `arr[i]` is less than 0. The first element of `max_segment` is greater than the first element of `new_segment`.
