Output State: **arr is a list of integers that is not empty, i is 1, max_sum is -1, new_segment is an empty list, max_segment is a list containing two elements: the first element is the sum of arr[0] and arr[i], and the second element is 0, and segments_variants is a list containing one element which is the original new_segment + [i - 1].**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The list of integers `arr` remains unchanged. The value of `i` is still 1. The maximum sum `max_sum` is still -1. The `new_segment` list is empty. The `max_segment` list now contains the sum of the first two elements of `arr` and 0. The `segments_variants` list contains one element, which is the original `new_segment` list with the index `i - 1` appended to it.
