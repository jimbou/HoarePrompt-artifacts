Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: arr is a list of integers, new_segment is an empty list, max_segment is a list containing two zeros, segments_variants is an empty list, max_sum is -1
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(arr)):
    if new_segment:
        if arr[i] < 0:
            if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]:
                segments_variants.append(max_segment + [i - 1])
            else:
                segments_variants.append(new_segment + [i - 1])
                max_segment = new_segment
            new_segment = []
            max_segment[0] += arr[i]
        else:
            max_segment[0] += arr[i]
            new_segment[0] += arr[i]
    else:
        if arr[i] >= 0:
            new_segment = [arr[i], i]
        max_segment[0] += arr[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`arr` is a list of integers that is not empty, `i` is 0, `max_sum` is -1. If `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is a list containing `arr[0]` and 0, `max_segment` is a list containing `arr[0]` and 0, and `segments_variants` is an empty list. If `arr[0]` is less than 0, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is a list containing two elements: the first element is the sum of `arr[0]` and 0, and the second element is 0, and `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is a list containing three elements: the first two elements are zeros and the third element is -1. If `new_segment` is not empty, then if `arr[i]` is less than 0, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is a list containing two elements: the first element is the sum of the first element of the original `max_segment` and the value of `arr[i]`, and the second element is 0, and `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is a list containing three elements: the first two elements are zeros and the third element is -1 if the first element of `max_segment` is greater than the first element of the original `new_segment`. Otherwise, `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is the original `new_segment` + [i - 1]. If `arr[i]` is not less than 0, then `new_segment` is a list containing at least one element with its first element increased by the value of `arr[i]`, `max_segment` is a list containing two elements with its first element increased by the value of `arr[i]`, and `segments_variants` is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`arr` is a list of integers that is not empty, `i` is 1, `max_sum` is -1. If `new_segment` is not empty, then if `arr[i]` is less than 0, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is a list containing two elements: the first element is the sum of `arr[0]` and `arr[i]`, and the second element is 0, and `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is the original `new_segment` + [i - 1]. If `arr[i]` is not less than 0, then `new_segment` is a list containing at least one element with its first element increased by the value of `arr[i]`, `max_segment` is a list containing two elements with its first element increased by the value of `arr[i]`, and `segments_variants` is an empty list if the first element of `max_segment` is not greater than the first element of the original `new_segment`. Otherwise, `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is a list containing three elements: the first two elements are zeros and the third element is -1. If `new_segment` is empty, then if `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, then if `arr[1]` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is a list containing `arr[1]` and 1, `max_segment` is a list containing `arr[0]` + `arr[1]` and 0, and `segments_variants` is an empty list. If `arr[0]` is less than 0, then if `arr[1]` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is a list containing `arr[1]` and 1, `max_segment` is a list containing `arr[0]` + `arr[1]` and 0, and `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is a list containing three elements: the first two elements are zeros and the third element is -1. If `arr[1]` is less than 0, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is a list containing two elements: the first element is the sum of the first element of the original `max_segment` and the value of `arr[1]`, and the second element is 0, and `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is a list containing three elements: the first two elements are zeros and the third element is -1 if the first element of `max_segment` is greater than the first element of the original `new_segment`. Otherwise, `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is the original `new_segment` + [i - 1].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`arr` is a list of integers that is not empty and has at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `max_sum` is -1. If `new_segment` is not empty, then if `arr[i]` is less than 0, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is a list containing two elements with its first element increased by the value of `arr[i]`, and `segments_variants` is either an empty list or a list containing one element which is a list containing three elements: the first two elements are zeros and the third element is -1, or a list containing one element which is the original `new_segment` + [i - 1], or a list containing one element which is `max_segment` + [i - 1]. If `arr[i]` is not less than 0, `new_segment` is a list containing at least one element with its first element increased by the value of `arr[i]` twice, `max_segment` is a list containing two elements with its first element increased by the value of `arr[i]` twice, and `segments_variants` is either an empty list or a list containing one element which is a list containing three elements: the first two elements are zeros and the third element is -1. If `new_segment` is empty, `arr` is a list of integers that is not empty and has at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `max_sum` is -1, `max_segment` is a list containing two elements: the first element is the sum of `arr[0]`, `arr[2]`, and `arr[2]`, and the second element is 0, `new_segment` is a list containing two elements: the first element is the value of `arr[2]` and the second element is 2, and `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is the original `new_segment` + [i - 1] if `arr[2]` is less than 0, otherwise `segments_variants` is an empty list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
