Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that is not empty, `i` is 1, `max_sum` is -1. If `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is a list containing `arr[1]` and 1, `max_segment` is a list containing `arr[0]` and 0, and `segments_variants` is an empty list. If `arr[0]` is less than 0, `new_segment` is a list containing `arr[1]` and 1, `max_segment` is a list containing two elements: the first element is the sum of `arr[0]` and 0, and the second element is 0, and `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is a list containing three elements: the first two elements are zeros and the third element is -1.**

In this output state, the value of `new_segment` has been updated to a list containing `arr[1]` and 1, regardless of the value of `arr[0]`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
