To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for segment in segments_variants:`. This means that the only variable that can be adjusted is `segment`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `segments_variants` list. If the list has at least one more segment, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `segments_variants` has at least 1 segment. For the loop to execute again, `segments_variants` must have at least 2 segments.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is a list containing two elements: the first element is the sum of all elements in `arr` and the second element is 0, `segments_variants` is a list containing at least 2 segments which are lists containing three elements: the first two elements are the start and end indices of a segment in `arr` and the third element is the sum of the elements in the segment, `max_sum` is the maximum sum of the segments in `segments_variants`, `total_max_segment` is either the first segment in `segments_variants` or remains unchanged**
