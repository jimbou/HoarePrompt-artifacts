Output State: **arr is a list of integers, new_segment is an empty list, max_segment is a list containing two elements: the first element is the sum of all elements in arr and the second element is 0, segments_variants is a list containing one or more elements which are lists containing three elements: the first two elements are the start and end indices of a segment in arr and the third element is the sum of the elements in the segment, and two additional elements: the first additional element is the max_segment with the last index of arr appended and the second additional element is the new_segment with the last index of arr appended, max_sum is the maximum sum of the segments in segments_variants, total_max_segment is a list containing a single element -1.**

In this output state, the code has appended two new elements to the segments_variants list: the first is the max_segment with the last index of arr appended, and the second is the new_segment with the last index of arr appended. The total_max_segment variable has been initialized with a single element -1. The other variables remain unchanged.
