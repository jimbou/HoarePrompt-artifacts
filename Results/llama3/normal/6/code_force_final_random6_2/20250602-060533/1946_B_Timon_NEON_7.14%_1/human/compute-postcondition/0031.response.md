Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that is not empty and has at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing at least one element with its first element increased by the value of `arr[i]`, `max_segment` is a list containing two elements with its first element increased by the value of `arr[i]`, and `segments_variants` is either an empty list or a list containing one element which is a list containing three elements: the first two elements are zeros and the third element is -1, or a list containing one element which is the original `new_segment` + [i - 1], or a list containing one element which is `max_segment` + [i - 1].**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of integers `arr` remains unchanged, the value of `i` is still 2, and the value of `max_sum` is still -1. The list `new_segment` is either empty or has its first element increased by the value of `arr[i]`. The list `max_segment` has its first element increased by the value of `arr[i]`. The list `segments_variants` is either empty or contains one element which is a list of three zeros and -1, or contains one element which is the original `new_segment` plus the index `i - 1`, or contains one element which is `max_segment` plus the index `i - 1`.
