Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that is not empty and has at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is a list containing two elements: the first element is the value of `arr[2]` and the second element is 2, `max_segment` is a list containing two elements: the first element is the sum of `arr[0]` and `arr[2]`, and the second element is 0, and `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is the original `new_segment` + [i - 1] if `arr[2]` is less than 0, otherwise `segments_variants` is an empty list.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `arr` remains unchanged, `i` is still 2, and `max_sum` is still -1. The list `new_segment` now contains the value of `arr[2]` and the index 2. The list `max_segment` contains the sum of `arr[0]` and `arr[2]` as its first element and 0 as its second element. The list `segments_variants` contains the original `new_segment` plus the index `i-1` if `arr[2]` is negative, otherwise it is an empty list.
