To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `segment` and `segments_variants`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `segments_variants`. If `segments_variants` has at least 1 segment, the loop can execute.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is a list containing two elements: the first element is the sum of all elements in `arr` and the second element is 0, `segments_variants` is a list containing at least 1 segment which is a list containing three elements: the first two elements are the start and end indices of a segment in `arr` and the third element is the sum of the elements in the segment, `max_sum` is the maximum sum of the segments in `segments_variants`, `total_max_segment` is a list containing a single element -1, `segment` is the first segment in `segments_variants`**
