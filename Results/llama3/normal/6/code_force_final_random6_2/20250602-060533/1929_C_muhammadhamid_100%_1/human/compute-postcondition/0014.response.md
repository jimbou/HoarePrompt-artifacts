Output State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is at least 1, `a` is an integer, `s` is at least 2, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs, `i` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to be at least 2, as it is incremented by the result of the expression `s // (k - 1) + 1`, which is at least 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs, and the values of `k`, `x`, `a`, and `i` are still the same as in the initial state.
