Output State: **k is an integer, x is 0, a is an integer, s is x + 1 plus x times s // (k - 1), stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs, i is x - 1**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that k remains an integer, x becomes 0, a remains an integer, s becomes x + 1 plus x times s // (k - 1), stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs, and i becomes x - 1.
