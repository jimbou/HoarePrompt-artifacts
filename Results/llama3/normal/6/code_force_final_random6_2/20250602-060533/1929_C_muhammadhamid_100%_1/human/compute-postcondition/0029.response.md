Output State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is an integer that must be greater than 2, `a` is an integer, `s` is 4 + 4 * s // (k - 1), `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs, `i` is 2**

The code increments the value of `s` by adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` to it. Since `s` was initially equal to `2 + 2 * s // (k - 1)`, the new value of `s` becomes `2 + 2 * s // (k - 1) + s // (k - 1) + 1`, which simplifies to `4 + 4 * s // (k - 1)`. The values of the other variables, `k`, `x`, `a`, `stdin`, and `i`, remain unchanged.
