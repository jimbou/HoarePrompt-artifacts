Output State: **k is an integer, x is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, a is an integer, s is x + x * s // (k - 1), stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs, i is x - 1, and 'Yes' is printed if a is greater than or equal to s, otherwise 'No' is printed**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the final values of the variables are as follows:

*   `k` remains an integer.
*   `x` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, indicating that the loop has executed at least 0 times.
*   `a` remains an integer.
*   `s` has been updated to `x + x * s // (k - 1)`, which is the result of the loop's execution.
*   `stdin` still contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs.
*   `i` is now `x - 1`, indicating that the loop has executed `x` times.
*   The output is still 'Yes' if `a` is greater than or equal to `s`, and 'No' otherwise.
