To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the initial state and the condition within the print statement.

1. **Initial State**:
   - `k` is an integer.
   - `x` is 0.
   - `a` is an integer.
   - `s` is calculated as `x + 1` plus `x` times `s // (k - 1)`. Given `x` is 0, `s` simplifies to just `x + 1`, which equals 1.
   - `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs. This information doesn't directly affect the calculation but indicates the context of the program.
   - `i` is `x - 1`, which equals -1.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The statement prints 'Yes' if `a >= s` and 'No' otherwise.

Given the initial state, `s` is 1. The condition `a >= s` checks if `a` is greater than or equal to 1.

- If `a` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, the statement will print 'Yes'.
- If `a` is an integer less than 1, the statement will print 'No'.

Since the exact value of `a` is not provided, we can't definitively say whether 'Yes' or 'No' will be printed. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output 'Yes' if `a` is greater than or equal to 1 and 'No' otherwise.

Output: **'Yes' if a is greater than or equal to 1, 'No' otherwise**
