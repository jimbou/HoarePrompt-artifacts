Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Sasha can guarantee having at least n coins by placing bets in a casino with certain rules.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program reads the number of test cases (t) and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads three integers: k (the number of times the bet is increased in case of a win), x (the maximum number of consecutive losses), and a (the initial number of coins Sasha has).
3. The program initializes a variable s to 1, which represents the minimum amount of coins Sasha needs to have to guarantee winning.
4. The program then enters a loop that runs x times, where x is the maximum number of consecutive losses. In each iteration, it calculates the new value of s by adding the current value of s divided by (k-1) plus 1. This is based on the fact that Sasha needs to have enough coins to cover the maximum number of consecutive losses, and the bet amount must be a positive integer.
5. After the loop, the program checks if the initial number of coins Sasha has (a) is greater than or equal to the calculated value of s. If it is, it prints "Yes", indicating that Sasha can guarantee having at least n coins. Otherwise, it prints "No".

The program's logic is correct because it takes into account the rules of the casino and the constraints on the bet amount. By calculating the minimum amount of coins Sasha needs to have to guarantee winning, the program can determine whether Sasha can achieve his goal.

Correctness: **True**
