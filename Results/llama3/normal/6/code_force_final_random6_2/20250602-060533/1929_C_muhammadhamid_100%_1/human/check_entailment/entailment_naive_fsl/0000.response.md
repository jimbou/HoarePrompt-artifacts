Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the strategy described in the problem statement. The key insight is that Sasha can guarantee a win by placing bets in a way that ensures he has enough coins to cover the maximum number of consecutive losses.

The program calculates the minimum number of coins Sasha needs to have in order to guarantee a win, which is the sum of the first `x` terms of the sequence `s = 1, s + s // (k - 1) + 1, ...`. This sequence represents the number of coins Sasha needs to have in order to cover the maximum number of consecutive losses, assuming he wins the next bet.

The program then checks if Sasha's initial number of coins `a` is greater than or equal to the calculated minimum number of coins `s`. If it is, the program prints "Yes", indicating that Sasha can guarantee a win. Otherwise, it prints "No".

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where `x` is 1 or `a` is 1. It also correctly handles the case where `k` is 2, which is the minimum value of `k` allowed by the problem statement.

Overall, the program is correct and accurately implements the strategy described in the problem statement.
