The only objects in the loop head are variable `_` and stdin, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the stdin.  If the stdin has at least 1 test case the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs. So for the loop to be executed one more time the stdin must have at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.
State: **k is an integer, x is 0, a is an integer, s is x + 1 plus x times s // (k - 1), stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, i is x - 1, and this is printed: 'Yes' if a is greater than or equal to s, otherwise 'No'**
