Let's analyze the code step by step:

`s` is updated to be the sum of its current value, the integer division of `s` by `(k - 1)`, and 1.

Since `s` is initially 4 plus 2 times `s // (k - 1)`, we can substitute this expression into the update:

`s` becomes `4 + 2 * (s // (k - 1)) + s // (k - 1) + 1`

Combine like terms:

`s` becomes `4 + 3 * (s // (k - 1)) + 1`

Simplify:

`s` becomes `5 + 3 * (s // (k - 1))`

The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is greater than 2, `a` is an integer, `s` is 5 plus 3 times `s // (k - 1)`, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs, `i` is 2**
