Based on the precondition, the code will print 'Yes' if the value of `a` is greater than or equal to the value of `s`, and 'No' otherwise.

The value of `s` is at least 2 + (x - 1) * (s // (k - 1)) + (x - 1), which is a calculated value based on the values of `x`, `k`, and `s`. However, the exact value of `s` is not provided, so we can't determine its exact numerical value.

The value of `a` is an integer, but its exact value is not provided.

The value of `i` is x - 1, but it is not used in the print statement.

Therefore, the output will be either 'Yes' or 'No', depending on the values of `a` and `s`.

Output: **Yes if a is greater than or equal to s, No otherwise**
