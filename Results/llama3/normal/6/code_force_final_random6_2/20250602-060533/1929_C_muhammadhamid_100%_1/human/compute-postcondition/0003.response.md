Output State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is greater than 0, `a` is an integer, `s` is 2 plus `s // (k - 1)`, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs, `i` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to be 2 plus the integer division of `s` by `k-1`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs, and the value of `i` is still 0.
