To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `x` is at least 2.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `x` remains the same, which is at least 2.

State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is at least 2, `a` is an integer, `s` is at least 2 + s // (k - 1) + 1, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs, `i` is 2**
