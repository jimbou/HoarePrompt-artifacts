Output State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is an integer that must be greater than 1, `a` is an integer, `s` is 2 + 2 * s // (k - 1), `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs, `i` is 1**

The value of `s` is updated by adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` to its previous value, which was `1 + 1 + s // (k - 1)`. This simplifies to `2 + 2 * s // (k - 1)`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
