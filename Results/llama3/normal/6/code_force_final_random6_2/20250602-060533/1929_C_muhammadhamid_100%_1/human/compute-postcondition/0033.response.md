Output State: **k is an integer, x is an integer, a is an integer, s is x + x * s // (k - 1), stdin contains no test cases, i is x - 1, and 'Yes' is printed if a is greater than or equal to s, otherwise 'No' is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the values of k, x, and a remain unchanged as integers. The value of s has been updated according to the loop's calculation, which depends on the values of x and k. The standard input (stdin) is empty, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The loop counter i is at its final value, which is x - 1. Finally, the output is either 'Yes' or 'No', depending on whether the value of a is greater than or equal to the calculated value of s.
