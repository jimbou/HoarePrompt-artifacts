Output State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is at least 2, `a` is an integer, `s` is at least 2 + 2 * (s // (k - 1)) + 2, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs, `i` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to be at least 2 + 2 * (s // (k - 1)) + 2, which is the result of adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` to the original value of `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.
