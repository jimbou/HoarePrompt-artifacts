Output State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is at least 2, `a` is an integer, `s` is at least 2 + s // (k - 1) + 1, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs, `i` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated by adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` to its original value. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `s` is now at least 2 + s // (k - 1) + 1, which means it has increased by at least 1 and possibly more depending on the value of `k`. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs, and the value of `i` remains 1.
