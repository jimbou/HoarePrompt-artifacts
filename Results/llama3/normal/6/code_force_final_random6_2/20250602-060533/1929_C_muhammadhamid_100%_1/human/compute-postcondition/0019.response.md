Output State: **k is an integer, x is an integer, a is an integer, s is at least 2 + (x - 1) * (s // (k - 1)) + (x - 1), stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs, i is x - 1**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that k remains an integer, x remains an integer, a remains an integer, s is at least 2 plus (x - 1) times the result of s divided by (k - 1) plus (x - 1), stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs, and i is x - 1.
