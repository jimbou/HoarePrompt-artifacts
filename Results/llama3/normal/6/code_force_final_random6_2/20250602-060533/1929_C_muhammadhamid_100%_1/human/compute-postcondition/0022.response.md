To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states accordingly.


The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable in the loop head is the loop variable `_`, which is not explicitly used in the state description. However, the loop condition depends on the value returned by `int(input())`, which is not explicitly stated in the state description.


Since we cannot adjust the value of `int(input())`, we can only adjust the state of the loop variable `_`. In Python, the loop variable `_` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration.


State: **k is an integer, x is an integer, a is an integer, s is at least 2 + (x - 1) * (s // (k - 1)) + (x - 1), stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, i is x, and 'Yes' is printed if a is greater than or equal to s, otherwise 'No' is printed**
