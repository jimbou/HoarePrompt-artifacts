To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `x`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `x` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `x` remains the same, but since `i` is now 2, `x` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is an integer that must be greater than 2, `a` is an integer, `s` is 2 + 2 * s // (k - 1), `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs, `i` is 2**
