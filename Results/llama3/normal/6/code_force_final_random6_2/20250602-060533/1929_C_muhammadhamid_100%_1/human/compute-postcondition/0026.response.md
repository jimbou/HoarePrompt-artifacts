To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `x` is greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 1. For the loop to execute again, `x` must be greater than 1.

State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is an integer that must be greater than 1, `a` is an integer, `s` is 1 + 1 + s // (k - 1), `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs, `i` is 1**
