Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of three integers: k, x, and a.
2. The program calculates the value of s, which represents the minimum amount of money Sasha needs to have in order to guarantee that he can win any number of coins. The calculation of s is based on the formula s = 1 + s // (k - 1) + 1, which is repeated x times. This formula is derived from the fact that Sasha can lose at most x times in a row, and each time he loses, he needs to bet more money to recover his losses.
3. The program then checks if the initial amount of money Sasha has (a) is greater than or equal to the calculated value of s. If it is, the program prints "Yes", indicating that Sasha can guarantee that he can win any number of coins. Otherwise, it prints "No".

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the strategy described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
