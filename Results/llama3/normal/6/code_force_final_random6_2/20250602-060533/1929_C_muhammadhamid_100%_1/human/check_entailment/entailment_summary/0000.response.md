Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the strategy described in the problem statement. The variable `s` is used to calculate the maximum amount of coins Sasha needs to have in order to guarantee a win. This is done by simulating the worst-case scenario where Sasha loses `x` times in a row, and then wins once. The amount `s` is calculated by adding the amount needed to win after each loss, which is `s // (k - 1) + 1`. This is because Sasha needs to have enough coins to cover the loss and then win the next bet.

The program then checks if the initial amount of coins `a` is greater than or equal to `s`. If it is, then Sasha can guarantee a win, and the program prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

The program correctly handles the case where `k` is 2, which is a special case because the amount needed to win after each loss is always 1. The program also correctly handles the case where `x` is 1, which means Sasha cannot lose more than once in a row.

Overall, the program correctly implements the strategy described in the problem statement and produces the correct output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
