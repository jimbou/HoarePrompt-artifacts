Output State: **k is an integer, x is an integer that must be greater than 0, a is an integer, s is 1 + 1 + s // (k - 1), stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs, i is 0, and 'Yes' is printed if a is greater than or equal to s, otherwise 'No' is printed**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of k remains unchanged as an integer. The value of x remains unchanged as an integer greater than 0. The value of a remains unchanged as an integer. The value of s is updated to be 1 plus 1 plus the integer division of s by (k - 1). The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs. The value of i remains unchanged as 0. The program still prints 'Yes' if a is greater than or equal to s, otherwise it prints 'No'.
