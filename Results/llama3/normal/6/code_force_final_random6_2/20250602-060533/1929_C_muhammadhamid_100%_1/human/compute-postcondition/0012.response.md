Output State: **k is an integer, x is an integer, a is an integer, s is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs, i is x - 1, and 'Yes' is printed if a is greater than or equal to s, otherwise 'No' is printed**

In this final state, the values of k, x, and a are updated to the integer values read from stdin. The value of s is reset to 1. Stdin now contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs. The value of i remains x - 1. The printed output is determined by the comparison between a and s, which is now 1.
