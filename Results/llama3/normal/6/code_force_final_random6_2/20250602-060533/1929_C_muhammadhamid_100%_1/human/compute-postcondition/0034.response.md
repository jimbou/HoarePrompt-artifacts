Functionality: **This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains three integers: k, x, and a. It calculates a value s based on k and x, and then prints 'Yes' if a is greater than or equal to s, otherwise it prints 'No'. The function continues processing test cases until all input has been consumed.**
