The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line decrements the value of `r` by 1, and the second line increments the value of `end` by 1.

Since `r` was initially equal to `n-3`, after the first line, `r` becomes `n-4`. The second line increments `end` from 2 to 3.

No other variables are affected by the code snippet. The values of `n`, `a`, `l`, `st`, and `_` remain unchanged. Stdin still contains multiple test cases - 1 input.

Output State: **n is an integer, a is a list of n integers where the last three elements are equal, l is less than n-3, r is n-4, st is the number of elements in a that are equal to the first element in a, end is 3, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1 input**
