The code prints the maximum value between 0 and `ans`. Where `ans` is determined by the following conditions:

*   If the first element of list `a` is equal to the last element of list `a`, then `ans` is -1.
*   If the first element of list `a` is not equal to the last element of list `a`, then if `st` (the number of elements in `a` that are equal to the first element in `a`) is 0 and `end` (which is equal to `n - l - 1`) is 0, `ans` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `ans` is 0.

Output: **n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, l is less than n, r is equal to l, st is the number of elements in a that are equal to the first element in a, end is equal to n - l - 1, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1 input. If the first element of a is equal to the last element of a, then ans is -1. If the first element of a is not equal to the last element of a, then if st is 0, end is 0, ans is n-1. Otherwise, ans is 0. and the maximum value between 0 and ans is printed**
