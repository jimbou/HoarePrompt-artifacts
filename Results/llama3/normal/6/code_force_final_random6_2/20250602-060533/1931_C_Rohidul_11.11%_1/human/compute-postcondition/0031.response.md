To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to consider the conditions in the `while` loop statement: `l < r` and `a[l] == a[l + 1]`.

1. For `l < r`, since `l` is 1 and `r` is `n - 1`, and we know `n` is greater than 1, this condition is already satisfied. No adjustment is needed here.

2. For `a[l] == a[l + 1]`, since `l` is 1, we are comparing the second element (`a[1]`) with the third element (`a[2]`). We know the first two elements are equal, but we don't have information about the third element. To ensure this condition is met, we need to adjust the state of `a` so that the second and third elements are equal.

State: **n is greater than 1, a is a list of n integers where the first three elements are equal, l is 1, r is n - 1, st is 1, end is 0, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1 input**
