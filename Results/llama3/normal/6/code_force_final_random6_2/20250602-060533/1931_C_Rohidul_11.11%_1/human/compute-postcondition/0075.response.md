Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where at least the last (`n` - `k`) elements are equal, `l` is `k`, `r` is `l`, `st` is 0, `end` is 0, `ans` is `n - 1`, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 inputs. The first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of elements in list `a` is still greater than 1. The list `a` still contains `n` integers, and at least the last (`n` - `k`) elements are still equal. The values of `l` and `r` are still equal to `k`. The values of `st` and `end` are still 0. A new variable `ans` is introduced, which is equal to `n - 1`, representing the length of list `a` minus 1. The stdin still contains multiple test cases with 2 inputs. The first element of `a` is still not equal to the last element of `a`.
