The only objects in the loop head are variables `_` and `input()`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input. If the input is at least 1, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains multiple test cases. So for the loop to be executed  the input must be at least 1 and `_` is 0.
State: **stdin contains multiple test cases, input is at least 1, _ is 0**
