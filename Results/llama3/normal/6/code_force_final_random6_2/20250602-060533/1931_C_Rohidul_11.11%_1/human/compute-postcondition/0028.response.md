Output State: **n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, l is 0, r is n - 1, st is 0, end is 0, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 inputs.**

The code snippet provided reads an integer `n` from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. It then reads a list of `n` integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `a`. The variables `l` and `r` are initialized to 0 and `n - 1` respectively. The variables `st` and `end` are initialized to 0.

The code does not modify the values of `_` or the contents of `stdin`. The values of `l`, `r`, `st`, and `end` are updated as specified in the code. The value of `n` is updated to the integer read from the input. The value of `a` is updated to the list of integers read from the input.

Note that the code does not modify the value of `_` or the contents of `stdin`, so these values remain the same as in the initial state.
