To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to consider the conditions in the `while` loop statement: `l < r` and `a[l] == a[l + 1]`.

1. **Condition `l < r`:** At the end of the previous iteration, `l` is 2 and `r` is `n - 1`. For this condition to hold true again, `l` must be less than `r`. Since `l` is 2, `r` must be greater than 2. Given that `r` is `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 3 to ensure `r` is at least 3, thus satisfying `l < r`.

2. **Condition `a[l] == a[l + 1]`:** At the end of the previous iteration, `a[l]` (where `l` is 2) is equal to `a[l + 1]` (which is `a[3]`). For this condition to hold true again, considering `l` will increment, we need `a[3]` to be equal to `a[4]`. Since the first three elements are equal, we need at least one more element to be equal to the first three for this condition to potentially hold true in the next iteration.

Given these considerations, the state adjustments are focused on ensuring `n` is large enough to satisfy both conditions and acknowledging the requirement for additional equal elements in `a`.

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first four elements are equal, `l` is 2, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is 2, `end` is 0, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1 input**
