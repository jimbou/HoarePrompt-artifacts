Output State: **n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, l is the index of the first element in a that is not equal to the first element in a, r is n-1, st is the number of elements in a that are equal to the first element in a, end is 0, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 inputs.**

This output state means that the loop has finished executing when it has found the first pair of adjacent elements in the list `a` that are not equal. The variable `l` points to the first element of this pair, and the variable `st` counts the number of elements before this pair that are equal to the first element of the list. The other variables remain unchanged.
