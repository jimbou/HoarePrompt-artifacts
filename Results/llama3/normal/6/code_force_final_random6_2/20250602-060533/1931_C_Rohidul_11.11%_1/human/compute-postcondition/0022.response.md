Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is less than `n`, `r` is equal to `l`, `st` is the number of elements in `a` that are equal to the first element in `a`, `end` is equal to `n - l - 1`, `_` is 0, `ans` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1 input. The first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a`. Either `st` is not equal to 0, or `end` is not equal to 0, or the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` is calculated as `r - l`, which is equal to `l - l` since `r` is equal to `l`. Therefore, `ans` is 0. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
