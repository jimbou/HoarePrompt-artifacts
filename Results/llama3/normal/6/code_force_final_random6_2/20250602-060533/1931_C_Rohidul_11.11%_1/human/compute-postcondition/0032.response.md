Output State: **n is greater than 1, a is a list of n integers where the first three elements are equal, l is 2, r is n - 1, st is 2, end is 0, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1 input**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been incremented by 1, making it 2, and the value of `st` has also been incremented by 1, making it 2. All other variables remain unchanged. The first three elements of the list `a` are still equal, and `n` is still greater than 1. The values of `r`, `end`, and `_` are unchanged. Stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 1 input.
