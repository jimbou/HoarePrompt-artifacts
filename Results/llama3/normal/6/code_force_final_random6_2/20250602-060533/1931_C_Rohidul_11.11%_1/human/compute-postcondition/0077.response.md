Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where at least the last (`n - k`) elements are equal, `l` is `k`, `r` is `l`, `st` is `k`, `end` is `n - k`, `ans` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 inputs. The first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a`. Either `st` is not equal to 0 or `end` is not equal to 0 or the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of elements `n` is still greater than 1, and the list `a` still has `n` integers with at least the last (`n - k`) elements being equal. The variables `l`, `r`, `st`, and `end` retain their original values. A new variable `ans` is introduced and assigned the value 0, which is the difference between `r` and `l`. The input stream still contains multiple test cases with 2 inputs each. The conditions regarding the first and last elements of `a` and the values of `st` and `end` remain unchanged.
