Output State: **n is greater than 1, a is a list of n integers where the first l + 1 elements are equal and the last two elements are equal, l is the number of consecutive equal elements at the start of a, r is n - 2, st is the number of consecutive equal elements at the start of a, end is 1, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1 input**

In this output state, the value of `r` has been decremented by 1, making it `n - 2`, and the value of `end` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` still contains `n` integers with the first `l + 1` elements equal and the last two elements equal. The number of consecutive equal elements at the start of `a`, represented by `l` and `st`, remains the same. The value of `_` is still 1, and `stdin` still contains multiple test cases with 1 input.
