This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a list of n integers. It then processes each test case by finding the longest contiguous subarray with distinct elements, excluding the first and last elements if they are equal. The function prints the maximum length of such a subarray for each test case, or 0 if no such subarray exists.
