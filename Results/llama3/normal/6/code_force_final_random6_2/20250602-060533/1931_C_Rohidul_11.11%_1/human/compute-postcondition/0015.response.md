Output State: **n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, l is less than n, r is equal to l, st is the number of elements in a that are equal to the first element in a, end is equal to n - l - 1, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1 input.**

The loop will continue to execute until r is no longer greater than l and a[r] is not equal to a[r - 1]. At this point, r will be equal to l, and end will be equal to the number of elements in a that are equal to the first element in a, minus 1. The other variables in the initial state will remain unchanged.
