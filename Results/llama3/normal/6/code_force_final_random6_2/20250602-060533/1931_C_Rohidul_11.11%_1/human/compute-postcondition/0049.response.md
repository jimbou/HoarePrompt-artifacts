Output State: **`n` is greater than `l` + 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first `l` + 1 elements are equal and the last `end` + 1 elements are equal, `l` is the number of consecutive equal elements at the start of `a`, `r` is `l`, `st` is the number of consecutive equal elements at the start of `a`, `end` is `n` - `l` - 1, `_` is 1, `ans` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1 input. The first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a`. At least one of the following conditions is true: `st` is not equal to 0, `end` is not equal to 0, or the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `a` has `n` integers, with the first `l` + 1 elements being equal and the last `end` + 1 elements being equal. The variables `l`, `r`, and `st` are all equal to the number of consecutive equal elements at the start of `a`. The variable `end` is equal to `n` - `l` - 1. The variable `_` is still 1. A new variable `ans` is introduced and is equal to 0, which is the difference between `r` and `l`. The input in stdin has been reduced by one test case. The conditions that at least one of `st` is not equal to 0, `end` is not equal to 0, or the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a` still hold true.
