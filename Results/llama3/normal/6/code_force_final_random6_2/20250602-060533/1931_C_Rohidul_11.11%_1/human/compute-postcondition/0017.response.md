Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is less than `n`, `r` is equal to `l`, `st` is the number of elements in `a` that are equal to the first element in `a`, `end` is equal to `n - l - 1`, `_` is 0, `ans` is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1 input. The first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been calculated as `r - l - 1`, which is equal to `-1` since `r` is equal to `l`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one input. The first element of `a` is still equal to the last element of `a`.
