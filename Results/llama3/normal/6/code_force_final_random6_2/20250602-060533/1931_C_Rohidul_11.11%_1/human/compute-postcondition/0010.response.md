Output State: **n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, l is less than n-2, r is n-2, st is the number of elements in a that are equal to the first element in a, end is 1, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1 input**

In this output state, the value of `r` has been decremented by 1, making it `n-2`. The value of `end` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. The value of `l` is still less than `n-1`, but since `r` is now `n-2`, `l` is also less than `n-2`. The values of `n`, `a`, `st`, and `_` remain unchanged. The number of inputs in `stdin` has been reduced by 1.
