The only variable in the loop head is variable _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than the number of test cases, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 1, the number of test cases is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again _ must be 2.
State: **n is greater than l + 1, a is a list of n integers where the first l + 1 elements are equal and the last end + 1 elements are equal, l is the number of consecutive equal elements at the start of a, r is l, st is the number of consecutive equal elements at the start of a, end is n - l - 1, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 inputs. If the first element of a is equal to the last element of a, then ans is 0. If the first element of a is not equal to the last element of a, then if st is 0 and end is 0, ans is n - 1. Otherwise, ans is 0. The maximum of 0 and ans is being printed.**
