The code snippet increments `l` by 1 and `st` by 1. Since `l` was 0, it becomes 1. Similarly, since `st` was 0, it becomes 1. No other variables are affected by the code. The value of `n` remains an integer greater than 1, `a` remains a list of `n` integers with the first two elements being equal, `r` remains `n-1`, `end` remains 0, and `_` remains 0. Stdin still contains multiple test cases - 2 inputs.

Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers where the first two elements are equal, l is 1, r is n-1, st is 1, end is 0, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 inputs**
