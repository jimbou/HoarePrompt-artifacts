Postcondition: ***n is greater than l + 1, a is a list of n integers where the first l + 1 elements are equal and the last end + 1 elements are equal, l is the number of consecutive equal elements at the start of a, r is l, st is the number of consecutive equal elements at the start of a, end is n - l - 1, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1 input. The first element of a is not equal to the last element of a. If st is 0 and end is 0, ans is n - 1. Otherwise, ans is 0.***
