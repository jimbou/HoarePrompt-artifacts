Based on the initial state, we can analyze the code as follows:

* `n` is greater than `l + 1`, which means the list `a` has more than `l + 1` elements.
* The first `l + 1` elements of `a` are equal, and the last `end + 1` elements are equal.
* `l` is the number of consecutive equal elements at the start of `a`, and `r` is also equal to `l`.
* `st` is the number of consecutive equal elements at the start of `a`, which is equal to `l`.
* `end` is `n - l - 1`, which means the number of elements at the end of `a` that are equal.
* `_` is 1, but it's not used in the code.
* `stdin` contains multiple test cases, but it's not relevant to the print statement.

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

* `ans` is calculated based on the conditions:
	+ If the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, then `ans` is 0.
	+ If the first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a`, then:
		- If `st` is 0 and `end` is 0, then `ans` is `n - 1`.
		- Otherwise, `ans` is 0.

Since `st` is equal to `l`, and `l` is greater than 0 (because `n` is greater than `l + 1`), `st` is not 0. Therefore, the condition `st` is 0 and `end` is 0 is not met.

Now, let's consider the two possible cases:

1. If the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, then `ans` is 0.
2. If the first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a`, then `ans` is 0 (because `st` is not 0).

In both cases, `ans` is 0. Therefore, the print statement will print:

Output: **0**
