Output State: **n is greater than 0, a is a list of n integers where at least the last (n - k) elements are equal, l is k, r is l, st is k, end is n - k, _ is equal to the number of test cases in stdin, stdin contains no inputs. If the first element of a is equal to the last element of a, then ans is -1. If the first element of a is not equal to the last element of a, then if st is 0, end is 0, ans is n - 1, otherwise ans is 0, and the maximum value between 0 and ans is printed, which is 0 if ans is -1 or 0, and n - 1 if ans is n - 1**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has processed all the test cases in the input. The variables l, r, st, and end have reached their final values, and the variable _ has reached the total number of test cases. The list a has been processed to find the maximum number of consecutive equal elements at the start and end of the list. The variable ans has been calculated based on the values of st, end, and the first and last elements of a. The maximum value between 0 and ans is printed as the final output.
