Postcondition: **n is greater than 1, a is a list of n integers where at least the last (n - k) elements are equal, l is k, r is l, st is 0, end is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 inputs. The first element of a is not equal to the last element of a, and the current value of st is 0, the current value of end is 0, and the first element of a is not equal to the last element of a.**
