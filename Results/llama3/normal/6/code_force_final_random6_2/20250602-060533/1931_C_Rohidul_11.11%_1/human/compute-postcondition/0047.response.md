Output State: **`n` is greater than `l` + 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first `l` + 1 elements are equal and the last `end` + 1 elements are equal, `l` is the number of consecutive equal elements at the start of `a`, `r` is `l`, `st` is 0, `end` is 0, `_` is 1, `ans` is `n` - 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1 input. The first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `a` has `n` elements, where the first `l` + 1 elements are equal and the last `end` + 1 elements are equal. The number of consecutive equal elements at the start of `a` is `l`, and the number of consecutive equal elements at the end of `a` is `end`. The variable `st` is 0, and the variable `end` is also 0. The variable `_` is 1. The variable `ans` is now equal to `n` - 1. The first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a`. The stdin contains multiple test cases, but one input has been processed.
