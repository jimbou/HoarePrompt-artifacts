Output State: **n is greater than 1, a is a list of n integers where the first l + 1 elements are equal, l is the number of consecutive equal elements at the start of a, r is n - 1, st is the number of consecutive equal elements at the start of a, end is 0, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1 input.**

This output state means that after the loop has finished executing, the value of `l` will be equal to the number of consecutive equal elements at the start of the list `a`. The value of `st` will also be equal to the number of consecutive equal elements at the start of the list `a`. The values of `r`, `end`, and `_` remain unchanged, and `n` is still greater than 1. The list `a` still contains `n` integers, but now we know that the first `l + 1` elements are equal.
