Output State: **n is greater than 1, a is a list of n integers where at least the last two elements are equal, l is k, r is n - 2, st is k, end is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 inputs.**

The code modifies the values of `r` and `end`. The first line decrements `r` by 1, changing its value from `n - 1` to `n - 2`. The second line increments `end` by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. No other variables are affected. The initial state's conditions regarding `n`, `a`, `l`, `st`, and stdin remain valid as they are not modified by the code.
