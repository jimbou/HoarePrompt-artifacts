Output State: **n is greater than l + 2, a is a list of n integers where the first l + 1 elements are equal and the last two elements are equal, l is the number of consecutive equal elements at the start of a, r is greater than l and less than or equal to n - 3, st is the number of consecutive equal elements at the start of a, end is 3, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1 input**

In this final state, the value of `r` has been decremented by 1, and the value of `end` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
