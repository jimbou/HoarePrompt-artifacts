Output State: **`n` is greater than `l + 1`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first `l + 1` elements are equal and the last `end + 1` elements are equal, `l` is the number of consecutive equal elements at the start of `a`, `r` is `l`, `st` is the number of consecutive equal elements at the start of `a`, `end` is `n - l - 1`, `_` is 1, `ans` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1 input. The first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` is calculated as `r - l - 1`, which is equal to `l - l - 1` since `r` is equal to `l`. Therefore, `ans` is 0. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
