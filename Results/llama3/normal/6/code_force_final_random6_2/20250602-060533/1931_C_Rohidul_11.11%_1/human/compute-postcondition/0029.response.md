To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `l`, `r`, and `a`.

According to the loop condition, `l < r` and `a[l] == a[l + 1]` must be true for the loop to execute. 

Right before the loop, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, and `a` is a list of `n` integers. Since `n` is an integer, `r` being `n - 1` does not guarantee that `l < r` will be true. Therefore, `n` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 1.

Additionally, since `a` is a list of `n` integers, we need to ensure that `a[l] == a[l + 1]` is true. This means that the first two elements of `a` must be equal.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first two elements are equal, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is 0, `end` is 0, `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 inputs**
