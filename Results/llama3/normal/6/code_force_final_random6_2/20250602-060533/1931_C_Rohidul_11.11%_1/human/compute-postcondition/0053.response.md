Output: *n is greater than l + 1, a is a list of n integers where the first l + 1 elements are equal and the last end + 1 elements are equal, l is the number of consecutive equal elements at the start of a, r is l, st is the number of consecutive equal elements at the start of a, end is n - l - 1, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1 input. If the first element of a is equal to the last element of a, then ans is 0. If the first element of a is not equal to the last element of a, then if st is 0 and end is 0, ans is n - 1. Otherwise, ans is 0. The maximum of 0 and ans is printed, which is either 0 or n - 1 depending on the values of st, end, and the first and last elements of a.
