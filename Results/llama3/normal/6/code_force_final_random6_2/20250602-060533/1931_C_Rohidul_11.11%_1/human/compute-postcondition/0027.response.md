The only variable in the loop head is variable _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than the number of test cases, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1 input. So for the loop to be executed one more time the variable _ is 1 and stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 inputs.
State: **n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, l is less than n, r is equal to l, st is the number of elements in a that are equal to the first element in a, end is equal to n - l - 1, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 inputs. If the first element of a is equal to the last element of a, then ans is -1. If the first element of a is not equal to the last element of a, then if st is 0, end is 0, ans is n-1. Otherwise, ans is 0. and the maximum value between 0 and ans is printed**
