The code prints the maximum value between 0 and `ans`. 

`ans` is determined by the following conditions:

- If the first element of list `a` is equal to the last element of list `a`, then `ans` is -1.
- If the first element of list `a` is not equal to the last element of list `a`, then:
  - If `st` is 0 and `end` is 0, `ans` is `n - 1`.
  - Otherwise, `ans` is 0.

Since `st` is equal to `k` and `end` is equal to `n - k`, and at least the last `(n - k)` elements of list `a` are equal, it is possible that the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`. 

However, without knowing the exact values of `n`, `k`, and the elements of list `a`, we cannot determine the exact value of `ans`. 

Therefore, the print statement will output the maximum value between 0 and `ans`, which can be either 0 or `n - 1`, depending on the conditions described above.

Output: **0 or n - 1 (where n is the number of elements in list a)**
