Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is less than `n`, `r` is equal to `l`, `st` is 0, `end` is 0, `_` is 0, `ans` is `n-1`, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1 input. The first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is now set to `n-1`, which is the length of the list `a` minus 1. All other variables remain unchanged, including `n`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `st`, `end`, and `_`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but one input has been consumed. The first element of `a` is still not equal to the last element of `a`.
