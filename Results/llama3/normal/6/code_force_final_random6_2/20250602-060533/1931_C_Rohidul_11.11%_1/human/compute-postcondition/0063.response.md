Output State: **n is greater than 1, a is a list of n integers where the first k elements are equal, l is k, r is n - 1, st is k, end is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 inputs.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: the number of elements in the list 'a' is greater than 1, the first 'k' elements of 'a' are equal, the left pointer 'l' is at index 'k', the right pointer 'r' is at the last index of 'a', the counter 'st' is equal to 'k', and 'end' is still 0. The state of the input stream 'stdin' remains unchanged, containing multiple test cases with 2 inputs each.
