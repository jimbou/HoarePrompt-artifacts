The variables in the loop head are r and l and a, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables r, l and a. If r is greater than l and a[r] is equal to a[r - 1], the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, r is n-3, l is less than n-3, and a[r] is equal to a[r - 1]. For the loop to execute again, r must be greater than l and a[r] must be equal to a[r - 1]. Since r is n-3 and l is less than n-3, r is already greater than l. However, a[r] being equal to a[r - 1] does not ensure that a[r] will be equal to a[r - 1] in the next iteration, so a[r] and a[r - 1] need to be adjusted to a[r] is equal to a[r - 1] and a[r - 2] is equal to a[r - 1]. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n is an integer, a is a list of n integers where the last three elements are equal, l is less than n-3, r is n-3, st is the number of elements in a that are equal to the first element in a, end is 2, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1 input**
