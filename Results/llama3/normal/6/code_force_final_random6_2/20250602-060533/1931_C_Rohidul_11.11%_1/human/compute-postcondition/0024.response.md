Postcondition: ***n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, l is less than n, r is equal to l, st is the number of elements in a that are equal to the first element in a, end is equal to n - l - 1, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1 input. If the first element of a is equal to the last element of a, then ans is -1. If the first element of a is not equal to the last element of a, then if st is 0, end is 0, ans is n-1. Otherwise, ans is 0.***
