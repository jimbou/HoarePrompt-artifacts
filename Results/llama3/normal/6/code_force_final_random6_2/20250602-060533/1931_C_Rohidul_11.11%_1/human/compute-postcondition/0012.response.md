Output State: **n is an integer, a is a list of n integers where the last two elements are equal, l is less than n-3, r is n-3, st is the number of elements in a that are equal to the first element in a, end is 2, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1 input**

The code modifies the values of `r` and `end`. The first line decrements `r` by 1, making it `n-3`. The second line increments `end` by 1, making it 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
