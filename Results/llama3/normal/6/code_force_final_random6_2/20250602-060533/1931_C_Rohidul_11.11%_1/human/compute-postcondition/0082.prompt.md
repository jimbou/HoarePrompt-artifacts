Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and then a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    st, end = 0, 0
    while l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]:
        l += 1
        st += 1
    while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
        r -= 1
        end += 1
    if a[0] == a[-1]:
        ans = r - l - 1
    elif st == 0 and end == 0 and a[0] != a[-1]:
        ans = len(a) - 1
    else:
        ans = r - l
    print(max(0, ans))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, l is less than n, r is equal to l, st is the number of elements in a that are equal to the first element in a, end is equal to n - l - 1, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1 input. If the first element of a is equal to the last element of a, then ans is -1. If the first element of a is not equal to the last element of a, then if st is 0, end is 0, ans is n-1. Otherwise, ans is 0. and the maximum value between 0 and ans is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is greater than l + 1, a is a list of n integers where the first l + 1 elements are equal and the last end + 1 elements are equal, l is the number of consecutive equal elements at the start of a, r is l, st is the number of consecutive equal elements at the start of a, end is n - l - 1, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1 input. If the first element of a is equal to the last element of a, then ans is 0. If the first element of a is not equal to the last element of a, then if st is 0 and end is 0, ans is n - 1. Otherwise, ans is 0. The maximum of 0 and ans is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is greater than 1, a is a list of n integers where at least the last (n - k) elements are equal, l is k, r is l, st is k, end is n - k, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 inputs. If the first element of a is equal to the last element of a, then ans is -1. If the first element of a is not equal to the last element of a, then if st is 0, end is 0, ans is n - 1, otherwise ans is 0, and the maximum value between 0 and ans is printed, which is 0 if ans is -1 or 0, and n - 1 if ans is n - 1




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
