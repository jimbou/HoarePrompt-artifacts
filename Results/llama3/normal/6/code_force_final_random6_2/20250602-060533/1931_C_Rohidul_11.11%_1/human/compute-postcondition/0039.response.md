Output State: **n is greater than l + 2, a is a list of n integers where the first l + 1 elements are equal and the last two elements are equal, l is the number of consecutive equal elements at the start of a, r is greater than or equal to l and less than or equal to n - 2, st is the number of consecutive equal elements at the start of a, end is 2, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1 input**

The code snippet modifies the values of `r` and `end`. The first line decrements `r` by 1, making it greater than or equal to `l` and less than or equal to `n - 2`. The second line increments `end` by 1, making it equal to 2. The values of `n`, `a`, `l`, `st`, and `_` remain unchanged. Stdin still contains multiple test cases - 1 input.
