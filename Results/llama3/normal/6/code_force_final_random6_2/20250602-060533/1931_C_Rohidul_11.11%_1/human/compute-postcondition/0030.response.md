Output State: **n is greater than 1, a is a list of n integers where the first two elements are equal, l is 1, r is n - 1, st is 1, end is 0, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1 input**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been incremented by 1, making it 1, and the value of `st` has also been incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first two elements are equal, `r` is `n - 1`, `end` is 0, and `_` is 1 still holds true. Additionally, stdin now contains one less input, as one input has been processed.
