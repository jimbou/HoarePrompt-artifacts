Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where at least the last (`n` - `k`) elements are equal, `l` is `k`, `r` is `l`, `st` is `k`, `end` is `n` - `k`, `ans` is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 inputs. The first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is calculated as `r` - `l` - 1, where `r` is equal to `l`. Since `r` is equal to `l`, the value of `ans` is -1. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` still has at least the last (`n` - `k`) elements equal, and the first element of `a` is still equal to the last element of `a`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases with 2 inputs.
