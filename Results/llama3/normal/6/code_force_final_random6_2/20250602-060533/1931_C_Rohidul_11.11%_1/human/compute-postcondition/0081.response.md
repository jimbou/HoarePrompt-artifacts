Output: **n is greater than 1, a is a list of n integers where at least the last (n - k) elements are equal, l is k, r is l, st is k, end is n - k, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 inputs. If the first element of a is equal to the last element of a, then ans is -1. If the first element of a is not equal to the last element of a, then if st is 0, end is 0, ans is n - 1, otherwise ans is 0, and the maximum value between 0 and ans is printed, which is 0 if ans is -1 or 0, and n - 1 if ans is n - 1**
