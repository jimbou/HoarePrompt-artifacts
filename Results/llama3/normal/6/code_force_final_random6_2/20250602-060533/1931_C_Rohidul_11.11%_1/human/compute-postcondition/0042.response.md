Output State: **n is greater than l + 1, a is a list of n integers where the first l + 1 elements are equal and the last end + 1 elements are equal, l is the number of consecutive equal elements at the start of a, r is l, st is the number of consecutive equal elements at the start of a, end is n - l - 1, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1 input**

This output state means that after the loop finishes executing, the list `a` will have `l + 1` equal elements at the start and `end + 1` equal elements at the end, with `r` being equal to `l`. The value of `end` will be `n - l - 1`, indicating that the loop has iterated `n - l - 1` times. The other variables, `st` and `_`, remain unchanged.
