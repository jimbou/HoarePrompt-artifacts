Output State: **n is an integer greater than 3, a is a list of n integers where the first three elements are equal, l is 3, r is n-1, st is 3, end is 0, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 inputs**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been incremented by 1, making it 3. The value of `st` has also been incremented by 1, making it 3. All other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` still contains `n` integers, with the first three elements being equal. The values of `r`, `end`, and `_` are still the same. The `stdin` still contains multiple test cases with 2 inputs.
