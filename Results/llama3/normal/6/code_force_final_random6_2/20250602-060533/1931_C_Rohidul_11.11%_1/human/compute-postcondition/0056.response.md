Output State: **n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, l is 0, r is n - 1, st is 0, end is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 inputs**

The code snippet reads an integer value from stdin and assigns it to `n`, making `n` an integer. Then, it reads a list of `n` integers from stdin and assigns it to `a`. The variables `l`, `r`, `st`, and `end` are initialized to 0, but their values are not affected by the code. The value of `_` is not modified by the code and remains 2. The stdin now contains multiple test cases - 2 inputs.
