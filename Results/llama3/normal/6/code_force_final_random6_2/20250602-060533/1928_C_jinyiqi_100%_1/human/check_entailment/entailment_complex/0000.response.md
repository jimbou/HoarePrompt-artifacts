Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of different k values that fit under the given constraints. The program takes two integers as input, n and x, representing Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the settling, respectively.

The program first checks if (n + x - 2) and (n - x) are even numbers. If they are, it calls the function func_1 to find the divisors of these numbers. The function func_1 calculates the divisors of a given number that are less than or equal to its square root, along with their corresponding quotient values. It returns a combined list of these quotient values and divisors, with the divisors in reverse order.

The program then filters the divisors to include only those that are greater than or equal to x and are even numbers. It stores these divisors in the output list.

Finally, the program removes duplicates from the output list by converting it to a set and then back to a list. It prints the length of the output list, which represents the number of different k values that fit under the given constraints.

Based on the provided problem description and the execution states of the program, the program correctly implements the logic to find the number of different k values that fit under the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
