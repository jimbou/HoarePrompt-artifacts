This function takes a list of two integers as input, where the first integer is greater than or equal to the second integer and the second integer is greater than 1. It calculates the divisors of the first integer that are less than or equal to its square root, along with their corresponding quotient values. The function returns a combined list of these quotient values and divisors, with the divisors in reverse order.
