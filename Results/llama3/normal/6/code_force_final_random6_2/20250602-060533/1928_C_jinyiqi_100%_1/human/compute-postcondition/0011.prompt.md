Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: x is a list of two integers, where the first integer is greater than or equal to the second integer and the second integer is greater than 1, output1 is an empty list, output2 is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
    if x % i == 0:
        output1.append(i)
        output2.append(int(x / i))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`x` is a list of two integers, where the first integer is greater than or equal to 2 and the second integer is greater than 1, `output1` is a list containing the integer 1 if `x` is divisible by `i`, otherwise it remains an empty list, `output2` is a list containing the integer value of `x` if `x` is divisible by `i`, otherwise it remains an empty list, `i` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `x` is a list of two integers, where the first integer is greater than or equal to 4 and the second integer is greater than 1, `i` is 2. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `output1` is a list containing the integers 1 and 2, and `output2` is a list containing the integer value of `x` divided by 2. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, then `output1` and `output2` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`x` is a list of two integers, where the first integer is greater than or equal to 4 and the second integer is greater than 1, `i` is 3, `output1` is a list containing the integers 1 and 2, and `output2` is a list containing the integer value of `x` divided by 2. If `x` is divisible by `i`, `output1` is updated to contain the integers 1, 2, and 3, and `output2` is updated to contain the integer value of `x` divided by 2 and the integer value of `x` divided by 3. Otherwise, the values of `output1` and `output2` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
