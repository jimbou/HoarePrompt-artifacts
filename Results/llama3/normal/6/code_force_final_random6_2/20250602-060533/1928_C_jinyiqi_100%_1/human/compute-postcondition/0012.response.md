Output State: **`x` is a list of two integers, where the first integer is greater than or equal to the second integer and the second integer is greater than 1, `output1` is a list containing all the divisors of the first integer in `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of the first integer in `x` in reverse order, `output2` is a list containing the corresponding quotient values for each divisor in `output1`.**

In this output state, the list `output1` has been reversed, meaning that the order of its elements has been changed. The first element of `output1` is now the last element it had before the code was executed, the second element is now the second to last, and so on. The other variables, `x` and `output2`, remain unchanged.
