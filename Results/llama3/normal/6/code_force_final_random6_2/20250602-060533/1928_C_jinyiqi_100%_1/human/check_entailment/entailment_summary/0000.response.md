Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of different k values that fit under the given constraints. The program takes two integers as input, n and x, representing Vasya's position in the line and the number he received during the settling, respectively.

The program first checks if (n + x - 2) is divisible by 2, and if so, it calculates the divisors of (n + x - 2) using the func_1 function. It then filters these divisors to include only those that are greater than or equal to x and have a corresponding k value that is greater than 1.

Similarly, the program checks if (n - x) is divisible by 2, and if so, it calculates the divisors of (n - x) using the func_1 function. It then filters these divisors to include only those that are greater than or equal to x and have a corresponding k value that is greater than 1.

The program combines the filtered divisors from both cases, removes duplicates by converting the list to a set, and finally prints the length of the resulting set, which represents the number of different k values that fit under the given constraints.

Based on the provided execution summary, the func_1 function correctly calculates the divisors of a given number, and the program correctly filters and combines these divisors to find the valid k values.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
