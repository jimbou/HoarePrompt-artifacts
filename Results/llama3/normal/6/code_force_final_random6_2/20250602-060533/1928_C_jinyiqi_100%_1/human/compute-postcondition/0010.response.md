Postcondition: ***`x` is a list of two integers, where the first integer is greater than or equal to 4 and the second integer is greater than 1, `i` is 3, `output1` is a list containing the integers 1 and 2, and `output2` is a list containing the integer value of `x` divided by 2. If `x` is divisible by `i`, `output1` is updated to contain the integers 1, 2, and 3, and `output2` is updated to contain the integer value of `x` divided by 2 and the integer value of `x` divided by 3. Otherwise, the values of `output1` and `output2` remain unchanged.***
