To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` is greater than 1. Since `x` is a list of two integers, we need to consider the first element of `x` (let's call it `x[0]`) to satisfy this condition.

The condition `int(x ** 0.5) + 1 > 1` implies that `x[0]` must be greater than or equal to 2, since `int(x ** 0.5)` would be at least 1, and adding 1 would make it greater than 1.

Additionally, since `i` starts from 1, we can set `i` to 1.

The states of `output1` and `output2` are not affected by the loop head, so we don't need to adjust them.

State: **`x` is a list of two integers, where the first integer is greater than or equal to 2 and the second integer is greater than 1, `output1` is an empty list, `output2` is an empty list, `i` is 1**
