To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x` plus 1. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `x` is a list of two integers, where the first integer is greater than or equal to 4 and the second integer is greater than 1.

To determine the next value of `i`, we need to increment it by 1, so `i` becomes 3.

The state of `x` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`x` is a list of two integers, where the first integer is greater than or equal to 4 and the second integer is greater than 1, `i` is 3, `output1` is a list containing the integers 1 and 2, and `output2` is a list containing the integer value of `x` divided by 2**
