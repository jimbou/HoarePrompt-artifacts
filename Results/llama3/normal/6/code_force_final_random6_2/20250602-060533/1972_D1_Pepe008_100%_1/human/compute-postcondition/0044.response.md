Output State: **`T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer in the input, `b` is an integer greater than 2 and equal to the second integer in the input, `x` is ((a - t * (t - 1)) // t^2 + 1), `suma` is increased by `x`**

In this output state, the values of `T`, `t`, `a`, `b`, and `x` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that the value of `suma` is increased by the value of `x`, which is calculated based on the values of `a` and `t`.
