To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `b`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `b` is at least 1. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `b` to be greater than 0.

State: **T is greater than 0, t is 0, a is an integer, b is greater than 0, suma is 0, stdin contains at least one test case minus one input, i is 1**
