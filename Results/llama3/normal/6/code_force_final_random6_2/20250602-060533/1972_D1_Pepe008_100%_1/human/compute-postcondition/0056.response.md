Output State: **`T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer in the input, `b` is at least 1, `suma` is equal to `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i)`, `i` is 1, `x` is equal to `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, and stdin contains the rest of the input.**

In this output state, the value of `suma` has been updated to be equal to `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i)`, which is the current value of `x`. The other variables remain unchanged.
