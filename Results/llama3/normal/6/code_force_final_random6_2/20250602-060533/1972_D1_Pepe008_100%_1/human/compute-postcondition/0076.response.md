Output State: **T is greater than or equal to 0, t is equal to T, a is an integer equal to the first integer in the input, b is an integer equal to the second integer in the input, stdin is empty, suma is equal to the sum of x values calculated in each iteration of the loop, and the value of suma minus 2 is being printed, i is equal to b, and the value of suma minus 2 is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations means that the loop has finished executing for all test cases. The value of `t` is equal to `T`, indicating that the loop has iterated `T` times. The values of `a` and `b` are the last integers read from the input, and `stdin` is empty because all test cases have been processed. The value of `suma` is the sum of all `x` values calculated in each iteration of the loop, and the value of `suma` minus 2 is being printed as the final output. The value of `i` is equal to `b`, indicating that the inner loop has finished executing for the last test case.
