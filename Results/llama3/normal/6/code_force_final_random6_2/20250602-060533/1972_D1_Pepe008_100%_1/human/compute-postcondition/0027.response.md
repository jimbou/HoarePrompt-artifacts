Output State: **T is greater than 1, t is 1, a is an integer equal to the first integer in the input, b is an integer equal to the second integer in the input, suma is 0, stdin is empty**

The code snippet reads two integers from the input, assigns them to `a` and `b`, and resets `suma` to 0. The value of `suma - 2` is not affected by the code and remains being printed. The values of `T` and `t` are not modified by the code and remain the same. Stdin is empty after the code execution.
