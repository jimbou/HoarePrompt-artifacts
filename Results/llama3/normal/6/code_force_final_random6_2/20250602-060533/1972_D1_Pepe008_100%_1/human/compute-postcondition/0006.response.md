Output State: **T is greater than 0, t is 0, a is an integer, b is greater than 0, suma is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i, stdin contains at least one test case minus one input, i is 1, x is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i.**

In natural language, the output state is: T is still greater than 0, t is still 0, a is still an integer, b is still greater than 0, suma has been updated to the value of x which is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i, stdin still contains at least one test case minus one input, i is still 1, and x is still ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i.
