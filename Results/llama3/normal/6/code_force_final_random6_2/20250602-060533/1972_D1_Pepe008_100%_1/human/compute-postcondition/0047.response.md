Postcondition: ***T is greater than 1, t is 1, a is an integer equal to the first integer in the input, b is an integer greater than 2 and equal to the second integer in the input, x is ((a - t * (t - 1)) // t^2 + 1). If (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0, then suma is increased by x. Otherwise, no change is made to suma.***
