Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `x` is equal to `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `T` is still greater than 0, `t` remains 0, `a` is still an integer, `b` is still greater than 1, and `i` is still 1. A new variable `x` is introduced, which is calculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.
