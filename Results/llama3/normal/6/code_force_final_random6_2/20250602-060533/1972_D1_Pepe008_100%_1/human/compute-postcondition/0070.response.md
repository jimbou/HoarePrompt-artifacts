Output State: **`T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer in the input, `b` is greater than or equal to 3, `suma` is `(((a - i * (i - 1)) // i) + 1`, `i` is 3, `x` is equal to `(((a - i * (i - 1)) // i)`**

In natural language, the output state is: T is still greater than 2, t is still 2, a is still an integer equal to the first integer in the input, b is still greater than or equal to 3, suma has been incremented by 1 and is now `(((a - i * (i - 1)) // i) + 1`, i is still 3, and x is still equal to `(((a - i * (i - 1)) // i)`.
