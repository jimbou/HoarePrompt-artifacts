To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `b`. The loop will execute if `b` is at least 1, since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `b + 1`. This means `b` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **T is greater than 1, t is 1, a is an integer equal to the first integer in the input, b is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the second integer in the input, suma is 0, stdin is empty, i is 1**
