Output State: **`T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer in the input, `b` is an integer greater than 2 and equal to the second integer in the input, `x` is ((a - t * (t - 1)) // t^2 + 1), `suma` is increased by `x` and then increased by 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `suma` has been increased by 1 in addition to its previous increase by `x`, which is ((a - t * (t - 1)) // t^2 + 1). The values of `T`, `t`, `a`, `b`, and `x` remain unchanged.
