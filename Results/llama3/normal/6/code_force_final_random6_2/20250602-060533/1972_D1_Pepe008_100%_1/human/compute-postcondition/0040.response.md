Postcondition: ***T is greater than 1, t is 1, a is an integer equal to the first integer in the input, b is an integer greater than 1 and equal to the second integer in the input, x is ((a - 2) // 2). If (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0, then suma is incremented by ((a - 2) // 2) + 1. Otherwise, suma is incremented by ((a - 2) // 2).***
