To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `b`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `b` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `b`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `b` must be greater than 1.

The other variables, `T`, `t`, and `a`, are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is greater than 1, `i` is 1**
