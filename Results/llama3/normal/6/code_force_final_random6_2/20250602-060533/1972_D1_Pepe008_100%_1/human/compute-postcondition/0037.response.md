Output State: **T is greater than 1, t is 1, a is an integer equal to the first integer in the input, b is an integer greater than 1 and equal to the second integer in the input, x is ((a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2 ** 2 + 1), stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: T is still greater than 1, t remains 1, a is still equal to the first integer in the input, b is still an integer greater than 1 and equal to the second integer in the input, and x is now equal to the result of the expression ((a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2 ** 2 + 1). The stdin remains empty.
