Postcondition: **T is greater than 1, t is 1, a is an integer equal to the first integer in the input, b is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the second integer in the input, suma is 0, stdin is empty, i is 1, and the current value of x is (a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1 which is (a - 0) // 1 + 1 which is a + 1, and the value of x is greater than 0.**
