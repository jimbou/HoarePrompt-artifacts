Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `x` is equal to `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, `suma` is equal to `suma + ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i)`**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `T`, `t`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `x` is still equal to the expression `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i`. The value of `suma` is increased by the value of `x`, which is `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i`.
