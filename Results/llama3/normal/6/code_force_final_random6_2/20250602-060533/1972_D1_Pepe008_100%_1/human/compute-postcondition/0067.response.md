To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, b + 1):`. The variables involved are `i` and `b`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `b + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `b` is greater than 2.

To adjust the states for the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1, so `i` becomes 3. Since `b` is greater than 2, it must be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables in the state (`T`, `t`, `a`, `suma`, and `x`) are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer in the input, `b` is greater than or equal to 3, `suma` is 0, `i` is 3, `x` is equal to `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i)`**
