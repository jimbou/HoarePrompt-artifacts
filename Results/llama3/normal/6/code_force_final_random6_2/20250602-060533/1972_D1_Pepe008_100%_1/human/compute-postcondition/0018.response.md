Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `x` is equal to `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2) + 1`**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been updated to `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2) + 1`, which is a new expression that takes into account the previous value of `x` and the values of `i` and `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
