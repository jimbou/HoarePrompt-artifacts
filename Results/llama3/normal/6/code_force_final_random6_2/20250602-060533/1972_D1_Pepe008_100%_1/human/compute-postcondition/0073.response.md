Output State: **T is greater than 2, t is 2, a is an integer equal to the first integer in the input, b is an integer equal to the second integer in the input, stdin is empty, suma is equal to the sum of x values calculated in each iteration of the loop, and the value of suma minus 2 is being printed, i is equal to b.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `suma` is the sum of all the `x` values calculated in each iteration of the loop, and the value of `i` is equal to `b`. The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged.
