Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer in the input, `b` is at least 1, `suma` is 0, `i` is 1, `x` is equal to `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`. If `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0` and `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i != 0`, then the program continues with the rest of the input in stdin. Otherwise, the program does nothing.***
