The only variable in the loop head is variable `t` and `T`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. If `T` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `T` is a positive integer does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `T` is greater than 0 and `t` is now 0. Also, since stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, it should contain at least one test case for the loop to execute.
State: **`T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, stdin contains at least one test case**
