To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved in it.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, b + 1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `b`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `b` is greater than 1.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `b + 1`. Since `i` is 1, we need to increment it by 1 to make it 2. Now, `i` is 2.

The state of `b` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

The other variables, `T`, `t`, `a`, and `x`, are not involved in the loop head, so their states remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `x` is equal to `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`**
