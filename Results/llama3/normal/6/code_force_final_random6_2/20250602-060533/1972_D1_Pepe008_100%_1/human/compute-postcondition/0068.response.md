Output State: **`T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer in the input, `b` is greater than or equal to 3, `suma` is 0, `i` is 3, `x` is equal to `(((a - i * (i - 1)) // i) ** 2 + 1)`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `T` remains greater than 2, `t` remains 2, `a` remains an integer equal to the first integer in the input, `b` remains greater than or equal to 3, `suma` remains 0, `i` remains 3, and `x` is now equal to the square of its previous value plus 1.
