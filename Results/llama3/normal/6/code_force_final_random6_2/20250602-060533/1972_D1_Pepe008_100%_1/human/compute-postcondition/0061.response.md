According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `b`. If `i` is less than `b + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `b` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `b` must be greater than 2.

State: **`T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer in the input, `b` is greater than 2, `suma` is 0, `i` is 2, `x` is equal to `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`**
