Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer in the input, `b` is at least 1, `x` is equal to `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, and stdin contains the rest of the input. If `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0`, then `suma` is equal to `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i) + 1` and `i` is 1. Otherwise, `suma` remains equal to `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i)` and `i` is 1.***
