Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `x` is equal to `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, `suma` is equal to `suma + x + 1`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `suma` is incremented by 1, while the values of other variables remain unchanged. The new value of `suma` is the previous value of `suma` (which was `suma + x`) plus 1. The other variables retain their initial values: `T` is still greater than 0, `t` is still 0, `a` is still an integer, `b` is still greater than 1, `i` is still 1, and `x` is still equal to `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`.
