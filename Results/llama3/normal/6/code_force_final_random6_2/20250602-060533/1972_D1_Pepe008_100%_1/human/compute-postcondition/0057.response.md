Postcondition: **`T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer in the input, `b` is at least 1, `suma` is equal to `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i)`, `i` is 1, `x` is equal to `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, and stdin contains the rest of the input. Additionally, the current value of `((a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2)` is 0 and the current value of `(i * (i - 1) % i ** 2)` is 0.**
