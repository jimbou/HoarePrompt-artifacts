Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer in the input, `b` is greater than 2, `i` is 2. If `(a - i * (i - 1))` is divisible by `i ** 2` and `i * (i - 1)` is divisible by `i ** 2`, then `suma` is equal to `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i) + 1` and `x` is equal to `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i)`. Otherwise, `suma` and `x` remain unchanged.***
