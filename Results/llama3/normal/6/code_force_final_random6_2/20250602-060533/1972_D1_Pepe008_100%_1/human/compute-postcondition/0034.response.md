Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer in the input, `b` is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the second integer in the input, `suma` is `a + 1` or `a + 2`, `i` is 1, `x` is `a + 1`, and stdin is empty. Additionally, if `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0`, then `suma` is `a + 2`.***
