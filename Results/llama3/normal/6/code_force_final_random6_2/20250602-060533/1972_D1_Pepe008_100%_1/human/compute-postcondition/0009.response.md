Postcondition: **T is greater than 0, t is 0, a is an integer, b is greater than 0, if ((a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0), then suma is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i + 1, otherwise suma is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i, stdin contains at least one test case minus one input, i is 1, x is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i.**
