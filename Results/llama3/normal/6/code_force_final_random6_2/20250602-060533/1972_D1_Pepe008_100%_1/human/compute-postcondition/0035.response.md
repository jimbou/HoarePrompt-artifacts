Postcondition: ***T is greater than 1, t is 1, a is an integer equal to the first integer in the input, b is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the second integer in the input, stdin is empty. If (a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1 > 0, then suma is a + 1 or a + 2, i is 1, and x is a + 1. Otherwise, the values of suma, i, and x remain unchanged.***
