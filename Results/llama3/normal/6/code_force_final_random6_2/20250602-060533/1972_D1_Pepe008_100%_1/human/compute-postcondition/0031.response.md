Output State: **`T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer in the input, `b` is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the second integer in the input, `suma` is `a + 1`, `i` is 1, `x` is `a + 1`, and stdin is empty.**

Explanation: The code `suma += x` increments the value of `suma` by the value of `x`. Since `x` is equal to `a + 1`, which is greater than 0, the new value of `suma` is `a + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
