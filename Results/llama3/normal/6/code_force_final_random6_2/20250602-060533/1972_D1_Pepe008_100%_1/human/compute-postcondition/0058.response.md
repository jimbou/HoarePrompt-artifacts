Output State: **`T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer in the input, `b` is at least 1, `suma` is equal to `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i) + 1`, `i` is 1, `x` is equal to `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, and stdin contains the rest of the input.**

In this output state, the value of `suma` has been incremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The expression `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i)` is still valid for `x`, and `suma` is now equal to this expression plus 1. The input state remains the same, with the rest of the input still available in stdin.
