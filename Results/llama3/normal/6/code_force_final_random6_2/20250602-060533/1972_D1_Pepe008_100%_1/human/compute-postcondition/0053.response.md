To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `b`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `b`. If `b` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `b` is an integer equal to the second integer in the input, but this does not ensure that the loop will execute. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `b` to be at least 1. Additionally, since `i` is the loop variable, we need to set its initial value to 1, as specified in the `range` function.

State: **`T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer in the input, `b` is at least 1, `stdin` is empty, `suma` is 0, the value of `suma` minus 2 is being printed, `i` is 1**
