Postcondition: ***T is greater than 1, t is 1, a is an integer equal to the first integer in the input, b is an integer greater than 1 and equal to the second integer in the input, x is ((a - 2) // 2). If (a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1 > 0, then (a - i * (i - 1)) % i is greater than 0. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
