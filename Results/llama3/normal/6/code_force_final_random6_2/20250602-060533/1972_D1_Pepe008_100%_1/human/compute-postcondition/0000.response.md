Output State: **`T` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains two positive integers n and m, where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.**

In this output state, `T` is assigned the value of the first test case, which is a positive integer. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but one test case has been removed because it was used to assign the value to `T`. The remaining test cases still contain two positive integers `n` and `m`, where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.
