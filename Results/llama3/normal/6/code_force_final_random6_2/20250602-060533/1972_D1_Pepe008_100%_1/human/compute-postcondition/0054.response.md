Output State: **`T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer in the input, `b` is at least 1, `suma` is 0, `i` is 1, `x` is equal to `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` which is `(a - 0) // 1 + 1` which is `a + 1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: `T` is still greater than 2, `t` is still 2, `a` is still an integer equal to the first integer in the input, `b` is still at least 1, `suma` is still 0, `i` is still 1, and a new variable `x` is introduced, which is equal to `a + 1`.
