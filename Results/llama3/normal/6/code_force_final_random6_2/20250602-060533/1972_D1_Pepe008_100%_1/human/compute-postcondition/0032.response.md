Postcondition: **`T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer in the input, `b` is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the second integer in the input, `suma` is `a + 1`, `i` is 1, `x` is `a + 1`, and stdin is empty. Additionally, the current value of `a - i * (i - 1)` is a multiple of `i ** 2` and the current value of `i * (i - 1)` is also a multiple of `i ** 2`.**
