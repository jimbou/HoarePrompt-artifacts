Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer in the input, `b` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `x` is equal to `(((a - i * (i - 1)) // i)`. If `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0`, then `suma` is increased by `x`. Otherwise, `suma` remains 0.***
