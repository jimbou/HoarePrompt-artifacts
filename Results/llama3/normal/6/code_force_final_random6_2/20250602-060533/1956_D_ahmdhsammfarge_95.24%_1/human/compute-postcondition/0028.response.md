Output State: **r is i, l is j, over_sum is sm**

The code snippet assigns the values of `i` and `j` to `r` and `l`, respectively, and assigns the value of `sm` to `over_sum`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `sm` are not modified by the code. The subarray from index `i` to `j` and the square of its length are not affected by the code. The sum of the subarray from index 0 to `i-1` and the subarray from index `j+1` to the end of `lst` are also not affected.
