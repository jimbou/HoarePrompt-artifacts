Output State: **`r` and `l` are the indices of the subarray of `lst` that yields the maximum sum when combined with the square of its length, `over_sum` is this maximum sum, `i` is equal to `len(lst)`, `j` is equal to `len(lst)`, and `sm` is not defined.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variables `r` and `l` will hold the indices of the subarray in `lst` that yields the maximum sum when combined with the square of its length. The variable `over_sum` will hold this maximum sum. The variable `i` will be equal to the length of `lst`, and the variable `j` will also be equal to the length of `lst`. The variable `sm` will not be defined.
