To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `j`, `i`, and `len(lst)`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop condition is `range(i + 1, len(lst))`, which means `j` will take values from `i + 1` to `len(lst) - 1`.
2. For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `len(lst) - 1`, because `j` needs to have at least one value to iterate over.
3. Since `i` is equal to `len(lst)` initially, we need to adjust it to be less than `len(lst) - 1` to ensure the loop executes.

The other variables `r`, `l`, `over_sum`, and `sm` are not part of the loop head, so we cannot adjust their states.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`r` and `l` are the indices of the subarray of `lst` that yields the maximum sum when combined with the square of its length, `over_sum` is this maximum sum, `i` is less than `len(lst) - 1`, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, and `sm` is not defined**
