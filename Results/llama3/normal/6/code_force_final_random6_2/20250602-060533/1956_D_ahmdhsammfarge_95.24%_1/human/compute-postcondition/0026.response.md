The only variable in the loop head is variable `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than `len(lst)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i + 1`, so for the loop to execute again `j` must be `i + 2`.
State: **`r` and `l` are the indices of the subarray of `lst` that yields the maximum sum when combined with the square of its length, `over_sum` is this maximum sum, `j` is `i + 2`**
