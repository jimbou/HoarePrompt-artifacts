Replaces a sublist of a given list with a new list of equal length, where all elements are equal to the length of the sublist. The function accepts a list of integers, two integers `r` and `l` representing the start and end indices of the sublist, and a list of operations `ops`. It appends operations to `ops` based on the minimum value of the sublist and then replaces the sublist with a new list of equal length, where all elements are equal to the length of the sublist. The function returns the modified list.
