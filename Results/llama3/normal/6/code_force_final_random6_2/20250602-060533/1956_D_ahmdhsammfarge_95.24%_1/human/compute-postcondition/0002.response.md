Output State: **`r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l, `lst` is a list of integers, `ops` is a list of lists of integers, and `ops` now contains an additional list `[r + 1, l + 1]`, and the current value of the minimum value of the sublist of `lst` from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) is 0.**

In this output state, the code has appended a new list `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the `ops` list. The values of `r`, `l`, and `lst` remain unchanged. The minimum value of the sublist of `lst` from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) is still 0. The `ops` list now contains an additional list `[r + 1, l + 1]`, which is a new operation that has been added to the list of operations.
