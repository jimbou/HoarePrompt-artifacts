Output State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 2 elements, `r` is either 0 or equal to `i`, `l` is either 0 or equal to `j`, `over_sum` is either the sum of all elements in `lst` or equal to `sm`, `j` is `i + 2`, `sm` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `lst`, the sum of the elements of `lst` after index `j`, and the square of the difference between `j` and `i` plus 1.**

In this output state, the value of `sm` has been updated to include the sum of the first `i` elements of `lst`, the sum of the elements of `lst` after index `j`, and the square of the difference between `j` and `i` plus 1. The values of `r`, `l`, and `over_sum` remain dependent on the comparison between `sm` and `over_sum`, but their exact values are not determined in this code snippet. The value of `j` is still `i + 2`, and the list `lst` remains unchanged.
