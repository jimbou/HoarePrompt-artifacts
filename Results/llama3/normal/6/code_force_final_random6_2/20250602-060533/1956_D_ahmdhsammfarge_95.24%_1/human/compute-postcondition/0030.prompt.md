Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `r` and `l` are the indices of the subarray of `lst` that yields the maximum sum when combined with the square of its length, `over_sum` is this maximum sum, `i` is equal to `len(lst)`, `j` is equal to `len(lst)`, and `sm` is not defined.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):
    sm = sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2
    if sm > over_sum:
        r, l = [i, j]
        over_sum = sm


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`r` and `l` are the indices of the subarray of `lst` that yields the maximum sum when combined with the square of its length, `over_sum` is this maximum sum, `i` is less than `len(lst) - 1`, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, and `sm` is the sum of the subarray of `lst` that excludes the elements from index `i` to `j` (inclusive), plus the square of the length of this subarray. If `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, then `r` is set to `i`, `l` is set to `j`, and `over_sum` is updated to `sm`. Otherwise, the values of `r`, `l`, and `over_sum` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`r` and `l` are the indices of the subarray of `lst` that yields the maximum sum when combined with the square of its length, `over_sum` is this maximum sum. If the sum of the subarray of `lst` that excludes the elements from index `i` to `j` (inclusive), plus the square of the length of this subarray, is greater than `over_sum`, then `r` is set to `i`, `l` is set to `j`, and `over_sum` is updated to this new sum. Otherwise, the values of `r`, `l`, and `over_sum` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`r` and `l` are the indices of the subarray of `lst` that yields the maximum sum when combined with the square of its length, `over_sum` is this maximum sum. If the sum of the subarray from index 0 to `i-1`, the subarray from index `j+1` to the end of `lst`, and the square of the length of the subarray from index `i` to `j` is greater than `over_sum`, then `r` is set to `i`, `l` is set to `j`, and `over_sum` is updated to this sum. Otherwise, `r`, `l`, and `over_sum` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
