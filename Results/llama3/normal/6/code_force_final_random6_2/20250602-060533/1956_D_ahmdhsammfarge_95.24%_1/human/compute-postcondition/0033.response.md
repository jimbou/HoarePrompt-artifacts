Output State: **`r` and `l` are the indices of the subarray of `lst` that yields the maximum sum when combined with the square of its length, `over_sum` is this maximum sum, `i` is less than `len(lst)`, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, `sm` is the sum of the elements before index `i` and after index `j` in `lst` plus the square of the length of the subarray from index `i` to `j`, and `lst` has at least `i + 1` elements.**

In this output state, the value of `sm` is specifically calculated as the sum of the elements before index `i` and after index `j` in `lst` plus the square of the length of the subarray from index `i` to `j`. The other variables remain unchanged, with `r` and `l` still representing the indices of the subarray that yields the maximum sum, `over_sum` still representing this maximum sum, `i` still being less than the length of `lst`, `j` still being equal to `i + 1`, and `lst` still having at least `i + 1` elements.
