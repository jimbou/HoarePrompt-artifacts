To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects within it.

The loop head is `for i in range(len(lst)):`. This means we can only adjust the state of `i` and `lst`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `len(lst)`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `len(lst) - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, making it equal to `len(lst)`.

However, since `i` is now equal to `len(lst)`, the loop condition `i < len(lst)` is no longer true, and the loop will not execute again. Therefore, we cannot adjust the state to make the loop execute again.

But, we can still provide the state at the start of the next iteration, which would be the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration, since the loop will not execute again.

State: **`r` and `l` are the indices of the subarray of `lst` that yields the maximum sum when combined with the square of its length, `over_sum` is this maximum sum, `i` is equal to `len(lst)`, `j` is equal to `len(lst)`, and `sm` is not defined.**
