To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):`. The objects involved in the loop head are `j`, `i`, and `lst`.

According to the loop head, `j` takes on values from `i + 1` to `len(lst) - 1`. Since `j` is currently 1, we need to increment it to the next value in the range.

The next value of `j` would be `i + 2`, since `i` is less than `len(lst) - 1`.

The state of `i` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

The state of `lst` also remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

Now, let's update the state:

State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 2 elements. `r` and `l` are either 0 or equal to `i` and `j` respectively. `over_sum` is either the sum of all elements in `lst` or equal to `sm`. `i` is less than `lst` - 1, `j` is `i + 2`, and `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` except those between `i` and `j` (inclusive), plus the square of the difference between `j` and `i` plus 1. If `sm` is higher than `over_sum`, then `r` equals `i`, `l` equals `j`, and `over_sum` equals `sm`.**

Note that we didn't modify the states of `r`, `l`, `over_sum`, and `sm` as they are not directly involved in the loop head. Their values will be updated based on the loop body, which is not shown here.
