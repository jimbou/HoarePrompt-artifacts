Output State: **lst is a list of non-negative integers with at least 2 elements, r is i, l is j, over_sum is sm, i is less than lst - 1, j is i + 2, and sm is the sum of all elements in lst except those between i and j (inclusive), plus the square of the difference between j and i plus 1.**

In this output state, the values of `r`, `l`, and `over_sum` have been updated based on the initial state and the code snippet. The list `lst`, indices `i` and `j`, and the sum `sm` remain unchanged. The new values of `r` and `l` are now equal to `i` and `j`, respectively, and `over_sum` is now equal to `sm`.
