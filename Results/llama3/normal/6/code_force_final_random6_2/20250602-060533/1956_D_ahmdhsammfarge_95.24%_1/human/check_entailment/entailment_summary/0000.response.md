Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program starts by reading the input and initializing an empty list `ops` to store the operations.

2. The `func_1` function finds the subarray within the given list of non-negative integers that yields the maximum sum when combined with the square of its length. This function is correct based on its execution summary, which states that it returns the indices of the subarray that yields the maximum sum.

3. The main program then enters a while loop that continues until `r` is equal to `l`. In each iteration, it calls `func_3` to replace the sublist of `lst` from index `r` to `l` with a new list of equal length, where all elements are equal to the length of the sublist. This is done to maximize the sum of the elements in the array.

4. The `func_3` function is correct based on its execution summary, which states that it replaces a sublist of a given list with a new list of equal length, where all elements are equal to the length of the sublist. It also appends operations to `ops` based on the minimum value of the sublist.

5. After the while loop, the program tries to find any zeros in the list and replaces them with ones. This is done to further maximize the sum of the elements in the array.

6. Finally, the program prints the maximum sum of the elements in the array and the number of operations in the solution, followed by the operations themselves.

Overall, the program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. It correctly finds the maximum sum of the elements in the array and constructs a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
