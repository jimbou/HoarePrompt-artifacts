Output State: **`r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l, `lst` is a list of integers, `ops` is a list of lists of integers, and `ops` now contains an additional list `[r + 1, l + 1]`**.

In natural language, the output state is that the values of `r` and `l` remain the same, the list `lst` is unchanged, and the list `ops` has been updated to include a new list containing the values `r + 1` and `l + 1`.
