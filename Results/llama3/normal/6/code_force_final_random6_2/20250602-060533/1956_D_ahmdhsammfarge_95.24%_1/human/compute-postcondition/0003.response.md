Postcondition: ***`r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l, `lst` is a list of integers, `ops` is a list of lists of integers, and `ops` now contains an additional list `[r + 1, l + 1]`. If the minimum value of the sublist of `lst` from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) is 0, then this condition is met. Otherwise, no additional conditions are met.***
