Output State: **`r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l, `lst` is a list of integers where the sublist from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) is replaced with a list of `l - r + 1` elements, all equal to `l - r + 1`, `ops` is a list of lists of integers where two new sublists `[r + 1, r + 1]` and `[r + 1, l + 1]` are appended, and the function `func_2(r, l, ops)` has been executed with the current values of `r`, `l`, and `ops`.**

In this output state, the values of `r` and `l` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The list `lst` is modified by replacing the sublist from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) with a new list containing `l - r + 1` elements, all equal to `l - r + 1`. The list `ops` is modified by appending two new sublists `[r + 1, r + 1]` and `[r + 1, l + 1]`. The function `func_2(r, l, ops)` is executed with the current values of `r`, `l`, and `ops`, but its effects are not specified in the code snippet, so its impact on the state is not included in the output state.
