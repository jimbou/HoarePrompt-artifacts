#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of non-negative integers.

    return r, l
    #The program returns the indices r and l of the subarray of lst that yields the maximum sum when combined with the square of its length.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function finds the subarray within a given list of non-negative integers that yields the maximum sum when combined with the square of its length, and returns the indices of this subarray.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: r and l are integers such that r >= l >= 0, and ops is a list that stores operations in the form of [r+1, l+1].
    if (r == l) :
        ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
        return
        #The program returns nothing because there is no return statement in the given code snippet. The variables 'r', 'l', and 'ops' remain unchanged with values 0, 0, and [[1, 1]] respectively.
    #State: *r and l are integers such that r >= l >= 0, and r is not equal to l, and ops is a list that stores operations in the form of [r+1, l+1].
    func_2(r, l - 1, ops)
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    func_2(r, l - 1, ops)

#Overall this is what the function does:This function generates a list of operations in the form of [r+1, l+1] and appends them to the 'ops' list. It takes two integers 'r' and 'l' as input, where 'r' is greater than or equal to 'l', and 'l' is greater than or equal to 0. If 'r' is equal to 'l', it appends a single operation to the 'ops' list. If 'r' is not equal to 'l', it recursively calls itself with 'l' decremented by 1, appends an operation to the 'ops' list, and then calls itself again with the same parameters. The function does not return any value.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: r and l are integers such that 0 <= r <= l, lst is a list of integers, and ops is a list of lists of integers.
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    if (min(lst[r:l + 1]) == 0) :
        ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    #State: *`r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l, `lst` is a list of integers, `ops` is a list of lists of integers, and `ops` now contains an additional list `[r + 1, l + 1]`. If the minimum value of the sublist of `lst` from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) is 0, then this condition is met. Otherwise, no additional conditions are met.
    ops.append([r + 1, r + 1])
    func_2(r, l, ops)
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    n = l - r + 1
    lst[r:l + 1] = [n for _ in range(n)]
    return lst
    #The program returns a list of integers where the sublist from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) is replaced with a list of `l - r + 1` elements, all equal to `l - r + 1`.

#Overall this is what the function does:Replaces a sublist of a given list with a new list of equal length, where all elements are equal to the length of the sublist. The function accepts a list of integers, two integers `r` and `l` representing the start and end indices of the sublist, and a list of operations `ops`. It appends operations to `ops` based on the minimum value of the sublist and then replaces the sublist with a new list of equal length, where all elements are equal to the length of the sublist. The function returns the modified list.
