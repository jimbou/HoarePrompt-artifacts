Postcondition: ***`r` and `l` are the indices of the subarray of `lst` that yields the maximum sum when combined with the square of its length, `over_sum` is this maximum sum. If the sum of the subarray from index 0 to `i-1`, the subarray from index `j+1` to the end of `lst`, and the square of the length of the subarray from index `i` to `j` is greater than `over_sum`, then `r` is set to `i`, `l` is set to `j`, and `over_sum` is updated to this sum. Otherwise, `r`, `l`, and `over_sum` remain unchanged.***
