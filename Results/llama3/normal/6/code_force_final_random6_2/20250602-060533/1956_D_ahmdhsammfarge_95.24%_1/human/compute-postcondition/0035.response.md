Output State: **r is i, l is j, over_sum is sm, i is less than len(lst), j is equal to i + 1, sm is the sum of the elements before index i and after index j in lst plus the square of the length of the subarray from index i to j, and lst has at least i + 1 elements.**

The code assigns the values of `i` and `j` to `r` and `l`, respectively, and assigns the value of `sm` to `over_sum`. The values of `i`, `j`, `sm`, and `lst` remain unchanged. The only changes are the new assignments to `r`, `l`, and `over_sum`.
