Output State: **r is i, l is j, over_sum is sm, i is less than len(lst) - 1, j is equal to i + 2, and sm is the sum of the subarray of lst that excludes the elements from index i to j (inclusive), plus the square of the length of this subarray.**

Explanation: The first line assigns the value of `[i, j]` to `r` and `l`. Since `i` is less than `len(lst) - 1` and `j` is equal to `i + 2`, `r` becomes `i` and `l` becomes `j`. The second line assigns the value of `sm` to `over_sum`. Since `sm` is the sum of the subarray of `lst` that excludes the elements from index `i` to `j` (inclusive), plus the square of the length of this subarray, `over_sum` becomes equal to `sm`. No other variables are affected.
