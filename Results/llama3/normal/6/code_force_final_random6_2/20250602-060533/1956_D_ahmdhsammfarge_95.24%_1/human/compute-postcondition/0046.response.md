Output State: **r and l are the indices of the subarray of lst that yields the maximum sum when combined with the square of its length, over_sum is this maximum sum, i is equal to len(lst), j is equal to len(lst), and sm is not defined.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variables r and l hold the indices of the subarray in lst that yields the maximum sum when combined with the square of its length. The variable over_sum holds this maximum sum. The loop variables i and j are equal to the length of lst, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations. The variable sm is not defined, as it is only defined within the loop body and is not accessible outside the loop.
