Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 2 elements, `r` and `l` are either 0 or equal to `i` and `j` respectively, `over_sum` is either the sum of all elements in `lst` or equal to `sm`. If `sm` is higher than `over_sum`, then `r` equals `i`, `l` equals `j`, and `over_sum` equals `sm`. Otherwise, `r` and `l` remain 0 and `over_sum` remains the sum of all elements in `lst`***
