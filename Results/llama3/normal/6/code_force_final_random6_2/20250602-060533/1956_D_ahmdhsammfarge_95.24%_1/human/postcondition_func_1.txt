This function generates a list of operations in the form of [r+1, l+1] and appends them to the 'ops' list. It takes two integers 'r' and 'l' as input, where 'r' is greater than or equal to 'l', and 'l' is greater than or equal to 0. If 'r' is equal to 'l', it appends a single operation to the 'ops' list. If 'r' is not equal to 'l', it recursively calls itself with 'l' decremented by 1, appends an operation to the 'ops' list, and then calls itself again with the same parameters. The function does not return any value.
