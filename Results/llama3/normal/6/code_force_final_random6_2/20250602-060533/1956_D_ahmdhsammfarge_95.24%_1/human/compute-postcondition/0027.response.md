Output State: **`r` and `l` are the indices of the subarray of `lst` that yields the maximum sum when combined with the square of its length, `over_sum` is this maximum sum, `j` is `i + 2`, `sm` is the sum of the subarray from index 0 to `i-1`, the subarray from index `j+1` to the end of `lst`, and the square of the length of the subarray from index `i` to `j`.**

In this output state, the value of `sm` is calculated based on the current values of `i` and `j`, and the contents of the list `lst`. The other variables, `r`, `l`, `over_sum`, and `j`, retain their previous values, as they are not modified by the given code.
