To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `j`, `i`, and `lst`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `len(lst)`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, and `lst` has at least 2 elements.

To execute the loop again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes `i + 2`. The length of `lst` remains the same, so `len(lst)` is still greater than or equal to 3.

The other variables `r`, `l`, `over_sum`, and `sm` are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 2 elements, `r` and `l` are either 0 or equal to `i` and `j` respectively, `over_sum` is either the sum of all elements in `lst` or equal to `sm`. If `sm` is higher than `over_sum`, then `r` equals `i`, `l` equals `j`, and `over_sum` equals `sm`. Otherwise, `r` and `l` remain 0 and `over_sum` remains the sum of all elements in `lst`, `j` is `i + 2`**
