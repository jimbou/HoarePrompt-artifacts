Output State: **`r` and `l` are the indices of the subarray of `lst` that yields the maximum sum when combined with the square of its length, `over_sum` is this maximum sum, `i` is equal to `len(lst)`, `j` is equal to `len(lst)`, and `sm` is not defined.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will be the same as the initial state, with the exception that `r`, `l`, and `over_sum` will have been updated to reflect the maximum sum and its corresponding subarray indices. The loop will have iterated over all possible subarrays of `lst`, and the maximum sum and its indices will have been found and stored in `over_sum`, `r`, and `l`, respectively. The values of `i` and `j` will have been reset to their initial values, and `sm` will no longer be defined.
