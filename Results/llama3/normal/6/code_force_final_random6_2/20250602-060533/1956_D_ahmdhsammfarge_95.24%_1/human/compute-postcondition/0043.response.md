Output State: **r is i, l is j, over_sum is sm, i is less than len(lst), j is equal to i + 3, sm is the sum of the elements before index i and after index j in lst plus the square of the length of the subarray from index i to j, and lst has at least i + 3 elements.**

In this output state, the values of `r` and `l` have been updated to `i` and `j` respectively, and `over_sum` has been updated to `sm`. The values of `i`, `j`, `sm`, and `lst` remain unchanged.
