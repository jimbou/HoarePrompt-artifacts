Output State: **The program returns a list of integers where the sublist from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) is replaced with a list of `l - r + 1` elements, all equal to `l - r + 1`.**

In this output state, the returned list `lst` has been modified such that the elements from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) have been replaced with a new list containing `l - r + 1` elements, all of which are equal to `l - r + 1`. This is the result of the previous operations performed on the list, as described in the initial state.
