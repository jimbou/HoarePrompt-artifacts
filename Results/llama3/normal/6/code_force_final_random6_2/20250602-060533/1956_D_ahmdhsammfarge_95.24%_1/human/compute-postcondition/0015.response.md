Output State: **`r` and `l` are the indices of the subarray of `lst` that yields the maximum sum when combined with the square of its length, `over_sum` is this maximum sum, `i` is equal to `len(lst) - 1`, `j` is equal to `len(lst)`, and `sm` is not defined.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that `r` and `l` will hold the indices of the subarray in `lst` that produces the maximum sum when added to the square of its length. The variable `over_sum` will store this maximum sum. The loop counter `i` will have reached the second last index of `lst`, and `j` will be equal to the length of `lst`, indicating that the loop has iterated over all elements. The variable `sm` will no longer be defined as it is only used within the loop.
