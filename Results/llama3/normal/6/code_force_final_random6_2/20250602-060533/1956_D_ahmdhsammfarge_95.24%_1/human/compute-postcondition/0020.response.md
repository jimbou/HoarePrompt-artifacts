Output State: **r is i, l is j, over_sum is sm, i is less than len(lst) - 1, j is equal to i + 1, and sm is greater than its original value of over_sum.**

The code assigns the value of `i` to `r` and the value of `j` to `l`. Since `i` is less than `len(lst) - 1` and `j` is equal to `i + 1`, `r` becomes less than `len(lst) - 1` and `l` becomes equal to `r + 1`. The code also assigns the value of `sm` to `over_sum`. Since `sm` is greater than its original value of `over_sum`, `over_sum` becomes greater than its original value. The values of `i` and `j` are not modified by the code, so they remain the same.
