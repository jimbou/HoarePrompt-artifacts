The only variables in the loop head are variables  j, i and lst, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `lst`. If lst has at least `i + 1` elements, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is equal to `len(lst)`, which means the loop will not execute because the range of the loop starts from `i + 1` and ends at `len(lst)`. Therefore, `i` must be less than `len(lst)` for the loop to execute. Also, `j` is the loop variable, so it should be equal to `i + 1` at the start of the loop.

State: **`r` and `l` are the indices of the subarray of `lst` that yields the maximum sum when combined with the square of its length, `over_sum` is this maximum sum, `i` is less than `len(lst)`, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, `sm` is not defined, and `lst` has at least `i + 1` elements**
