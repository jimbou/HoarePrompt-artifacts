Postcondition: ***`r` and `l` are the indices of the subarray of `lst` that yields the maximum sum when combined with the square of its length, `over_sum` is this maximum sum, `i` is less than `len(lst)`, `j` is equal to `i + 3`, `sm` is the sum of the elements before index `i` and after index `j` in `lst` plus the square of the length of the subarray from index `i` to `j`, and `lst` has at least `i + 3` elements. If `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, then `r` is set to `i`, `l` is set to `j`, and `over_sum` is updated to `sm`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
