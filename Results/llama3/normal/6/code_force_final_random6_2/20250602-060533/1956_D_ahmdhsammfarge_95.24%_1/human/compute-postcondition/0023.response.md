Output State: **`r` and `l` are the indices of the subarray of `lst` that yields the maximum sum when combined with the square of its length, `over_sum` is this maximum sum, `i` is less than `len(lst) - 1`, `j` is equal to `i + 2`, and `sm` is the sum of the subarray of `lst` that excludes the elements from index `i` to `j` (inclusive), plus the square of the length of this subarray, where `sm` is now recalculated to include the sum of elements before index `i` and after index `j+1`, and the square of the length of the subarray from `i` to `j` (inclusive).**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `r`, `l`, `over_sum`, `i`, and `j` remain the same as before. However, the value of `sm` is updated to include the sum of elements in the list `lst` before index `i` and after index `j+1`, plus the square of the length of the subarray from `i` to `j` (inclusive).
