Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of elements in an array by performing a specific operation. The operation involves choosing two integers `l` and `r` such that `1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n`, computing `x` as the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the set `{a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r}`, and simultaneously setting `a_l := x, a_{l+1} := x, ..., a_r := x`.

The program consists of three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`.

`func_1` takes a list `lst` as input and returns the indices `r` and `l` that maximize the sum of the elements in the list. It does this by iterating over all possible pairs of indices and computing the sum of the elements outside the pair, plus the square of the length of the pair. The pair with the maximum sum is returned.

`func_2` takes indices `r` and `l`, and a list `ops` as input. It is a recursive function that generates a sequence of operations to transform the list `lst` into a list with all elements equal to `l - r + 1`. The function works by recursively calling itself with `l - 1` and then appending the operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the list `ops`.

`func_3` takes indices `r` and `l`, a list `lst`, and a list `ops` as input. It generates a sequence of operations to transform the list `lst` into a list with all elements equal to `l - r + 1`. The function works by appending the operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the list `ops`, and then recursively calling `func_2` with `r` and `l`. If the minimum element in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0, the function appends the operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the list `ops` again. Finally, the function appends the operation `[r + 1, r + 1]` to the list `ops` and updates the list `lst` by setting all elements in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` to `l - r + 1`.

The main program reads the input, calls `func_1` to find the indices `r` and `l` that maximize the sum of the elements, and then calls `func_3` to generate the sequence of operations. The program then prints the maximum sum and the sequence of operations.

Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it correctly implements the algorithm described in the problem statement. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` work together to find the indices `r` and `l` that maximize the sum of the elements, and then generate a sequence of operations to transform the list into a list with all elements equal to `l - r + 1`. The program also correctly handles the case where the minimum element in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0.
