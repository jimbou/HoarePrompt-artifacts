To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range from `i + 1` to `len(lst) - 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `j` is equal to `i + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`r` and `l` are the indices of the subarray of `lst` that yields the maximum sum when combined with the square of its length, `over_sum` is this maximum sum, `i` is less than `len(lst) - 1`, `j` is equal to `i + 2`, and `sm` is the sum of the subarray of `lst` that excludes the elements from index `i` to `j` (inclusive), plus the square of the length of this subarray.**
