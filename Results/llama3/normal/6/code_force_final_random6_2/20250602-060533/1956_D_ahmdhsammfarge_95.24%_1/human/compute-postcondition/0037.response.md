The only variable in the loop head is variable `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `len(lst)`. If `j` is less than `len(lst)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, `i` is less than `len(lst)`, and `lst` has at least `i + 1` elements. So for the loop to be executed one more time `j` must be increased by 1.
State: **`r` and `l` are the indices of the subarray of `lst` that yields the maximum sum when combined with the square of its length, `over_sum` is this maximum sum, `i` is less than `len(lst)`, `j` is equal to `i + 2`, `sm` is the sum of the elements before index `i` and after index `j` in `lst` plus the square of the length of the subarray from index `i` to `j`, and `lst` has at least `i + 2` elements.**
