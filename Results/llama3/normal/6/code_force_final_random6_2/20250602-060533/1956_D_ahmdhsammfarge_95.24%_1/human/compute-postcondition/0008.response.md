Output State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 2 elements. `r` and `l` are either 0 or equal to `i` and `j` respectively. `over_sum` is either the sum of all elements in `lst` or equal to `sm`. `i` is less than `lst` - 1, `j` is `i + 2`, and `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` except those between `i` and `j` (inclusive), plus the square of the difference between `j` and `i` plus 1. If `sm` is higher than `over_sum`, then `r` equals `i`, `l` equals `j`, and `over_sum` equals `sm`.**

In this output state, the value of `sm` has been updated to be the sum of all elements in `lst` except those between `i` and `j` (inclusive), plus the square of the difference between `j` and `i` plus 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that `sm` is now a specific value, which is the sum of all elements in `lst` except those between `i` and `j` (inclusive), plus the square of the difference between `j` and `i` plus 1.
