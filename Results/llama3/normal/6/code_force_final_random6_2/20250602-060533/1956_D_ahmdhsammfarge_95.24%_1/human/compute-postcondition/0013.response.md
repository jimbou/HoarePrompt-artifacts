Output State: **lst is a list of non-negative integers with at least 2 elements, r is equal to i, l is equal to j, over_sum is equal to sm, j is i + 2, sm is the sum of the first i elements of lst, the sum of the elements of lst after index j, and the square of the difference between j and i plus 1.**

In this output state, the values of `r` and `l` have been updated to be equal to `i` and `j` respectively, based on the assignment `r, l = [i, j]`. The value of `over_sum` has also been updated to be equal to `sm`, based on the assignment `over_sum = sm`. All other variables, including `lst`, `j`, and `sm`, remain unchanged.
