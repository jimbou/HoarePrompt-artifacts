The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `len(lst)`. If `i` is less than `len(lst)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `len(lst)`, so for the loop to execute again `i` must be less than `len(lst)`. However, since `i` is already equal to `len(lst)`, it means the loop has already finished executing and there will be no next iteration. Therefore, the state remains the same.

State: **`r` and `l` are the indices of the subarray of `lst` that yields the maximum sum when combined with the square of its length, `over_sum` is this maximum sum, `i` is equal to `len(lst)`, `j` is equal to `len(lst)`, and `sm` is not defined.**
