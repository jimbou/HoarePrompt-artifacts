The code calculates the sum of the subarray of `lst` that excludes the elements from index `i` to `j` (inclusive), and adds the square of the length of this subarray. This sum is assigned to the variable `sm`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`r` and `l` are the indices of the subarray of `lst` that yields the maximum sum when combined with the square of its length, `over_sum` is this maximum sum, `i` is less than `len(lst) - 1`, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, and `sm` is the sum of the subarray of `lst` that excludes the elements from index `i` to `j` (inclusive), plus the square of the length of this subarray.**
