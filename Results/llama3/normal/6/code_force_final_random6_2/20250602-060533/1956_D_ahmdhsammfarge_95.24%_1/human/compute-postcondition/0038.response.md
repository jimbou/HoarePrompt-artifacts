Output State: **`r` and `l` are the indices of the subarray of `lst` that yields the maximum sum when combined with the square of its length, `over_sum` is this maximum sum, `i` is less than `len(lst)`, `j` is equal to `i + 2`, `sm` is the sum of the elements before index `i` and after index `j` in `lst` plus the square of the length of the subarray from index `i` to `j`, and `lst` has at least `i + 2` elements.**

In this output state, `sm` is updated to be the sum of the elements before index `i` and after index `j` in `lst` plus the square of the length of the subarray from index `i` to `j`. The values of the other variables are not affected.
