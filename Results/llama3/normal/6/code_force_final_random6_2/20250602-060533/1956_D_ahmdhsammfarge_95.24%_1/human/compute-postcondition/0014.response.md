Postcondition: ***lst is a list of non-negative integers with at least 2 elements, j is i + 2, sm is the sum of the first i elements of lst, the sum of the elements of lst after index j, and the square of the difference between j and i plus 1. If sm is greater than over_sum, then r is equal to i, l is equal to j, and over_sum is equal to sm. Otherwise, no changes are made to r, l, and over_sum.***
