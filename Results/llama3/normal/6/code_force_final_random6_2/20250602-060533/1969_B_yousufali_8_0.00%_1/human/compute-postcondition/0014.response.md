Output State: **`s` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, each integer is either 0 or 1. `i` is 2. If the first element of `s` is 1, then `n` is 3 if the current element `s[i]` is 1, otherwise `n` is 2. If the first element of `s` is 0, then `n` is 1. If the first element of `s` is 1 and the current element `s[i]` is 0, then `ans` is 3. If the first element of `s` is 1 and the current element `s[i]` is 1, then `ans` is 3. If the first element of `s` is 0, then `ans` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `s` remains the same, and the index `i` is still 2. The value of `n` has been incremented by 1. If the first element of `s` is 1, then `n` is now 3 if the current element `s[i]` is 1, otherwise `n` is 2. If the first element of `s` is 0, then `n` is now 1. The value of `ans` remains the same, which is 3 if the first element of `s` is 1, and 1 if the first element of `s` is 0.
