Output State: **`s` is a list of integers, each integer is either 0 or 1, `n` is the number of 1's in `s`, `ans` is the sum of the lengths of all the sequences of 1's in `s` plus the number of 0's that follow each sequence of 1's.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `s` remains the same list of integers, `n` becomes the total count of 1's in the list, and `ans` becomes the sum of the lengths of all the sequences of 1's in the list plus the number of 0's that follow each sequence of 1's.
