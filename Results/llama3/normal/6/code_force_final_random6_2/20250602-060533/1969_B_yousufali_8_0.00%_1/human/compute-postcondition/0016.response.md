Output State: **`s` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, each integer is either 0 or 1. `i` is 2. If the first element of `s` is 1, then `n` is 3 if the current element `s[i]` is 1, otherwise `n` is 2. If the first element of `s` is 0, then `n` is 1. `ans` is 5 if the first element of `s` is 1 and the current element `s[i]` is 1, `ans` is 4 if the first element of `s` is 1 and the current element `s[i]` is 0, otherwise `ans` is 3.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `s` still contains at least 3 integers, all of which are either 0 or 1. The value of `i` remains 2. The value of `n` depends on the first element of `s` and the current element `s[i]`. If the first element of `s` is 1, then `n` is 3 if `s[i]` is 1, otherwise `n` is 2. If the first element of `s` is 0, then `n` is 1. The value of `ans` has been updated based on the value of `n`. If the first element of `s` is 1 and `s[i]` is 1, then `ans` is 5. If the first element of `s` is 1 and `s[i]` is 0, then `ans` is 4. Otherwise, `ans` is 3.
