Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^4) and `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-1 binary strings s (2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5; s_i in {0, 1})**

In this output state, the value of `t` is still an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0. The value of `_` remains 0. The stdin now contains t-1 binary strings s, each of length between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), and each character s_i in the string is either 0 or 1.
