The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by `t` binary strings `s`. Since the first input is an integer, it is consumed by the `input()` function and assigned to `t`. The remaining inputs in the stdin are the `t` binary strings `s`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^4), stdin contains t binary strings s (2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5; s_i in {0, 1})**
