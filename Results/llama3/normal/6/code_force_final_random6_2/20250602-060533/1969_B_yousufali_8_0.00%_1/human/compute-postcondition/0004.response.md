Output State: **`t` is an integer (2 <= t <= 10^4) and `t` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, stdin contains t-2 binary strings s (2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5; s_i in {0, 1}), and the function func_1() has been called and its return value has been ignored.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-2 binary strings s, each of length between 2 and 2 * 10^5, consisting only of 0s and 1s. The function func_1() has been executed, but its return value has been ignored, so it does not affect the state of the program.
