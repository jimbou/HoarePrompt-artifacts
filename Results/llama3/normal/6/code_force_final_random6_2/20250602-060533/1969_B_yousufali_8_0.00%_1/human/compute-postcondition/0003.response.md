The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time the `_` is 1 and `t` must be greater than 1 and stdin contains t-2 binary strings s.
State: **`t` is an integer (2 <= t <= 10^4) and `t` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, stdin contains t-2 binary strings s (2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5; s_i in {0, 1})**
