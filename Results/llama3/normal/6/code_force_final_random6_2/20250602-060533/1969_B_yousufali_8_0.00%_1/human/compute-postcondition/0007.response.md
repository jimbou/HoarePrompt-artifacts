Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^4) and `t` must be greater than or equal to 0, `_` is t-1, stdin contains 0 binary strings s (2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5; s_i in {0, 1}), and the function func_1() has been called t times and its return value has been ignored.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the variable `t` will be greater than or equal to 0 (since it started with a value between 1 and 10^4), the loop counter `_` will be equal to `t-1` (since it increments by 1 in each iteration), there will be no more binary strings in stdin (since they are processed in each iteration), and the function `func_1()` will have been called `t` times with its return value ignored.
