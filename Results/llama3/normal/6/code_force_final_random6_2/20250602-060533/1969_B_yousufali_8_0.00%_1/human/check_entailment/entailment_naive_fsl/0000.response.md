Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, if the input string is "101", the program will output 3, but the correct answer is 2. The program is not considering the case where the substring can be shifted cyclically.

In the given program, the function `func_1()` is trying to count the number of operations required to sort the binary string. However, it is not considering the case where the substring can be shifted cyclically. The program is only considering the case where the substring is shifted to the right.

For example, in the case of the input string "101", the program will output 3, but the correct answer is 2. This is because the program is not considering the case where the substring "10" can be shifted cyclically to get "01", which is already sorted.

Therefore, the program is not correct for all cases, and the correctness is **False**.
