Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of each operation is equal to the length of the chosen substring.

Function `func_1()` calculates the sum of lengths of all sequences of 1's in a given list of binary integers plus the number of 0's that follow each sequence of 1's. This is equivalent to finding the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted, as each sequence of 1's can be shifted to the left by one position by performing a cyclic shift on the substring ending at the last 1 in the sequence, and the cost of this operation is equal to the length of the sequence plus the number of 0's that follow it.

Function `func_2()` reads an integer `t` from standard input, then calls `func_1()` `t` times, ignoring its return value. This is equivalent to reading `t` binary strings and finding the minimum total cost to make each string sorted.

Since `func_1()` correctly calculates the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted, and `func_2()` correctly reads the input and calls `func_1()` the correct number of times, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
