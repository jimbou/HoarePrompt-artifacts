Postcondition: ***`s` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, each integer is either 0 or 1. `i` is 2. If the first element of `s` is 1, then `n` is 3 if the current element `s[i]` is 1, otherwise `n` is 2. If the first element of `s` is 0, then `n` is 1. If the first element of `s` is 1 and the current element `s[i]` is 1, `ans` is 5. If the first element of `s` is 1 and the current element `s[i]` is 0, `ans` is 4. If the first element of `s` is 0, `ans` is 3.***
