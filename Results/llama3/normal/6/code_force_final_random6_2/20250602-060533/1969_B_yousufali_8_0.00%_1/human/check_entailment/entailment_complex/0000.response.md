Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of each operation is equal to the length of the chosen substring.

Function 1 calculates the sum of lengths of all sequences of 1's in a given list of binary integers plus the number of 0's that follow each sequence of 1's. This is not directly related to the problem, as it does not consider the cost of cyclic shifts.

Function 2 reads an integer t from standard input, then calls function func_1() t times, ignoring its return value. However, function func_1() does not solve the problem, and its return value is not used.

The correct solution would involve finding the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. This would require a different approach, such as using dynamic programming or greedy algorithms.

Correctness: **False**
