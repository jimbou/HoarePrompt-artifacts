The `print(ans)` statement will print the calculated value of `ans`, which is the sum of the lengths of all the sequences of 1's in the list `s` plus the number of 0's that follow each sequence of 1's.

Since the exact list `s` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated sum of sequence lengths and following 0's.

Output: **sum of lengths of all sequences of 1's in s plus the number of 0's that follow each sequence of 1's**
