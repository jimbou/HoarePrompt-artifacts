Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a list of integers, each integer is either 0 or 1.
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == 1:
            n += 1
        
        if s[i] == 0 and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
        
    #State: `s` is a list of integers, each integer is either 0 or 1, `n` is the number of 1's in `s`, `ans` is the sum of the lengths of all the sequences of 1's in `s` plus the number of 0's that follow each sequence of 1's.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: sum of lengths of all sequences of 1's in s plus the number of 0's that follow each sequence of 1's

#Overall this is what the function does:Calculates and returns the sum of lengths of all sequences of 1's in a given list of binary integers plus the number of 0's that follow each sequence of 1's.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t binary strings s (2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5; s_i in {0, 1})
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^4) and `t` must be greater than or equal to 0, `_` is t-1, stdin contains 0 binary strings s (2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5; s_i in {0, 1}), and the function func_1() has been called t times and its return value has been ignored.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads an integer t from standard input, then calls function func_1() t times, ignoring its return value, and does not modify the input variable t or the binary strings s.
