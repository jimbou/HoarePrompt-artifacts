Output State: **`t` is an integer (2 <= t <= 10^4) and `t` must be greater than 2, `_` is 2, stdin contains t-3 binary strings s (2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5; s_i in {0, 1}), and the function func_1() has been called and its return value has been ignored.**

The code snippet provided is simply a function call to `func_1()` without any arguments or return value assignments. Since the function call does not modify any variables or stdin, the output state remains the same as the initial state. The function call is executed, but its return value is ignored, so no changes are made to the program state.
