Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of n integers, x is a list of n integers, monsters is a list of n tuples containing an integer from x and an integer from a, sorted by the absolute value of the integer from x, that must have at least 2 monsters, pos is the position of the second monster, health is the health of the second monster, bullets_used is the sum of the previous bullets used and the health of the first monster, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case consists of three lines, the first line contains two integers, the second line contains n integers, and the third line contains n integers, distance is the absolute value of the position of the first monster, total_bullets_needed is the sum of the updated bullets used and the health of the first monster, if total_bullets_needed is greater than distance times k, then can_survive is False. Otherwise, can_survive remains unchanged.***
