Output: **n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of n integers, x is a list of n integers, monsters is a list of n tuples, bullets_used is the sum of the initial bullets used and the health of all monsters, t is an integer greater than 2, _ is 2, distance is the absolute position of the last monster, total_bullets_needed is the sum of the updated bullets used and the health of the last monster, pos is the absolute position of the last monster, health is the health of the last monster. If total_bullets_needed is greater than distance times k, then can_survive is False. Otherwise, can_survive remains True and 'YES' is printed if can_survive is True, otherwise 'NO' is printed, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on the value of can_survive**
