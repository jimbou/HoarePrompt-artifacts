Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of n integers, x is a list of n integers, monsters is a list of n tuples containing the absolute position and health of each monster that must have at least 1 monster, bullets_used is 0, distance is the absolute value of the position of the first monster, total_bullets_needed is the sum of the bullets used and the health of the first monster, pos is the absolute position of the first monster, health is the health of the first monster. If total_bullets_needed is greater than distance times k, then can_survive is False. Otherwise, the value of can_survive remains unchanged.***
