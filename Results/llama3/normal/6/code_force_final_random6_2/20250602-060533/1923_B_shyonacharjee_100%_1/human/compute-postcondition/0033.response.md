Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of n integers, x is a list of n integers, monsters is a list of n tuples containing the absolute position and health of each monster that must have at least 2 monsters, bullets_used is the sum of the bullets used and the health of the second monster, distance is the absolute value of the position of the second monster, total_bullets_needed is the sum of the bullets used and the health of the second monster, pos is the absolute position of the second monster, health is the health of the second monster. If total_bullets_needed is greater than distance times k, can_survive is False. Otherwise, can_survive remains unchanged.***
