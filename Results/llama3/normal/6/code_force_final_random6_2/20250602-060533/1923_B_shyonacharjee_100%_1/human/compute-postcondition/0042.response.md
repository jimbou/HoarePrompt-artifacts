Based on the initial state, the print statement will print 'YES' if the value of `can_survive` is True, otherwise it will print 'NO'.

The value of `can_survive` is determined by the condition `total_bullets_needed > distance * k`. If this condition is True, then `can_survive` is False, otherwise it remains unchanged.

Since the exact values of `total_bullets_needed`, `distance`, and `k` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `can_survive`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on the value of `can_survive`.

Output: **YES if can_survive is True, otherwise NO**
