Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `monsters` is a list of `n` tuples containing an integer from `x` and an integer from `a`, sorted by the absolute value of the integer from `x`, that must have at least 1 monster, `pos` is the position of the first monster, `health` is the health of the first monster, `bullets_used` is the sum of the previous bullets used and the health of the first monster, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case consists of three lines, the first line contains two integers, the second line contains `n` integers, and the third line contains `n` integers, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the first monster, `total_bullets_needed` is the sum of the updated bullets used and the health of the first monster. If `total_bullets_needed` is greater than the product of `distance` and `k`, then `can_survive` is False. Otherwise, the value of `can_survive` remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases, the number of monsters, the list of monster positions, the list of monster healths, the list of monsters, the position of the first monster, the health of the first monster, and the number of bullets used have not changed. The number of bullets used has increased by the health of the first monster. The total number of bullets needed is now the sum of the updated bullets used and the health of the first monster. If this total is greater than the product of the distance to the first monster and the number of bullets that can be used per unit distance, then it is not possible to survive. Otherwise, the possibility of survival remains unchanged.
