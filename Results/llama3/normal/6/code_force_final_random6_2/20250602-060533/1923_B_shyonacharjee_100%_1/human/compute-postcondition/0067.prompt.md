You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains two integers n and k. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n. The third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n.
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        monsters = sorted(zip(x, a), key=lambda p: abs(p[0]))
        
        bullets_used = 0
        
        can_survive = True
        
        for pos, health in monsters:
            distance = abs(pos)
            total_bullets_needed = bullets_used + health
            if total_bullets_needed > distance * k:
                can_survive = False
                break
            bullets_used += health
        
        print('YES' if can_survive else 'NO')
        
    #State: t is an integer greater than or equal to 0, _ is t, n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of n integers, x is a list of n integers, monsters is a list of n tuples, bullets_used is the sum of the initial bullets used and the health of all monsters, distance is the absolute position of the last monster, total_bullets_needed is the sum of the updated bullets used and the health of the last monster, pos is the absolute position of the last monster, health is the health of the last monster. If total_bullets_needed is greater than distance times k, then can_survive is False. Otherwise, can_survive remains True and 'YES' is printed if can_survive is True, otherwise 'NO' is printed, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on the value of can_survive, and stdin contains no test cases.

```

Return Postconditions: t is an integer greater than or equal to 0, _ is t, n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of n integers, x is a list of n integers, monsters is a list of n tuples, bullets_used is the sum of the initial bullets used and the health of all monsters, distance is the absolute position of the last monster, total_bullets_needed is the sum of the updated bullets used and the health of the last monster, pos is the absolute position of the last monster, health is the health of the last monster. If total_bullets_needed is greater than distance times k, then can_survive is False. Otherwise, can_survive remains True and 'YES' is printed if can_survive is True, otherwise 'NO' is printed, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on the value of can_survive, and stdin contains no test cases.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
