Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if a player can survive a series of monster attacks based on the number of bullets used and the distance to each monster.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program sorts the monsters based on their absolute position, which is correct because the monsters move closer to the player based on their absolute position.
2.  It then iterates over the sorted monsters and calculates the total bullets needed to defeat each monster, taking into account the bullets already used.
3.  The program checks if the total bullets needed exceed the distance to the monster multiplied by the bullet usage rate. If this condition is met, it means the player cannot survive the attack, and the program sets `can_survive` to `False`.
4.  If the program iterates over all monsters without setting `can_survive` to `False`, it means the player can survive all attacks, and the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the conditions for the player to survive the monster attacks.

Correctness: **True**
