Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of n integers, x is a list of n integers, monsters is a list of n tuples, bullets_used is 0, can_survive is True, t is an integer greater than 2, _ is 2, distance is the absolute value of the position of the last monster, total_bullets_needed is the sum of the bullets used and the health of the last monster, pos is the absolute position of the last monster, health is the health of the last monster, and 'YES' is printed if can_survive is True, otherwise 'NO' is printed
Code of the loop:
for pos, health in monsters:
    distance = abs(pos)
    total_bullets_needed = bullets_used + health
    if total_bullets_needed > distance * k:
        can_survive = False
        break
    bullets_used += health


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `monsters` is a list of at least 1 tuple, `bullets_used` is the sum of the initial bullets used and the health of the first monster, `t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `distance` is the absolute position of the first monster, `total_bullets_needed` is the sum of the updated bullets used and the health of the first monster, `pos` is the absolute position of the first monster, `health` is the health of the first monster. If `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance` * `k`, then `can_survive` is False. Otherwise, `can_survive` remains True and 'YES' is printed if `can_survive` is True, otherwise 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `monsters` is a list of at least 2 tuples, `bullets_used` is the sum of the initial bullets used, the health of the first monster, and the health of the second monster, `t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `distance` is the absolute position of the second monster, `total_bullets_needed` is the sum of the updated bullets used and the health of the second monster, `pos` is the absolute position of the second monster, `health` is the health of the second monster. If `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance` times `k`, then `can_survive` is False.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `monsters` is a list of at least 3 tuples, `bullets_used` is the sum of the initial bullets used, the health of the first monster, the health of the second monster, and the health of the third monster, `t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `distance` is the absolute position of the third monster, `total_bullets_needed` is the sum of the updated bullets used and the health of the third monster, `pos` is the absolute position of the third monster, `health` is the health of the third monster. If `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance` times `k`, then `can_survive` is False. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
