Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of n integers, x is a list of n integers, monsters is a list of n tuples containing an integer from x and an integer from a, sorted by the absolute value of the integer from x, bullets_used is 0, can_survive is True, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case consists of three lines, the first line contains two integers, the second line contains n integers, and the third line contains n integers.
Code of the loop:
for pos, health in monsters:
    distance = abs(pos)
    total_bullets_needed = bullets_used + health
    if total_bullets_needed > distance * k:
        can_survive = False
        break
    bullets_used += health


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `monsters` is a list of `n` tuples containing an integer from `x` and an integer from `a`, sorted by the absolute value of the integer from `x`, that must have at least 1 monster, `pos` is the position of the first monster, `health` is the health of the first monster, `bullets_used` is the sum of the previous bullets used and the health of the first monster, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case consists of three lines, the first line contains two integers, the second line contains `n` integers, and the third line contains `n` integers, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the first monster, `total_bullets_needed` is the sum of the updated bullets used and the health of the first monster. If `total_bullets_needed` is greater than the product of `distance` and `k`, then `can_survive` is False. Otherwise, the value of `can_survive` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `monsters` is a list of `n` tuples containing an integer from `x` and an integer from `a`, sorted by the absolute value of the integer from `x`, that must have at least 2 monsters, `pos` is the position of the second monster, `health` is the health of the second monster, `bullets_used` is the sum of the previous bullets used, the health of the first monster, and the health of the second monster, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case consists of three lines, the first line contains two integers, the second line contains `n` integers, and the third line contains `n` integers, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the first monster, `total_bullets_needed` is the sum of the updated bullets used and the health of the first monster, if `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance` times `k`, then `can_survive` is False. Otherwise, `can_survive` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of n integers, x is a list of n integers, monsters is a list of n tuples containing an integer from x and an integer from a, sorted by the absolute value of the integer from x, that must have at least 3 monsters, pos is the position of the third monster, health is the health of the third monster, bullets_used is the sum of the previous bullets used, the health of the first monster, the health of the second monster, and the health of the third monster, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case consists of three lines, the first line contains two integers, the second line contains n integers, and the third line contains n integers, distance is the absolute value of the position of the third monster, total_bullets_needed is the sum of the updated bullets used and the health of the third monster, if total_bullets_needed is greater than distance times k, then can_survive is False, otherwise can_survive remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
