Postcondition: ***n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of n integers, x is a list of n integers, monsters is a list of at least 1 tuple, bullets_used is 0, t is an integer greater than 2, _ is 2, distance is the absolute position of the first monster, total_bullets_needed is the sum of the bullets used and the health of the first monster, pos is the absolute position of the first monster, health is the health of the first monster. If total_bullets_needed is greater than distance * k, then can_survive is False. Otherwise, can_survive remains True and 'YES' is printed if can_survive is True, otherwise 'NO' is printed.***
