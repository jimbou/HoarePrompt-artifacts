#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains two integers n and k. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n. The third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n.
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        monsters = sorted(zip(x, a), key=lambda p: abs(p[0]))
        
        bullets_used = 0
        
        can_survive = True
        
        for pos, health in monsters:
            distance = abs(pos)
            total_bullets_needed = bullets_used + health
            if total_bullets_needed > distance * k:
                can_survive = False
                break
            bullets_used += health
        
        print('YES' if can_survive else 'NO')
        
    #State: t is an integer greater than or equal to 0, _ is t, n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of n integers, x is a list of n integers, monsters is a list of n tuples, bullets_used is the sum of the initial bullets used and the health of all monsters, distance is the absolute position of the last monster, total_bullets_needed is the sum of the updated bullets used and the health of the last monster, pos is the absolute position of the last monster, health is the health of the last monster. If total_bullets_needed is greater than distance times k, then can_survive is False. Otherwise, can_survive remains True and 'YES' is printed if can_survive is True, otherwise 'NO' is printed, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on the value of can_survive, and stdin contains no test cases.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines whether a player can survive a series of monster attacks based on the number of bullets used and the distance to each monster. It takes no parameters and returns no value, but instead prints 'YES' if the player can survive all attacks and 'NO' otherwise. The function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of the number of monsters, the bullet usage rate, the initial bullets, and the positions and health of the monsters. It calculates the total bullets used to defeat each monster and checks if the player can survive based on the distance to the monster and the bullet usage rate.
