Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `monsters` is a list of `n` tuples containing the absolute position and health of each monster that must have at least 3 monsters, `bullets_used` is the sum of the bullets used, the health of the second monster, the health of the second monster, and the health of the third monster, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the third monster, `total_bullets_needed` is the sum of the bullets used, the health of the third monster, the health of the third monster, `pos` is the absolute position of the third monster, `health` is the health of the third monster, `can_survive` is False if `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance` times `k`, otherwise `can_survive` remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `bullets_used` has been updated to include the health of the third monster. All other variables remain unchanged.
