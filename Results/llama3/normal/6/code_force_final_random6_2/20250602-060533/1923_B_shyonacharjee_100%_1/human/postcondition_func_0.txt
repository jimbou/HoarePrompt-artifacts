This function determines whether a player can survive a series of monster attacks based on the number of bullets used and the distance to each monster. It takes no parameters and returns no value, but instead prints 'YES' if the player can survive all attacks and 'NO' otherwise. The function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of the number of monsters, the bullet usage rate, the initial bullets, and the positions and health of the monsters. It calculates the total bullets used to defeat each monster and checks if the player can survive based on the distance to the monster and the bullet usage rate.
