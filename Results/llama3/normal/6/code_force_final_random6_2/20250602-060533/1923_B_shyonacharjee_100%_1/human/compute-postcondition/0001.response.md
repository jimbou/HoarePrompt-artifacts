The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and `_` is now 0.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case consists of three lines, the first line contains two integers `n` and `k`, the second line contains `n` integers, and the third line contains `n` integers.**
