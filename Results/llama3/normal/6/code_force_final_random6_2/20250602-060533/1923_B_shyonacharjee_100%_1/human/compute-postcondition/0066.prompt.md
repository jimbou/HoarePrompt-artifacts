Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case consists of three lines, the first line contains two integers `n` and `k`, the second line contains `n` integers, and the third line contains `n` integers.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    monsters = sorted(zip(x, a), key=lambda p: abs(p[0]))
    bullets_used = 0
    can_survive = True
    for pos, health in monsters:
        distance = abs(pos)
        total_bullets_needed = bullets_used + health
        if total_bullets_needed > distance * k:
            can_survive = False
            break
        bullets_used += health
    print('YES' if can_survive else 'NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of n integers, x is a list of n integers, monsters is an empty list, pos is the position of the last monster, health is the health of the last monster, bullets_used is the sum of the health of all monsters, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case consists of three lines, the first line contains two integers, the second line contains n integers, and the third line contains n integers, distance is the absolute value of the position of the last monster, total_bullets_needed is the sum of the updated bullets used and the health of the last monster, if total_bullets_needed is greater than distance times k, then can_survive is False, otherwise can_survive remains unchanged, and 'YES' is printed if can_survive is True, otherwise 'NO' is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of n integers, x is a list of n integers, monsters is an empty list, bullets_used is the sum of the bullets used and the health of all monsters, distance is the absolute value of the position of the last monster, total_bullets_needed is the sum of the bullets used and the health of the last monster, pos is the absolute position of the last monster, health is the health of the last monster, and can_survive is False if total_bullets_needed is greater than distance times k, otherwise can_survive remains unchanged, and 'YES' is printed if can_survive is True, otherwise 'NO' is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of n integers, x is a list of n integers, monsters is a list of n tuples, bullets_used is the sum of the initial bullets used and the health of all monsters, t is an integer greater than 2, _ is 2, distance is the absolute position of the last monster, total_bullets_needed is the sum of the updated bullets used and the health of the last monster, pos is the absolute position of the last monster, health is the health of the last monster. If total_bullets_needed is greater than distance times k, then can_survive is False. Otherwise, can_survive remains True and 'YES' is printed if can_survive is True, otherwise 'NO' is printed, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on the value of can_survive




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
