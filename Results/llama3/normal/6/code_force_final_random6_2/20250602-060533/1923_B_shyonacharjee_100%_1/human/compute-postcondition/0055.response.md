Postcondition: **n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of n integers, x is a list of n integers, monsters is a list of at least 2 tuples, bullets_used is the sum of the initial bullets used and the health of the first monster, t is an integer greater than 2, _ is 2, distance is the absolute position of the second monster, total_bullets_needed is the sum of the updated bullets used and the health of the second monster, pos is the absolute position of the second monster, health is the health of the second monster. If total_bullets_needed is greater than distance times k, then can_survive is False.**
