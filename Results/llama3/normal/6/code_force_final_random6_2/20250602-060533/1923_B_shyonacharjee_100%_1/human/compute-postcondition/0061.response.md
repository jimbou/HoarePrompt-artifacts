Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `monsters` is a list of at least 3 tuples, `bullets_used` is the sum of the initial bullets used, the health of the first monster, the health of the second monster, and the health of the third monster, `t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `distance` is the absolute position of the third monster, `total_bullets_needed` is the sum of the updated bullets used and the health of the third monster, `pos` is the absolute position of the third monster, `health` is the health of the third monster. If `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance` times `k`, then `can_survive` is False. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `bullets_used` has been updated to include the health of the third monster. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The condition for `can_survive` is still dependent on the comparison between `total_bullets_needed` and `distance` times `k`.
