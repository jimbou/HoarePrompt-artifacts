Let's analyze the code step by step.

The code reads an integer from the standard input using `input()` and converts it to an integer using `int()`. This integer is assigned to the variable `t`.

Since the initial state mentions that stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case consists of three lines, we can infer that the first line of each test case contains two integers `n` and `k`. However, the code only reads the first integer `t` from the input.

The value of `t` is not specified in the initial state, but we know that it is an integer. Since the code reads the first integer from the input, we can assume that `t` is the first integer of the first test case.

The output state is: `t` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case consists of three lines, the first line contains two integers `n` and `k`, the second line contains `n` integers, and the third line contains `n` integers.

Output State: **`t` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case consists of three lines, the first line contains two integers `n` and `k`, the second line contains `n` integers, and the third line contains `n` integers.**
