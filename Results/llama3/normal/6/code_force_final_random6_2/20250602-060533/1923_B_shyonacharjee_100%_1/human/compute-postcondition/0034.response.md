Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `monsters` is a list of `n` tuples containing the absolute position and health of each monster that must have at least 2 monsters, `bullets_used` is the sum of the bullets used, the health of the second monster, and the health of the second monster, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the second monster, `total_bullets_needed` is the sum of the bullets used, the health of the second monster, and the health of the second monster, `pos` is the absolute position of the second monster, `health` is the health of the second monster. If `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance` times `k`, `can_survive` is False. Otherwise, `can_survive` remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `bullets_used` has been updated to include the health of the second monster, which is added to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for `can_survive` is still dependent on the comparison between `total_bullets_needed` and `distance` times `k`.
