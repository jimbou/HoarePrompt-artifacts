Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of n integers, x is a list of n integers, monsters is a list of at least 1 tuple, bullets_used is 0, can_survive is True, t is an integer greater than 2, _ is 2, distance is the absolute position of the first monster, total_bullets_needed is the sum of the bullets used and the health of the first monster, pos is the absolute position of the first monster, health is the health of the first monster, and 'YES' is printed if can_survive is True, otherwise 'NO' is printed**

The code modifies the values of `distance` and `total_bullets_needed`. The first line assigns the absolute position of the first monster to `distance`, and the second line assigns the sum of the bullets used and the health of the first monster to `total_bullets_needed`. All other variables remain unchanged.
