Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when k is 2 and n is 3. In this case, the program outputs [-1], but the correct output should be an array that satisfies the conditions. For example, the array [1, 2, 3] has 2 sorted cyclic shifts: [1, 2, 3] and [3, 1, 2]. 

The program only handles the cases when k is 1 or n, but it does not handle the case when k is 2 and n is 3. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
