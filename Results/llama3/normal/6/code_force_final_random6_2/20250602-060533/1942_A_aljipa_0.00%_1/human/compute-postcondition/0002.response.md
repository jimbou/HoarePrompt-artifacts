Output State: **t is an integer larger than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, res is a list of integers**.

The code snippet reads two integers from the input, assigns them to `n` and `k`, and then creates a list `res` based on the values of `n` and `k`. The list `res` is either a list of ones of length `n` if `k` equals `n`, a list of numbers from 0 to `n-1` if `k` equals 1, or a list containing only -1 if neither condition is met. The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged.
