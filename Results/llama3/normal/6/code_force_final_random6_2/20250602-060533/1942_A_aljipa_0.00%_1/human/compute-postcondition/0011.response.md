To determine what will be printed when the `print(*res)` statement is executed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions that define the value of `res`.

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer larger than 0.
   - `_` is 2 (this variable is not used in the given code snippet, so it doesn't affect the output).
   - `n` is an integer equal to the first integer in the input.
   - `k` is an integer equal to the second integer in the input.
   - `res` is a list of integers defined by conditions related to `n` and `k`.
   - `stdin` is empty, which implies there's no input being read or considered for this execution.

2. **Conditions Defining `res`**:
   - If `k` equals `n`, `res` is a list of integers equal to `[1] * n`.
   - If `k` equals 1, `res` is a list of integers equal to `range(n)`.
   - Otherwise, `res` is a list containing only `-1`.

Given these conditions, the output depends on the relationship between `n` and `k`. However, since the exact values of `n` and `k` are not provided, we can only describe the output based on the conditions that define `res`.

- **If `k` equals `n`**, the output will be a sequence of `n` ones, because `res` is defined as `[1] * n` in this case.

- **If `k` equals 1**, the output will be a sequence of integers from 0 to `n-1`, because `res` is defined as `range(n)` in this case.

- **For any other relationship between `n` and `k`**, the output will be `-1`, because `res` is defined as `[-1]` in this case.

Since the specific values of `n` and `k` are not given, we cannot provide a numerical output. However, we can describe the output based on the conditions:

Output: **Either a sequence of n ones if k equals n, a sequence of integers from 0 to n-1 if k equals 1, or -1 otherwise**
