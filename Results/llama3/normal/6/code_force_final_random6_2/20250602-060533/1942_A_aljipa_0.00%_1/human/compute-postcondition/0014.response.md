Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers, n and k. It then generates a list of integers based on the values of n and k. If k equals n, the list contains n ones. If k equals 1, the list contains the numbers from 0 to n-1. Otherwise, the list contains a single -1. The function prints the generated list for each test case.**
