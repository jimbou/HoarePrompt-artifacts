To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects within it.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only objects in the loop head are `_` and `t`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer larger than 1. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be decreased by 1, since the loop iterates over the range of `t`.

So, the adjusted state is:

State: **`t` is an integer larger than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer equal to the first integer in the input, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer in the input, `res` is a list of integers equal to [1] * n if k equals n, or range(n) if k equals 1, or [-1] otherwise, `stdin` is empty**

Note that the value of `_` is incremented by 1, since it is the loop variable, and the other variables remain unchanged.
