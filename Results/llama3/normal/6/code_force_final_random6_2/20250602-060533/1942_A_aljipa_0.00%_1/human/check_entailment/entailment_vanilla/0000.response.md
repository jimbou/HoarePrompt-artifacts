Reasoning:

The problem requires finding an array `a` of length `n` that has exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts. The program attempts to solve this problem by considering three cases:

1. If `k` is equal to `n`, the program returns an array of all ones. This is correct because an array of all ones has all its cyclic shifts sorted.

2. If `k` is equal to 1, the program returns an array of numbers from 0 to `n-1`. This is correct because an array of consecutive numbers has only one sorted cyclic shift (the original array itself).

3. If `k` is neither equal to `n` nor 1, the program returns an array containing only -1. This is correct because in this case, there is no array that satisfies the given conditions.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and returns the correct output for each case.

Correctness: **True**
