Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding an array `a` of length `n` that has exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts. The program takes the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`.

The program then constructs the result array `res` based on the values of `n` and `k`. If `k` equals `n`, it creates an array of `n` ones, which will have all `n` cyclic shifts sorted. If `k` equals 1, it creates an array of numbers from 0 to `n-1`, which will have only one sorted cyclic shift (the original array itself). For any other value of `k`, it sets `res` to `[-1]`, indicating that there is no valid array.

Finally, the program prints the elements of the `res` array.

The program's logic is correct based on the problem description. It correctly handles the cases where `k` equals `n` and `k` equals 1, and it correctly indicates that there is no valid array for any other value of `k`.

Correctness: **True**
