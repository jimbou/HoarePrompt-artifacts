Output State: **`t` is an integer larger than 0, stdin contains a series of pairs of integers (n and k), where 1 <= k <= n <= 10^3.**

In this output state, `t` is assigned the value of the first input, which is an integer representing the number of test cases. The stdin now contains a series of pairs of integers (n and k), where 1 <= k <= n <= 10^3, which are the remaining inputs.
