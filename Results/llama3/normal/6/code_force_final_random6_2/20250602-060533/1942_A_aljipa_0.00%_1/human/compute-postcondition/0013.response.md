Output State: **t is an integer larger than or equal to 0, _ is t, n is an integer equal to the first integer in the input, k is an integer equal to the second integer in the input, res is a list of integers equal to [1] * n if k equals n, or range(n) if k equals 1, or [-1] otherwise, stdin is empty, and the elements of the list res are printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop variable `_` is equal to the initial value of `t`, and the input `stdin` is empty. The values of `n`, `k`, and `res` are determined by the last iteration of the loop, and the elements of `res` are printed. The value of `t` is either 0 (if the loop executed 0 times) or larger than 0 (if the loop executed at least 1 time).
