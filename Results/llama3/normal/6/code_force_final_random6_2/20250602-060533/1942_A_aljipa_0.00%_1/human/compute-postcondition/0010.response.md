Output State: **t is an integer larger than 0, _ is 2, n is an integer equal to the first integer in the input, k is an integer equal to the second integer in the input, res is a list of integers equal to [1] * n if k equals n, or range(n) if k equals 1, or [-1] otherwise, stdin is empty**

The code block consists of two lines. The first line assigns the values of the input integers to `n` and `k`. Since `stdin` is empty, this line does not affect the state of `stdin`. The second line assigns a new value to `res` based on the values of `n` and `k`. If `k` equals `n`, `res` becomes a list of `n` ones. If `k` equals 1, `res` becomes a list of integers from 0 to `n-1`. Otherwise, `res` becomes a list containing only -1. The values of `t` and `_` are not affected by the code block.
