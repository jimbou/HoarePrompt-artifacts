Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly handles the three possible cases for the number of sorted cyclic shifts (k):

1. If k equals n, it generates a list of n ones, which satisfies the condition that all cyclic shifts are sorted.
2. If k equals 1, it generates a list of numbers from 0 to n-1, which satisfies the condition that exactly one cyclic shift is sorted.
3. If k is neither 1 nor n, it generates a list containing a single -1, indicating that there is no valid array.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible inputs according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
