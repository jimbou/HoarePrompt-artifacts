To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `steps` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Since `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, we can conclude that `t` must be greater than 0.

The variable `steps` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop, so we can set its initial value to 0.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and greater than 0, `steps` is 0, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of four lines, each containing two integers `x_i`, `y_i` (-1000 <= `x_i`, `y_i` <= 1000)**
