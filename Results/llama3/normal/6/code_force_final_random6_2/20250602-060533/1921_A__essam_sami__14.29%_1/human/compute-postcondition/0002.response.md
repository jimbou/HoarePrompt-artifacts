Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and greater than 0, steps is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of four lines, each containing two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000), a is an integer, b is an integer, c is an integer, d is an integer, e is an integer, f is an integer, g is an integer, h is an integer, n is an integer, x is an integer**

The code reads four lines of input from stdin, each containing two integers, and assigns them to the variables a, b, c, d, e, f, g, and h. It then calculates the values of n and x based on these variables. The values of t and steps remain unchanged. Stdin now contains t-1 test cases.
