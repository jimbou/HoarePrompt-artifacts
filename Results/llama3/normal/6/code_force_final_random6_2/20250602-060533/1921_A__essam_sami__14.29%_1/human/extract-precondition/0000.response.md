Precondition: **stdin contains one integer t (1 <= t <= 100) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of four lines, each containing two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000), which are the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and positive area.**
