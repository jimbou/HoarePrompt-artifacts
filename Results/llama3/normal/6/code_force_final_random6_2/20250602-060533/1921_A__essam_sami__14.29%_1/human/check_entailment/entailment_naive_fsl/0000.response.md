Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input coordinates are not in the order of (a, b), (c, d), (e, f), (g, h) where (a, b) and (e, f) are the coordinates of the same corner of the square, and (c, d) and (g, h) are the coordinates of the same corner of the square. 

For example, if the input is:

3
1 2
1 5
4 2
4 5

The program will calculate the distance between (1, 2) and (1, 5) which is 9, and the distance between (4, 2) and (4, 5) which is also 9. However, it will print the smaller of the two distances, which is not the correct area of the square.

The correct program should calculate the distance between all pairs of points and find the maximum distance, which is the length of the diagonal of the square. The area of the square can then be calculated as the square of the length of the diagonal divided by 2.
