Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive and greater than 1, steps is 2, stdin is empty, a, b, e, f, g, h are integers, n is the square of the distance between points (a, b) and (e, f), x is the square of the distance between points (c, d) and (g, h), c and d are integers.**

In this output state, the values of `a`, `b`, `e`, `f`, `g`, and `h` are integers, as they were assigned integer values from the input. The values of `n` and `x` are the squares of the distances between the points `(a, b)` and `(e, f)`, and `(c, d)` and `(g, h)`, respectively. The value of `c` and `d` are integers. The value of `t` remains an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive and greater than 1, and the value of `steps` remains 2. The stdin is empty, as all the input values have been read.
