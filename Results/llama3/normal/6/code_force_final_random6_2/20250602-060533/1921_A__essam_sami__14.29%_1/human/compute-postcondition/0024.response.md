Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and greater than or equal to 0, steps is t-1, stdin is empty, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h are integers, n is the square of the distance between points (a, b) and (e, f), x is the square of the distance between points (c, d) and (g, h). If x > n, the square of the distance between points (a, b) and (e, f) which is n is being printed. Otherwise, the square of the distance between points (c, d) and (g, h) which is x is being printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` is still between 1 and 100 inclusive, but it can also be 0 because the loop has finished executing. The value of `steps` is now `t-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The standard input `stdin` is empty because all test cases have been processed. The variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, and `h` are integers, and `n` and `x` are the squares of the distances between points `(a, b)` and `(e, f)`, and points `(c, d)` and `(g, h)`, respectively. The loop has printed the smaller of `n` and `x` for each test case.
