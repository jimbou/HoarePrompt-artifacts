Based on the precondition, the variable `n` is the square of the distance between points `(a, b)` and `(e, f)`. This means that `n` is calculated using the formula for the square of the distance between two points in a 2D plane, which is `(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `e`, and `f` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `n`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `n`.

Output: **n (where n is the square of the distance between points (a, b) and (e, f))**
