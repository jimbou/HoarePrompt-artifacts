Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of four lines, each containing two integers `x_i`, `y_i` (-1000 <= `x_i`, `y_i` <= 1000).
Code of the loop:
for steps in range(t):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    c, d = map(int, input().split())
    e, f = map(int, input().split())
    g, h = map(int, input().split())
    n = (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)
    x = (c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)
    if x > n:
        print(n)
    else:
        print(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and greater than 0, steps is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of four lines, each containing two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000), a is an integer, b is an integer, c is an integer, d is an integer, e is an integer, f is an integer, g is an integer, h is an integer, n is an integer, x is an integer. The value of n is printed if x is greater than n, otherwise the value of x which is an integer less than or equal to n is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and greater than 0, steps is 1, stdin is empty, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h are integers, n is the square of the distance between points (a, b) and (e, f), x is the square of the distance between points (c, d) and (g, h). If x > n, the square of the distance between points (a, b) and (e, f) which is n is being printed. Otherwise, the square of the distance between points (c, d) and (g, h) which is x is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive and greater than 1, steps is 2, stdin is empty, a, b, e, f, g, h are integers, n is the square of the distance between points (a, b) and (e, f), x is the square of the distance between points (c, d) and (g, h), c and d are integers. If x > n, the square of the distance between points (a, b) and (e, f) which is n is being printed. Otherwise, the square of the distance between points (c, d) and (g, h) which is x is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
