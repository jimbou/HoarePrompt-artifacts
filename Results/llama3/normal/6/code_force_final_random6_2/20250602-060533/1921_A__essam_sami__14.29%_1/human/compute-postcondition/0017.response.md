The only variable in the loop head is variable `steps` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `steps` and `t`. If `steps` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `steps` is 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and greater than 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time `steps` is 2 and `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive and greater than 1, steps is 2, stdin is empty, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h are integers, n is the square of the distance between points (a, b) and (e, f), x is the square of the distance between points (c, d) and (g, h). If x > n, the square of the distance between points (a, b) and (e, f) which is n is being printed. Otherwise, the square of the distance between points (c, d) and (g, h) which is x is being printed.**
