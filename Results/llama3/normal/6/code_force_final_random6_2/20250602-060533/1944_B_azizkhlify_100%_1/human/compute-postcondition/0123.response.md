Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is equal to `n + 2`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a[i - 1] - 1` is equal to the value at index `a[i - 1] - 1` in `l` plus `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is either 2 if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` was 1 or remains unchanged plus 1 if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` was not 1, `re` is equal to `k` if the value at index `a[i - 1] - 1` in `l` is 1, `ul` is equal to `ur`, `ur` is either 1 if `r[a[i - 1] - 1]` is not equal to 2 or 3 if `r[a[i - 1] - 1]` is equal to 2, `res` is a list containing all values of `a[i - 1]` appended to its original value, and `stdin` contains 2 inputs: an integer and a second integer.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `r` at index `a[i] - 1` is incremented by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The value of `r` at index `a[i] - 1` is now either 2 if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` was 1 or remains unchanged plus 1 if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` was not 1. The stdin still contains 2 inputs: an integer and a second integer.
