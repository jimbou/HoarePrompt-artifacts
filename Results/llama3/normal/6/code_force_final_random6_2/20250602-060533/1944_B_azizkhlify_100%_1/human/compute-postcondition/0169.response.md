To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the loop head variables, which are `i` and `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 2, and `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2**
