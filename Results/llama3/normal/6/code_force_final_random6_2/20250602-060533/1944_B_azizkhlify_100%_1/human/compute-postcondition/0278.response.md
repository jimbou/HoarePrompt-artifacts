Output: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `i` is 2, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of zeros except at index `a[i - 1] - 1` which is `n`, `r` is a list of zeros except at index `a[i] - 1` which is `n`, `k` is 2 * k and its current value is not zero. If `re` equals `k`, then if `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1, `res` contains the second element of the list `a` and `re` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `res` and `re`. In this case, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `re` is not equal to `k`, no changes are made to `res` and `re`, and the second element of the list `a` is printed**
