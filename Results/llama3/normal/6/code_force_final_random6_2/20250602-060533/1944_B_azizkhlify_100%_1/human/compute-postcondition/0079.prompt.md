Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index `a[i]` - 1 is 0 if the value at index `a[i]` - 1 in `l` was 2, otherwise it remains unchanged, `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index `a[i]` - 1 is increased by 1 if the value at index `a[i]` - 1 in `l` was 2, otherwise it remains unchanged. If `k` is non-zero, then `re` is equal to `k` if the value at index `a[i]` - 1 in `l` is 1, `ul` is 2 * `k` if `ul` equals `k` times 2, otherwise it remains 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is a list containing the values of `a[i]` appended to its original value, and `i` is `n` - 1. If `re` is equal to `k`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `re`, `ul`, `ur`, and `res` remain unchanged. If `k` is zero, then the values of `re`, `ul`, `ur`, and `res` remain unchanged. , nothing is printed
Code of the loop:
for i in res:
    print(i, end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index `a[i]` - 1 is 0 if the value at index `a[i]` - 1 in `l` was 2, otherwise it remains unchanged, `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index `a[i]` - 1 is increased by 1 if the value at index `a[i]` - 1 in `l` was 2, otherwise it remains unchanged. If `k` is non-zero, then `re` is equal to `k` if the value at index `a[i]` - 1 in `l` is 1, `ul` is 2 * `k` if `ul` equals `k` times 2, otherwise it remains 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is a list containing at least one value of `a[i]` appended to its original value, and `i` is `n` - 1. If `re` is equal to `k`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `re`, `ul`, `ur`, and `res` remain unchanged. If `k` is zero, then the values of `re`, `ul`, `ur`, and `res` remain unchanged, and the value of `i` which is `n` - 1 is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index `a[i]` - 1 is 0 if the value at index `a[i]` - 1 in `l` was 2, otherwise it remains unchanged, `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index `a[i]` - 1 is increased by 1 if the value at index `a[i]` - 1 in `l` was 2, otherwise it remains unchanged, `re` is equal to `k` if the value at index `a[i]` - 1 in `l` is 1, `ul` is 2 * `k` if `ul` equals `k` times 2, otherwise it remains 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is a list containing at least two values of `a[i]` appended to its original value, and `i` is the second value in the list `res`, and the second value in the list `res` which is `i` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index `a[i]` - 1 is 0 if the value at index `a[i]` - 1 in `l` was 2, otherwise it remains unchanged, `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index `a[i]` - 1 is increased by 1 if the value at index `a[i]` - 1 in `l` was 2, otherwise it remains unchanged, `re` is equal to `k` if the value at index `a[i]` - 1 in `l` is 1, `ul` is 2 * `k` if `ul` equals `k` times 2, otherwise it remains 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is a list containing at least three values of `a[i]` appended to its original value, and `i` is the third value in the list `res`, and the third value in the list `res` which is `i` is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
