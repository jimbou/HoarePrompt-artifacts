Based on the precondition, we know that `i` is equal to 2 * n, and `n` is greater than 0. This means that `i` is an even number greater than 0.

The print statement is printing the value of `a[i]` twice, with a space in between, using the `end=' '` argument.

Since `i` is an even number, `a[i]` will be an element of the list `a` at an even index.

Therefore, the output will be the value of the element at index `i` (which is 2 * n) in the list `a`, printed twice with a space in between.

Output: **a[2*n] a[2*n]**
