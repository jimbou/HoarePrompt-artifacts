The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. At the for the `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is 0 if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` was 2, otherwise it remains unchanged, `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is increased by 1 if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` was 2, otherwise it remains unchanged, `re` is 0, `ul` is 2 if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` was 2, otherwise it remains 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 2**
