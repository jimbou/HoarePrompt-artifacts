Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop has finished executing, and all elements in the list `res` have been printed. The value of `i` is the last element in the list `res`. The current values of `ul` and `ur` are not equal.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        r[a[i] - 1] = 0
        ur += 2
    if ul == ur:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *i is the last element in the list res, n is greater than 0 and i is equal to 2 * n - 1. If ul is equal to ur, then ul and ur are equal. If r[a[i] - 1] is 2, then ur is incremented by 2 and a[i] which is equal to a[2 * n - 1] is printed twice, separated by a space. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If ul is not equal to ur, then ul and ur are not equal. If r[a[i] - 1] is 2, then ur is incremented by 2 and a[i] which is equal to a[2 * n - 1] is printed twice, separated by a space.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is equal to 2 * n + 1, `n` is greater than 0. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, then if `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, `a[2 * n + 1]` is printed twice, `r[a[2 * n + 1] - 1]` is 0, and `ur` is increased by 2. Otherwise, no changes are made and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is equal to 2 * n, `n` is greater than 0. If `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, then `r[a[2*n] - 1]` is 0, `ur` is increased by 2, and `a[2*n]` is printed twice. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
