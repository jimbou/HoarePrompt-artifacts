Output: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `k` is an integer, `re` is 0, `res` is an empty list. If the value at index `a[i] - 1` in list `l` is 2, then `ul` is 2, `ur` is 0, and the value at index `a[0] - 1` in list `l` is 0, and the value at index `a[0]` in list `r` is 0. Otherwise, the values of `ul`, `ur`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged. If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made. The element at index `i` of list `a` which is `a[2]` is printed twice with a space in between.**
