Output: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is 0 if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` was 2, otherwise it remains unchanged, `r` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is either 0 if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` was 2 or remains unchanged if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` was not 2, `re` is equal to `k` if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` is 1, `ul` is equal to `ur`, `ur` is either 0 if `r[a[i] - 1]` is not equal to 2 or 2 if `r[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 2, `res` is a list containing all values of `a[i]` appended to its original value, and `i` is equal to `2 * n`. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, then if `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0, `ur` is 2, and `res` is a list containing all values of `a[i]` appended to its original value, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, then `ul` is equal to `ur` and `ur` is either 0 if `r[a[i] - 1]` is not equal to 2 or 2 if `r[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 2, and nothing is printed**
