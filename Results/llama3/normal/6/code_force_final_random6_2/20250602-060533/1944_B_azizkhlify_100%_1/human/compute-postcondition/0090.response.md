The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `2 * n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is an integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is `n + 1` and for the loop to execute again `i` must be less than `2 * n`. Since `i` is `n + 1` and `n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is less than `2 * n`. So the loop can execute again.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is 0 if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` was 2, otherwise it remains unchanged, `r` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is increased by 1 if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` was 2, otherwise it remains unchanged, `re` is equal to `k` if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` is 1, `ul` is equal to `ur`, `ur` is 0 if `r[a[i] - 1]` is not equal to 2, otherwise `ur` is 2, `res` is a list containing all values of `a[i]` appended to its original value, and `i` is equal to `n + 1`.**
