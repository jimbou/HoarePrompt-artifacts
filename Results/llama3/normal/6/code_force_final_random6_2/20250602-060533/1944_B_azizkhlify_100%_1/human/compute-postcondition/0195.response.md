The code snippet modifies the values of `r[a[i] - 1]` and `ur`. The first line sets `r[a[i] - 1]` to 0, and the second line increments `ur` by 2. The value of `a[i]` is printed twice, separated by a space, but this does not affect the state of the variables.

Output State: **i is the last element in the list res, n is greater than 0 and i is equal to 2 * n - 1, ul and ur are not equal, r[a[i] - 1] is 0, ur is incremented by 2, a[i] which is equal to a[2 * n - 1] is printed twice, separated by a space.**
