Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index `a[i]` - 1 is 0 if the value at index `a[i]` - 1 in `l` was 2, otherwise it remains unchanged, `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index `a[i]` - 1 is increased by 1 if the value at index `a[i]` - 1 in `l` was 2, otherwise it remains unchanged, `re` is equal to `k` if the value at index `a[i]` - 1 in `l` is 1, `ul` is 2 * `k` if `ul` equals `k` times 2, otherwise it remains 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is a list containing all values of `a[i]` appended to its original value, and `i` is the last value in the list `res`, and the last value in the list `res` which is `i` is printed. The current value of `ul` is not equal to the current value of `ur`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        r[a[i] - 1] = 0
        ur += 2
    if ul == ur:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is 0 if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` was 2, otherwise it remains unchanged, `r` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is increased by 1 if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` was 2, otherwise it remains unchanged, `re` is equal to `k` if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` is 1, `ul` is equal to `ur`, `ur` is 0 if `r[a[i] - 1]` is not equal to 2, otherwise `ur` is 2, `res` is a list containing all values of `a[i]` appended to its original value, and `i` is equal to `n`. If `ul` equals `ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is 0 if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` was 2, otherwise it remains unchanged, `r` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is either 0 if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` was 2 or remains unchanged if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` was not 2, `re` is equal to `k` if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` is 1, `ul` is equal to `ur`, `ur` is either 0 if `r[a[i] - 1]` is not equal to 2 or 2 if `r[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 2, `res` is a list containing all values of `a[i]` appended to its original value, and `i` is equal to `n + 1`. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is 0 if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` was 2, otherwise it remains unchanged, `r` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is either 0 if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` was 2 or remains unchanged if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` was not 2, `re` is equal to `k` if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` is 1, `ul` is equal to `ur`, `ur` is either 0 if `r[a[i] - 1]` is not equal to 2 or 2 if `r[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 2, `res` is a list containing all values of `a[i]` appended to its original value, and `i` is equal to `n + 2. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, then if `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0, `ur` is 2, and `res` is a list containing all values of `a[i]` appended to its original value, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
