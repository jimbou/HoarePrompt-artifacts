The code prints the value of `a[i]` twice, separated by a space, without appending a newline character at the end.

Since `i` is `n + 1`, and `n` is at least 2, `i` is at least 3. Therefore, `a[i]` refers to the element at index `i` in the list `a`.

However, the exact value of `a[i]` cannot be determined without knowing the contents of the list `a`. Nevertheless, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **a[i] a[i] (where a[i] is the element at index i in the list a, and i is n + 1)**
