Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer and at least 2, i is 2, ul is 0, ur is 0, a is a list of integers, l is a list of zeros except at index a[i - 1] - 1 which is n, r is a list of zeros except at index a[i] - 1 which is n, k is 2 * k and its current value is not zero. If re equals k and l[a[i] - 1] equals 1, then res contains the second element of the list a and re is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to res and re. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if re equals k. Otherwise, the program continues its execution.***
