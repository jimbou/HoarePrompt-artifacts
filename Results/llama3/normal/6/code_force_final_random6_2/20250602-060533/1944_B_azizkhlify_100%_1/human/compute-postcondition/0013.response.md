To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states accordingly.


The loop head is `for i in range(n, 2 * n):`. The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. If `i` is less than `2 * n`, the loop can execute again.


At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1.


State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is the number of occurrences of `a[i]` in `a` for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index `a[n] - 1` is increased by 1, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is `n + 2`.**
