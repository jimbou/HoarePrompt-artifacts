Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer and at least 1, `i` is `n`, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of zeros except at index `a[i - 1] - 1` which is `n`, `r` is a list of zeros except at index `a[i] - 1` which is `n`, `re` is 0, `k` is `2 * k`. If `k` is not zero, then if `re` equals `k`, and `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1, `res` contains the last element of the list `a` and `re` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `res` and `re`. In this case, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `re` is not equal to `k`, no changes are made to `res` and `re`.***
