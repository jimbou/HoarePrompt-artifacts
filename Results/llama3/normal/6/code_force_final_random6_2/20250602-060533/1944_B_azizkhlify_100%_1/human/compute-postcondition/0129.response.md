Output: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a[i - 1] - 1` is equal to the value at index `a[i - 1] - 1` in `l` plus `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is either 0 if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` was 2 or remains unchanged if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` was not 2, `re` is equal to `k` if the value at index `a[i - 1] - 1` in `l` is 1, `ul` is equal to `ur`, `ur` is either 0 if `r[a[i - 1] - 1]` is not equal to 2 or 2 if `r[a[i - 1] - 1]` is equal to 2, `res` is a list containing all values of `a[i - 1]` appended to its original value, and `stdin` contains 2 inputs: an integer and a second integer. The current value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, and this is printed: a[i] which is the value at index i in the list a, and a[i] which is the value at index i in the list a, separated by a space**
