The code prints the value of `a[i]` twice, separated by a space, without a newline at the end.

Since `i` is 0, `a[i]` refers to the first element of the list `a`. However, the exact value of the first element of `a` is not provided in the initial state.

Output: **[a[0], a[0]] (where a[0] is the first element of the list a)**
