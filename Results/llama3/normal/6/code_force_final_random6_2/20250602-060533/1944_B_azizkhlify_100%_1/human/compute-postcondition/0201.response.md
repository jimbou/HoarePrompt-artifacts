The code prints the element at index `i` of the list `a` twice, separated by a space, without a newline at the end.
Since `i` is equal to `2 * n + 1`, the element at index `i` of the list `a` is `a[2 * n + 1]`.
Output: **a[2 * n + 1] (the element at index 2 * n + 1 of the list a) a[2 * n + 1] (the element at index 2 * n + 1 of the list a)**
