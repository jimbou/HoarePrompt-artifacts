Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is 2 if the value at index a[i] - 1 in l was 1, otherwise it remains unchanged, `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is either 0 if the value at index a[i] - 1 in l was 2 or remains unchanged if the value at index a[i] - 1 in l was not 2, `re` is equal to k if the value at index a[i] - 1 in l is 2, `ul` is equal to ur, `ur` is either 0 if r[a[i] - 1] is not equal to 2 or 2 if r[a[i] - 1] is equal to 2, `res` is a list containing all values of a[i] appended to its original value, and `stdin` contains 2 inputs: an integer and a second integer**

In natural language, the output state is: The value at index a[i] - 1 in list l is incremented by 1. If the value at index a[i] - 1 in l was 1, it becomes 2, otherwise it remains unchanged. The value of re is updated to k if the value at index a[i] - 1 in l is 2. The values of the other variables remain the same.
