Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer and at least 1, `i` equals `n`, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of zeros except at index `a[i - 1] - 1` which is `n`, `r` is a list of zeros except at index `a[i] - 1` which is `n`, `re` is 0, `k` is `2 * k` and its current value is not zero.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
        print(a[i], end=' ')
        re += 1
        res.append(a[i])
    if re == k:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is a positive integer and at least 1, i is 0, ul is 0, ur is 0, a is a list of integers, l is a list of zeros except at index a[i - 1] - 1 which is n, r is a list of zeros except at index a[i] - 1 which is n, k is 2 * k and its current value is not zero. If re is equal to k, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If l[a[i] - 1] is 1, then res is a list containing the first element of a and re is 1. Otherwise, the state of res and re remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is a positive integer and at least 1, `i` is 1, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of zeros except at index `a[i - 1] - 1` which is `n`, `r` is a list of zeros except at index `a[i] - 1` which is `n`, `k` is 2 * k and its current value is not zero. If `re` equals `k`, then if `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1, `res` contains the second element of the list `a` and `re` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `res` and `re`. In this case, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `re` is not equal to `k`, no changes are made to `res` and `re`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is a positive integer and at least 2, i is 2, ul is 0, ur is 0, a is a list of integers, l is a list of zeros except at index a[i - 1] - 1 which is n, r is a list of zeros except at index a[i] - 1 which is n, k is 2 * k and its current value is not zero. If re equals k and l[a[i] - 1] equals 1, then res contains the second element of the list a and re is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to res and re. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if re equals k. Otherwise, the program continues its execution.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
