The code prints the value of `a[i]`, where `a` is a list and `i` is the index of the element to be printed. Since `i` is 0, the code prints the first element of the list `a`. The `end=' '` argument in the `print` function means that a space will be printed after the value of `a[i]`.

Output: **the first element of the list a**
