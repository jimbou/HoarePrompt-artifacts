Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is the number of occurrences of `a[i]` in `a` for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of n zeros, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of n integers, `i` is `n`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `l` will contain the frequency of each number in the list `a`, where the index of each frequency corresponds to the number in `a` minus one. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The loop variable `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations.
