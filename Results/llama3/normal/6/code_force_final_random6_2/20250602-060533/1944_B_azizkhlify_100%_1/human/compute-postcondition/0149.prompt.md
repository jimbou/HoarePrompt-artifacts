Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `2 * n`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a[i - 1] - 1` is equal to the value at index `a[i - 1] - 1` in `l` plus `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is either 0 if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` was 2 or remains unchanged if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` was not 2, `re` is equal to `k` if the value at index `a[i - 1] - 1` in `l` is 1, `ul` is equal to `ur`, `ur` is either 0 if `r[a[i - 1] - 1]` is not equal to 2 or 2 if `r[a[i - 1] - 1]` is equal to 2, `res` is a list containing all values of `a[i - 1]` appended to its original value, and `stdin` contains 2 inputs: an integer and a second integer.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

- The value of `n` remains the same as it was before the loop started.
- The value of `i` is now equal to `2 * n`, indicating that the loop has executed `n` times.
- The value of `k` remains unchanged.
- The list `a` remains unchanged.
- The list `l` has been updated such that the value at index `a[i - 1] - 1` is now equal to the value at index `a[i - 1] - 1` in `l` plus `n`. This means that each element in `l` has been incremented by `n`.
- The list `r` has been updated such that the value at index `a[i] - 1` is either 0 if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` was 2 or remains unchanged if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` was not 2.
- The value of `re` is equal to `k` if the value at index `a[i - 1] - 1` in `l` is 1.
- The values of `ul` and `ur` remain unchanged.
- The list `res` now contains all values of `a[i - 1]` appended to its original value.
- The input `stdin` still contains 2 inputs: an integer and a second integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        l[a[i] - 1] = 0
        ul += 2
    if ul == k * 2:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a[i - 1] - 1` is equal to the value at index `a[i - 1] - 1` in `l` plus `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is either 0 if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` was 2 or remains unchanged if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` was not 2, `re` is equal to `k` if the value at index `a[i - 1] - 1` in `l` is 1, `ul` is either equal to `ur` or equal to `ur` plus 2, `ur` is either 0 if `r[a[i - 1] - 1]` is not equal to 2 or 2 if `r[a[i - 1] - 1]` is equal to 2, `res` is a list containing all values of `a[i - 1]` appended to its original value, and `stdin` contains 2 inputs: an integer and a second integer. If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a[i - 1] - 1` is equal to the value at index `a[i - 1] - 1` in `l` plus `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is either 0 if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` was 2 or remains unchanged if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` was not 2, `re` is equal to `k` if the value at index `a[i - 1] - 1` in `l` is 1, `ul` is either equal to `ur` or equal to `ur` plus 2, `ur` is either 0 if `r[a[i - 1] - 1]` is not equal to 2 or 2 if `r[a[i - 1] - 1]` is equal to 2, `res` is a list containing all values of `a[i - 1]` appended to its original value, and `stdin` contains 2 inputs: an integer and a second integer. If `l[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 2, then `l` is updated to have the value at index `a[i] - 1` equal to 0 and `ul` is either equal to `ur` plus 2 or equal to `ur` plus 4. If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index `a[i - 1] - 1` is equal to the value at index `a[i - 1] - 1` in `l` plus `n`, `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is either 0 if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` was 2 or remains unchanged if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` was not 2, `re` is equal to `k` if the value at index `a[i - 1] - 1` in `l` is 1, `ul` is either equal to `ur` plus 2 or equal to `ur` plus 4, `ur` is either 0 if `r[a[i - 1] - 1]` is not equal to 2 or 2 if `r[a[i - 1] - 1]` is equal to 2, `res` is a list containing all values of `a[i - 1]` appended to its original value, and stdin contains 2 inputs: an integer and a second integer. If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `l[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 2, then the value of `a[i]` is printed twice, separated by a space, `l[a[i] - 1]` is updated to 0, and `ul` is either equal to `ur` plus 2 or equal to `ur` plus 4.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
