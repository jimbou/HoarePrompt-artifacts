Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2. If `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, then `re` is incremented by 1, `res` contains a new element which is `a[2]`, and the value of `a[2]` is being printed. If `re` equals `k`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute.***
