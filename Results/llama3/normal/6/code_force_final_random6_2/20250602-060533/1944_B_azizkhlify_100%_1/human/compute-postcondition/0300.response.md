The code prints the value of `a[i]` twice, separated by a space, without appending a newline character at the end.

Since `i` is equal to `n`, and `n` is at least 1, `a[i]` refers to the last element of the list `a`.

However, the exact value of the last element of `a` is not provided in the precondition. Therefore, we can't determine the exact numerical value that will be printed.

But we can describe the output based on the given information.

Output: **the last element of the list a, the last element of the list a**
