Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. 

For example, consider the input:

4 2
1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4

The program will output:

1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4

However, this is not a valid solution because the XOR of the elements in the left and right arrays is not equal. The XOR of the elements in the left array is 0 (1 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 4 = 0), but the XOR of the elements in the right array is also 0 (1 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 4 = 0), which means that the XOR of the elements in the left and right arrays is not equal.

The program does not correctly handle the case where the XOR of the elements in the left and right arrays is not equal. It simply prints the elements of the left and right arrays without checking if the XOR of the elements is equal.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
