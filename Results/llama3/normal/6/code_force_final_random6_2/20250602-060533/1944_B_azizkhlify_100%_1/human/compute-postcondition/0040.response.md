Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `k` is 2 * `k` - `ul`, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index `a[i]` - 1 is 0 if the value at index `a[i]` - 1 in `l` was 2, otherwise it remains unchanged, `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index `a[i]` - 1 is increased by 1 if the value at index `a[i]` - 1 in `l` was 2, otherwise it remains unchanged, `re` is 0, `ul` is 2 * `k` if `ul` equals `k` times 2, otherwise it remains 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is `n`, and if the value at index `a[i]` - 1 in `l` was 2, the value of `a[i]` is printed twice separated by a space.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated to be twice its original value minus the value of `ul`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on the lists `l` and `r` still hold. The value of `ul` is still dependent on whether it was equal to `k` times 2, and the value of `i` is still `n`. The printing of the value of `a[i]` twice separated by a space still occurs if the value at index `a[i]` - 1 in `l` was 2.
