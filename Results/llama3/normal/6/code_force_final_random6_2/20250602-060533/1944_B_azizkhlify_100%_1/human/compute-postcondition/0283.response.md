Output State: **n is a positive integer and at least 1, i is n, ul is 0, ur is 0, res is a list of integers, l is a list of zeros except at index a[i - 1] - 1 which is n, r is a list of zeros except at index a[i] - 1 which is n, k is 2 * k and its current value is not zero. If re equals k, then if l[a[i] - 1] equals 1, res contains the last element of the list a and re is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to res and re. In this case, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If re is not equal to k, no changes are made to res and re.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop will continue to execute until it has iterated over the entire list `a`. If the value of `re` equals `k` at any point during the execution, the loop will break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1, the last element of the list `a` will be appended to the list `res` and `re` will be incremented by 1. If `re` is not equal to `k`, no changes will be made to `res` and `re`. The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body will remain unchanged.
