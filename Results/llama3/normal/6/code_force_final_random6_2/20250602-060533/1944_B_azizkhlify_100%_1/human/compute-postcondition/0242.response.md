Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer and at least 1, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `k` is an integer, `re` is 0, `res` is an empty list. If `ul` is equal to `k` times 2, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, then `ul` is 2, `ur` is 0, `l` is a list of zeros except at index `a[i - 1] - 1` which is `n`, and `r` is a list of zeros except at index `a[i] - 1` which is 0. Otherwise, the values of `ul`, `ur`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged.***
