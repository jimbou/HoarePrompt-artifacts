Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is 0 if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` was 2, otherwise it remains unchanged, `r` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is increased by 1 if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` was 2, otherwise it remains unchanged, `re` is equal to `k` if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` is 1, `ul` is equal to `ur`, `ur` is 0 if `r[a[i] - 1]` is not equal to 2, otherwise `ur` is 2, `res` is a list containing all values of `a[i]` appended to its original value, and `i` is equal to `n`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables remain unchanged, but the program execution breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement.
