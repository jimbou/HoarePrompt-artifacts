Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `2 * n`, `k` is a non-zero integer equal to `2 * k - ul`, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a[i - 1] - 1` is equal to the value at index `a[i - 1] - 1` in `l` plus `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is either 0 if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` was 2 or remains unchanged if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` was not 2, `re` is equal to `k` if the value at index `a[i - 1] - 1` in `l` is 1, `ul` is either equal to `ur` or equal to `ur` plus 2, `ur` is either 0 if `r[a[i - 1] - 1]` is not equal to 2 or 2 if `r[a[i - 1] - 1]` is equal to 2, `res` is a list containing all values of `a[i - 1]` appended to its original value, and `stdin` contains 2 inputs: an integer and a second integer. The current value of `k` is non-zero.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
        print(a[i], end=' ')
        re += 1
        res.append(a[i])
    if re == k:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. If `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, then `a[i]` has been printed, `re` is 1 greater than its original value, and `res` contains `a[i]`. If `re` is equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1. If `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1, then `re` is incremented by 1 and `res` contains a new element which is the value of `a[1]`. If `re` equals `k`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2. If `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, then `re` is incremented by 1, `res` contains a new element which is `a[2]`, and the value of `a[2]` is being printed. If `re` equals `k`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
