#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4, 1 <= k <= floor(n/2)). The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} (1 <= a_i <= n). Every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 * 10^4.
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        l = [0] * n
        
        r = [0] * n
        
        re = ul = ur = 0
        
        res = []
        
        for i in range(n):
            l[a[i] - 1] += 1
        
        for i in range(n, 2 * n):
            r[a[i] - 1] += 1
        
        for i in range(n):
            if l[a[i] - 1] == 2:
                print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
                l[a[i] - 1] = 0
                ul += 2
            if ul == k * 2:
                break
        
        k = 2 * k - ul
        
        if k:
            for i in range(n):
                if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
                    print(a[i], end=' ')
                    re += 1
                    res.append(a[i])
                if re == k:
                    break
        
        print()
        
        for i in res:
            print(i, end=' ')
        
        if ul != ur:
            for i in range(n, 2 * n):
                if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
                    print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
                    r[a[i] - 1] = 0
                    ur += 2
                if ul == ur:
                    break
        
        print()
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing, and all elements in the list `res` have been printed. The value of `i` is the last element in the list `res`. The current values of `ul` and `ur` are equal, and a new line is printed. The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `re` are unchanged.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains 2n integers. The function then processes the integers, printing pairs of identical integers until it reaches a total of k pairs. If there are remaining integers, it prints them individually. The function repeats this process for each test case, printing the results in a specific format.
