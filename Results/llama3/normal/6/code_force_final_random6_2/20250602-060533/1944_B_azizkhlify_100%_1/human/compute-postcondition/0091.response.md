The code prints the value of `a[i]` twice, separated by a space, where `i` is equal to `n + 1`. However, since `i` is out of bounds of the list `a` (which has `n` elements, indexed from 0 to `n-1`), this will result in an "IndexError: list index out of range" exception.

Output: **IndexError: list index out of range**
