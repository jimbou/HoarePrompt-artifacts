Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index `a[i]` - 1 is 0 if the value at index `a[i]` - 1 in `l` was 2, otherwise it remains unchanged, `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index `a[i]` - 1 is increased by 1 if the value at index `a[i]` - 1 in `l` was 2, otherwise it remains unchanged, `re` is equal to `k` if the value at index `a[i]` - 1 in `l` is 1, `ul` is 2 * `k` if `ul` equals `k` times 2, otherwise it remains 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is a list containing all values of `a[i]` appended to its original value, and `i` is the last value in the list `res`, and the last value in the list `res` which is `i` is printed. The current value of `ul` is not equal to the current value of `ur`.**
