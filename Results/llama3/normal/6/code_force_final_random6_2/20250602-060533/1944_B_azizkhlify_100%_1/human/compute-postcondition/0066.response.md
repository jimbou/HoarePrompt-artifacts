Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index `a[i]` - 1 is 0 if the value at index `a[i]` - 1 in `l` was 2, otherwise it remains unchanged, `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index `a[i]` - 1 is increased by 1 if the value at index `a[i]` - 1 in `l` was 2, otherwise it remains unchanged. If `k` is non-zero, then `re` is equal to `k` if the value at index `a[i]` - 1 in `l` is 1, `ul` is 2 * `k` if `ul` equals `k` times 2, otherwise it remains 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is a list containing the values of `a[i]` appended to its original value, and `i` is `n` - 1. If `re` is equal to `k`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `re`, `ul`, `ur`, and `res` remain unchanged. If `k` is zero, then the values of `re`, `ul`, `ur`, and `res` remain unchanged.**
