Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n + 2`, `ul` and `ur` are not equal, `res` is a list of integers that must have at least as many elements as the length of `res`, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of zeros except at index `a[i - 1] - 1` which is `n`, `r` is a list of zeros except at index `a[i] - 1` which is either 0 or 2, `re` is 0, `k` is `2 * k`. If `ul` equals `ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
