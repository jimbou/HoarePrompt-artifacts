To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for i in range(n, 2 * n):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range `[n, 2 * n)`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `i` is equal to `2 * n + 1`. This means that `i` has already exceeded the upper bound of the range, which is `2 * n`.

To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to decrease `i` by 1, so that it falls within the range again. Therefore, the new value of `i` should be `2 * n`.

The value of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

The other variables (`ul`, `ur`, `r`, `a`) are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is equal to 2 * n, `n` is greater than 0**
