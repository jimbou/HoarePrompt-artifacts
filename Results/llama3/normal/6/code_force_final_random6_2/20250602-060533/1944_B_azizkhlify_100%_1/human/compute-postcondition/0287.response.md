To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the variable `i` and the list `res` because these are the only objects in the loop head.

The loop will execute if `res` is not empty. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `res` to ensure it has at least one element.

State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 1, `i` is `n`, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of zeros except at index `a[i - 1] - 1` which is `n`, `r` is a list of zeros except at index `a[i] - 1` which is `n`, `re` is 0, `k` is `2 * k`, `i` is the first element of the list `res`**
