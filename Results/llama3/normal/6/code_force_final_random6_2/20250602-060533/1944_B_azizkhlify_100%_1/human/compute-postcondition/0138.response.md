Output State: **n is greater than 1, i is 1, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, l is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is 0, r is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is either 0 if the value at index a[i] - 1 in l was 2 or remains unchanged if the value at index a[i] - 1 in l was not 2, re is equal to k if the value at index a[i - 1] - 1 in l is 1, ul is either equal to ur plus 2 or equal to ur plus 4, ur is either 0 if r[a[i - 1] - 1] is not equal to 2 or 2 if r[a[i - 1] - 1] is equal to 2, res is a list containing all values of a[i - 1] appended to its original value, and stdin contains 2 inputs: an integer and a second integer.**
