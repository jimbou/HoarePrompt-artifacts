Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is the number of occurrences of `a[i]` in `a` for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index `a[n] - 1` is increased by 1, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is `n + 1`.**

In this output state, the value of `r` at index `a[n] - 1` is increased by 1, because `r[a[i] - 1] += 1` increments the value at index `a[i] - 1` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
