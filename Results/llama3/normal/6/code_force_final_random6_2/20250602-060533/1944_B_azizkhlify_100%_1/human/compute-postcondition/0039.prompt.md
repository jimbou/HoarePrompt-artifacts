Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is the number of occurrences of `a[i]` in `a` for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range `n`, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is `2 * n`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        l[a[i] - 1] = 0
        ul += 2
    if ul == k * 2:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is 0 if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` was 2, otherwise it remains unchanged, `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is increased by 1, `re` is 0, `ul` is 2 if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` was 2, otherwise it remains 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 0, and if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` was 2, the value of `a[i]` is printed twice separated by a space. If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is 0 if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` was 2, otherwise it remains unchanged, `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is increased by 1 if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` was 2, otherwise it remains unchanged, `re` is 0, `ul` is 2 if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` was 2, otherwise it remains 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 1. If `ul` equals `k * 2`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer greater than 2, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, l is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is 0 if the value at index a[i] - 1 in l was 2, otherwise it remains unchanged, r is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is increased by 1 if the value at index a[i] - 1 in l was 2, otherwise it remains unchanged, re is 0, ul is 4 if the value at index a[i] - 1 in l was 2, otherwise it remains 2, ur is 0, res is an empty list, i is 2, and if the value at index a[i] - 1 in l was 2, the value of a[i] which is a[2] is printed twice with a space in between. If ul equals k times 2, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
