Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. If `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, then `a[i]` has been printed, `re` is 1 greater than its original value, and `res` contains `a[i]`. If `re` is equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute.***
