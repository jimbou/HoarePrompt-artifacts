Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `k` is a non-zero integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index `a[i]` - 1 is 0 if the value at index `a[i]` - 1 in `l` was 2, otherwise it remains unchanged, `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index `a[i]` - 1 is increased by 1 if the value at index `a[i]` - 1 in `l` was 2, otherwise it remains unchanged, `re` is 0, `ul` is 2 * `k` if `ul` equals `k` times 2, otherwise it remains 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, and `i` is `n`. The current value of `k` is non-zero.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
        print(a[i], end=' ')
        re += 1
        res.append(a[i])
    if re == k:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is a non-zero integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is 0 if the value at index a[i] - 1 in l was 2, otherwise it remains unchanged, `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is increased by 1 if the value at index a[i] - 1 in l was 2, otherwise it remains unchanged. If the value at index a[i] - 1 in l is 1, then re is 1, ul is 2 * k if ul equals k times 2, otherwise it remains 0, ur is 0, res is a list containing the value of a[i], and i is 0. Otherwise, re, ul, ur, and res remain unchanged. If re is equal to k, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is a non-zero integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is 0 if the value at index a[i] - 1 in l was 2, otherwise it remains unchanged, `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is increased by 1 if the value at index a[i] - 1 in l was 2, otherwise it remains unchanged. If the value at index a[i] - 1 in l is 1, then re is 1 plus its original value, ul is 2 * k if ul equals k times 2, otherwise it remains 0, ur is 0, res is a list containing the value of a[i] appended to its original value, and i is 1. If re is equal to k, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of re, ul, ur, and res remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer greater than 0, k is a non-zero integer, a is a list of integers, l is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is 0 if the value at index a[i] - 1 in l was 2, otherwise it remains unchanged, r is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is increased by 1 if the value at index a[i] - 1 in l was 2, otherwise it remains unchanged. If the value at index a[i] - 1 in l is 1, then re is 1 plus its original value, ul is 2 * k if ul equals k times 2, otherwise it remains 0, ur is 0, res is a list containing the value of a[i] appended to its original value, and i is 2. If re is equal to k, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of re, ul, ur, and res remain unchanged. If the value at index a[i] - 1 in l is 1, the value of a[i] where i is 2 is being printed, re is 1 plus its original value, and res is a list containing the value of a[i] appended to its original value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
