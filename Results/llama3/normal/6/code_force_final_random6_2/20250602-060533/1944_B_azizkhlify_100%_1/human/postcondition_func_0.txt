This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains 2n integers. The function then processes the integers, printing pairs of identical integers until it reaches a total of k pairs. If there are remaining integers, it prints them individually. The function repeats this process for each test case, printing the results in a specific format.
