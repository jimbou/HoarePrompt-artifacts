Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer and at least 1, i is 0, ul is 0, ur is 0, a is a list of integers, l is a list of zeros except at index a[i - 1] - 1 which is n, r is a list of zeros except at index a[i] - 1 which is n, k is 2 * k and its current value is not zero. If re is equal to k, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If l[a[i] - 1] is 1, then res is a list containing the first element of a and re is 1. Otherwise, the state of res and re remains unchanged.***
