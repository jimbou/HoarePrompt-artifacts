Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 1, `i` is `n`, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of zeros except at index `a[i - 1] - 1` which is `n`, `r` is a list of zeros except at index `a[i] - 1` which is `n`, `re` is 0, `k` is `2 * k`**.

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated to be twice its original value minus `ul`, which is 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
