Postcondition: ***`i` is equal to 2 * n + 1, `n` is greater than 0. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, then if `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, `a[2 * n + 1]` is printed twice, `r[a[2 * n + 1] - 1]` is 0, and `ur` is increased by 2. Otherwise, no changes are made and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, no changes are made.***
