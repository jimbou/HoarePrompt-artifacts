To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is a positive integer and at least 1.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 1, `i` is 1, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of zeros except at index `a[i - 1] - 1` which is `n`, `r` is a list of zeros except at index `a[i] - 1` which is `n`, `k` is 2 * k and its current value is not zero, `res` and `re` remain unchanged**
