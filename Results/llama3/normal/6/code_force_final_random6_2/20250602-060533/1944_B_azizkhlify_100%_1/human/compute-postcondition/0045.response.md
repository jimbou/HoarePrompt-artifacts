Output: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is a non-zero integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index `a[i]` - 1 is 0 if the value at index `a[i]` - 1 in `l` was 2, otherwise it remains unchanged, `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index `a[i]` - 1 is increased by 1 if the value at index `a[i]` - 1 in `l` was 2, otherwise it remains unchanged, `re` is 0, `ul` is 2 * `k` if `ul` equals `k` times 2, otherwise it remains 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, and `i` is 0. The current value of `l` at index `a[i]` - 1 is 1, and the value of `a[i]` is being printed.**
