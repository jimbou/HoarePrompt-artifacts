The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `2 * n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`, `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is `n + 1` and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than `n / 2`. 
State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n + 1`, `ul` and `ur` are not equal, `res` is a list of integers that must have at least as many elements as the length of `res`, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of zeros except at index `a[i - 1] - 1` which is `n`, `r` is a list of zeros except at index `a[i] - 1` which is either 0 or 2, `re` is 0, `k` is `2 * k`, and the last element of the list `res` which is `i` is being printed.**
