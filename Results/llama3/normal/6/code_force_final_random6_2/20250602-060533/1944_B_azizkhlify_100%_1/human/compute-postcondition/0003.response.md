Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index `a[0] - 1` is 1 and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of n zeros, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of n integers, `i` is 0**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `l` at index `a[0] - 1` is incremented by 1, and the rest of the variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs.
