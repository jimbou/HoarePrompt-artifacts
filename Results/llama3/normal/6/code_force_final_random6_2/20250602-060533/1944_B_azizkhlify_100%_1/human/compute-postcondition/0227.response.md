To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, because the range starts from `n` and goes up to `2 * n`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 1, `i` is `n`, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of zeros except at index `a[i - 1] - 1` which is `n`, `r` is a list of zeros, `re` is 0, `k` is an integer**
