To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `a` is a list of integers, `l` and `r` are lists of zeros, `re` is 0, `k` is an integer**
