Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is equal to `n`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is equal to the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` plus `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is either 1 if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` was 2 or remains unchanged plus 1 if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` was not 2, `re` is equal to `k` if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` is 1, `ul` is equal to `ur`, `ur` is either 1 if `r[a[i] - 1]` is not equal to 2 or 3 if `r[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 2, `res` is a list containing all values of `a[i]` appended to its original value, and `stdin` contains 2 inputs: an integer and a second integer.**

The value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1. The value at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` is either 2 or not 2. If the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` is 2, then the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `r` is 1. If the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` is not 2, then the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `r` is incremented by 1. The value of `ur` is either 1 if `r[a[i] - 1]` is not equal to 2 or 3 if `r[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 2. The states of the other variables are not affected.
