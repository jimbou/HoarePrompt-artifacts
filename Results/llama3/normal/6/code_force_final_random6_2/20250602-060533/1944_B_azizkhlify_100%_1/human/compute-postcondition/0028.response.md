Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, l is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is 0, r is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is increased by 1, re is 0, ul is 2, ur is 0, res is an empty list, i is 1, and the value of a[i] is printed twice separated by a space.**

In this final state, the value of `l` at index `a[i] - 1` is set to 0, and the value of `ul` is incremented by 2, making it 2. The value of `a[i]` is printed twice separated by a space. All other variables remain unchanged.
