Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, k is a non-zero integer, a is a list of integers, l is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is 0 if the value at index a[i] - 1 in l was 2, otherwise it remains unchanged, r is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is increased by 1 if the value at index a[i] - 1 in l was 2, otherwise it remains unchanged, re is 1 plus its original value, ul is 2 * k if ul equals k times 2, otherwise it remains 0, ur is 0, res is a list containing the value of a[i] appended to its original value, and i is 1.**

The code increments the value of `re` by 1 and appends the value of `a[i]` to the list `res`. The value of `re` is now one more than its original value. The list `res` now contains the value of `a[i]` appended to its original value. The value of `i` remains 1. The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged. The value of `ul` is now 2 * k if it was originally equal to k times 2, otherwise it remains 0. The value of `ur` remains 0.
