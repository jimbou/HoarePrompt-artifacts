Output: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is 0 if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` was 2, otherwise it remains unchanged, `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is increased by 1 if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` was 2, otherwise it remains unchanged, `re` is 0, `ul` is 2 if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` was 2, otherwise it remains 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 2, and the value of `a[i]` which is `a[2]` is printed twice with a space in between**
