To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved in it.

The loop head is `for i in res:`, which means the only object in the loop head is `i` and the list `res`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `res`. If the list `res` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `res` has at least 1 element, and `i` is the first element of the list `res`.

For the loop to execute again, `res` must have at least 2 elements, and `i` must be the second element of the list `res`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 1, `i` is the second element of the list `res`, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of zeros except at index `a[i - 1] - 1` which is `n`, `r` is a list of zeros except at index `a[i] - 1` which is `n`, `re` is 0, `k` is `2 * k`**
