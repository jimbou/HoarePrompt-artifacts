The code prints the value of `a[i]` twice, separated by a space, without appending a newline character at the end.

Since `i` is 2, `a[i]` refers to the third element of the list `a`. The exact value of the third element of `a` is not provided in the precondition, but we can describe it as the third element of the list `a`.

Output: **the third element of the list a, the third element of the list a**
