The `print` statement will print the value of `a[i]` twice, separated by a space, without appending a newline character at the end.

Since `i` is `n + 2`, we need to consider the value of `a` at index `n + 2`. However, the precondition does not provide explicit information about the value of `a` at this index.

Based on the given information, we can only describe the output in terms of the variables and their relationships.

Output: **a[n + 2] a[n + 2] (where a[n + 2] is the value of a at index n + 2)**
