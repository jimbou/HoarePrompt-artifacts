Output: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is the number of occurrences of `a[i]` in `a` for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range `n`, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 0, and the current value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, and the following is printed: the value of `a[i]` which is the first element of the list `a` and is repeated twice and separated by a space**
