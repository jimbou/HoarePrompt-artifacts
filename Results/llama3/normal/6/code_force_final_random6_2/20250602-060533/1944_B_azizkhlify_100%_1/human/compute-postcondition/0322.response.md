Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer and at least 1, `i` is `2 * n`, `ul` equals `ur`, `res` is a list of integers that must have at least as many elements as the length of `res`, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of zeros except at index `a[i - 1] - 1` which is `n`, `r` is a list of zeros except at index `a[i] - 1` which is either 0 or 2, `re` is 0, `k` is `2 * k`. The last element of the list `res` which is `i` is being printed. If `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, then the value of `a[i]` is printed twice separated by a space, and `ur` is increased by 2. If `ul` equals `ur` initially, then no changes are made.***
