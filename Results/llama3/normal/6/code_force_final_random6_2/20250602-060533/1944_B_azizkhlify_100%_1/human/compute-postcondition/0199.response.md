Postcondition: ***i is the last element in the list res, n is greater than 0 and i is equal to 2 * n - 1. If ul is equal to ur, then ul and ur are equal. If r[a[i] - 1] is 2, then ur is incremented by 2 and a[i] which is equal to a[2 * n - 1] is printed twice, separated by a space. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If ul is not equal to ur, then ul and ur are not equal. If r[a[i] - 1] is 2, then ur is incremented by 2 and a[i] which is equal to a[2 * n - 1] is printed twice, separated by a space.***
