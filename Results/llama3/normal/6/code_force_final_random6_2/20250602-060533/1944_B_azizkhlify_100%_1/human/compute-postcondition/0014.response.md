Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is the number of occurrences of `a[i]` in `a` for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index `a[n + 2] - 1` is increased by 1, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is `n + 2`.**

In this output state, the value at index `a[n + 2] - 1` in list `r` is increased by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. Note that `i` is still `n + 2`, which is out of range for list `a` and list `l`, but this does not affect the values of these lists.
