Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `re` is equal to `k` if `l[a[i - 1] - 1]` is 1 for all `i` in the range from 0 to `n - 1`, otherwise `re` is less than `k`, `res` contains all values of `a[i - 1]` appended to its original value if `l[a[i - 1] - 1]` is 1 for all `i` in the range from 0 to `n - 1`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations. If the value at index `a[i - 1] - 1` in `l` is 1 for all `i` in the range from 0 to `n - 1`, then `re` will be equal to `k` because `re` is incremented by 1 in each iteration when `l[a[i - 1] - 1]` is 1. Additionally, `res` will contain all values of `a[i - 1]` appended to its original value because `res` is appended with `a[i - 1]` in each iteration when `l[a[i - 1] - 1]` is 1. If `l[a[i - 1] - 1]` is not 1 for all `i` in the range from 0 to `n - 1`, then `re` will be less than `k` because `re` is only incremented when `l[a[i - 1] - 1]` is 1.
