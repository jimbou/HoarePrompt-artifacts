Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 1, `i` is `n + 1`, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of zeros except at index `a[i - 1] - 1` which is `n`, `r` is a list of zeros except at index `a[i] - 1` which is 2, `re` is 0, `k` is an integer**

The value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1. Since `r` is a list of zeros except at index `a[i] - 1` which is 1, the new value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2. The values of the other variables are not affected.
