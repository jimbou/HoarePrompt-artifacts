Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4, 1 <= k <= floor(n/2)). The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} (1 <= a_i <= n). Every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 * 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    l = [0] * n
    r = [0] * n
    re = ul = ur = 0
    res = []
    for i in range(n):
        l[a[i] - 1] += 1
    for i in range(n, 2 * n):
        r[a[i] - 1] += 1
    for i in range(n):
        if l[a[i] - 1] == 2:
            print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
            l[a[i] - 1] = 0
            ul += 2
        if ul == k * 2:
            break
    k = 2 * k - ul
    if k:
        for i in range(n):
            if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
                print(a[i], end=' ')
                re += 1
                res.append(a[i])
            if re == k:
                break
    print()
    for i in res:
        print(i, end=' ')
    if ul != ur:
        for i in range(n, 2 * n):
            if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
                print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
                r[a[i] - 1] = 0
                ur += 2
            if ul == ur:
                break
    print()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is 0 if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` was 2, otherwise it remains unchanged, `r` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is either 0 if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` was 2 or remains unchanged if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` was not 2, `re` is equal to `k` if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` is 1, `ul` is equal to `ur`, `ur` is either 0 if `r[a[i] - 1]` is not equal to 2 or 2 if `r[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 2, `res` is a list containing all values of `a[i]` appended to its original value, and `i` is equal to `2 * n`. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, then if `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0, `ur` is 2, and `res` is a list containing all values of `a[i]` appended to its original value, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, then `ul` is equal to `ur` and `ur` is either 0 if `r[a[i] - 1]` is not equal to 2 or 2 if `r[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 2, and nothing is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The loop has finished executing, and all elements in the list `res` have been printed. The value of `i` is the last element in the list `res`. The current values of `ul` and `ur` are equal, and a new line is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is a positive integer and at least 1, `i` is `2 * n`, `ul` equals `ur`, `res` is a list of integers that must have at least as many elements as the length of `res`, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of zeros except at index `a[i - 1] - 1` which is `n`, `r` is a list of zeros except at index `a[i] - 1` which is either 0 or 2, `re` is 0, `k` is `2 * k`. The last element of the list `res` which is `i` is being printed. If `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, then the value of `a[i]` is printed twice separated by a space, and `ur` is increased by 2. If `ul` equals `ur` initially, then no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
