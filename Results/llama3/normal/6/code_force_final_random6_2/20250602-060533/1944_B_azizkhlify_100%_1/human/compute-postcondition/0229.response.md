The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `2 * n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`, `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is `n + 1` and for the loop to execute again `n` must be at least 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 1, `i` is `n + 1`, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of zeros except at index `a[i - 1] - 1` which is `n`, `r` is a list of zeros except at index `a[i] - 1` which is 1, `re` is 0, `k` is an integer**
