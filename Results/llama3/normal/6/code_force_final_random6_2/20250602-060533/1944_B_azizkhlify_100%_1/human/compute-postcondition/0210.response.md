Output State: **i is 2 * n, n is greater than 0, r[a[2*n] - 1] is 0, ur is increased by 2, a[2*n] is printed twice**

The code snippet modifies the value of `r[a[2*n] - 1]` to 0 and increments `ur` by 2. The value of `i` remains unchanged as 2 * n, and `n` is still greater than 0. The print statement before the code snippet is not affected by the code and remains the same, printing `a[2*n]` twice.
