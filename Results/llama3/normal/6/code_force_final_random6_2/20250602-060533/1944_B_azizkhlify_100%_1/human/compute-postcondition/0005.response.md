Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index `a[0] - 1` is 2 and the value at index `a[1] - 1` is 1 and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of n zeros, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of n integers, `i` is 2**

In this output state, the value at index `a[0] - 1` in list `l` has been incremented by 1, and the value at index `a[1] - 1` in list `l` is now 1. The rest of the values in list `l` remain 0. The value of `i` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
