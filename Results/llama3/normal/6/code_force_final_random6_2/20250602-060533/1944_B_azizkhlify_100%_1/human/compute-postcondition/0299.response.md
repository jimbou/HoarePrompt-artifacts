Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `i` is `n`, `ul` and `ur` are not equal, `res` is a list of integers that must have at least as many elements as the length of `res`, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of zeros except at index `a[i - 1] - 1` which is `n`, `r` is a list of zeros except at index `a[i] - 1` which is `n`, `re` is 0, `k` is `2 * k`, and the last element of the list `res` which is `i` is being printed. The current value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2.***
