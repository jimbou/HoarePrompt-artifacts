Reasoning:

The problem requires finding a string s such that all possible strings of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of s. The program provided attempts to solve this problem.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program reads the number of test cases t and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads two integers n and k, where n is the length of the strings and k is the number of lowercase English alphabets to use.
3. The program then prints a string that is the first k lowercase English alphabets repeated n times.

The key insight here is that by repeating the first k lowercase English alphabets n times, the program ensures that every possible string of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets is a subsequence of the printed string.

For example, if n = 2 and k = 2, the program prints "abab". This string contains all possible strings of length 2 that can be formed using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets: "aa", "ab", "ba", and "bb".

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
