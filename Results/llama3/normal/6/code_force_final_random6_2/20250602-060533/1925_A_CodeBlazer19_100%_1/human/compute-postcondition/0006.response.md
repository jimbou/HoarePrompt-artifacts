Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 676, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, stdin contains `t-3` lines, each containing two integers `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26) and `k` (1 ≤ `k` ≤ 26), and the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' sliced up to the kth character repeated n times is being printed.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the new values read from the input, which are integers between 1 and 26. The stdin now contains `t-3` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, since one line has been read and processed. The string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' sliced up to the kth character repeated n times is still being printed.
