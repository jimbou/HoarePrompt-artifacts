To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is already an integer between 1 and 676, we can conclude that `t` is at least 1.

Before the loop starts, `i` is not defined, so we need to adjust its state to be 0, which is the starting value of the range.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 676, `i` is 0, stdin contains `t` lines, each containing two integers `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26) and `k` (1 ≤ `k` ≤ 26)**
