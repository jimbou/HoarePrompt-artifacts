Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 676, `i` is `t-1`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, stdin contains `t-t` lines, each containing two integers `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26) and `k` (1 ≤ `k` ≤ 26), and the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' sliced up to the kth character repeated n times is being printed, and this is printed: 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' sliced up to the kth character repeated n times, where n is an integer between 1 and 26, and k is an integer between 1 and 26, and 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' sliced up to the kth character repeated n times is being printed, and this is printed: 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' sliced up to the kth character repeated n times, where n is an integer between 1 and 26, and k is an integer between 1 and 26, and ... (t times)**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop variable `i` has reached `t-1`, indicating that the loop has executed `t` times. The input state remains unchanged, with `t` lines in stdin, each containing two integers `n` and `k`. The output is a repetition of the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' sliced up to the kth character repeated n times, where n and k are integers between 1 and 26, and this is printed `t` times.
