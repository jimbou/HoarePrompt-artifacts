Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 676, stdin contains t lines, each containing two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 26) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ 26)**

In this output state, the value of `t` is assigned the integer input from stdin, which is between 1 and 676. The stdin now contains t lines, each containing two integers n and k, where n is between 1 and 26, and k is between 1 and 26.
