The code prints a string that is a repetition of the first `k` characters of the alphabet, repeated `n` times. Here, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26, and `k` is an integer between 1 and 26.
Output: **'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' sliced up to the kth character repeated n times (where n is an integer between 1 and 26, and k is an integer between 1 and 26)**
