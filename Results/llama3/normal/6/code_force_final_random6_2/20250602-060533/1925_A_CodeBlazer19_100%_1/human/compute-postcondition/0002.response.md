Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 676, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26) and `k` (1 ≤ `k` ≤ 26)**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The variables `n` and `k` are assigned the values of the first two integers from the input, which are between 1 and 26. The stdin now contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, since one line has been read and processed.
