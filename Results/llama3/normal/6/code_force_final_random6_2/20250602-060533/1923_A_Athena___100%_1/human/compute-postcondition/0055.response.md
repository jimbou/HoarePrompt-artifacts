Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with all trailing zeros removed that is not empty and has at least `i+1` elements, `i` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is 0, `res` is increased by 2 and `stdin` contains t-5 test cases. If `a[i]` is not 0, `res` remains increased by 1 and `stdin` contains t-4 test cases.***
