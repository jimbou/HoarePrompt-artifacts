Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers and starts with a[1], `res` is 0, `i` is undefined, stdin contains t-6-len(a)+1 test cases**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated by removing the first element (which was 0) from the list. The other variables remain unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin has increased by 1 because the first element of `a` has been removed.
