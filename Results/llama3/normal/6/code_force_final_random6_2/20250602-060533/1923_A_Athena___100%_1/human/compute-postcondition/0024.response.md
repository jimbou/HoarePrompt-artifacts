According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than the length of `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `a` has at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `a` must have at least 3 elements.
State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is not empty and has at least 3 elements, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `i` is 2. If the current value of `a[i]` is 0, then `res` is 2. Otherwise, `res` is 1.**
