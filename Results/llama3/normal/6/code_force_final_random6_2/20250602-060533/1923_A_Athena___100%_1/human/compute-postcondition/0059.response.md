The only variable in the loop head is variable  t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is at least 0. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be decreased by 1. So `t` is at least 1.
State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with all trailing zeros removed, `res` is the number of zeros in `a`, `i` is the last index of `a`, `stdin` contains `t-5-len(a)` test cases if `a` contains at least one zero, otherwise `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, and the number of zeros in the list `a` which is `res` is being printed**
