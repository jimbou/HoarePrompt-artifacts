Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with all trailing zeros removed that is not empty and has at least `i+1` elements, `i` is increased by 1, `res` is increased by 2 if `a[i]` is 0, otherwise it remains increased by 1, `stdin` contains t-5 test cases if `a[i]` is 0, otherwise it contains t-4 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `res` is increased by 1, regardless of whether `a[i]` is 0 or not. The other variables remain unchanged. The number of test cases in `stdin` remains the same, depending on whether `a[i]` is 0 or not.
