Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is not empty and its first element has been removed, `res` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains the same, `n` is still an integer, and `res` is still 0. The list `a` has been modified by removing its first element, which was 0. The stdin still contains `t-2` test cases.
