Postcondition: ***t is at least 0, n is an integer, a is a list of integers with all trailing zeros removed that is not empty, stdin contains t-4 test cases. If the current value of a[i] is 0, then res is 1, otherwise, the value of res remains unchanged. The value of i remains unchanged in both cases.***
