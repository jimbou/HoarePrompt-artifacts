Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with no leading zeros and no trailing zeros that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-6-len(a)` test cases. If the current value of `a[i]` is 0, then `res` is either 3 or the previous value of `res` plus 1. Otherwise, `res` is the previous value of `res` plus 1.***
