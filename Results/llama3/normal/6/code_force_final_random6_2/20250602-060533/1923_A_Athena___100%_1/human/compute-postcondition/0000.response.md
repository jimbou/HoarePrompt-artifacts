The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of `int(input())` to `t`, where `input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1). In each test case, at least one cell contains a chip (a_i = 1). So stdin now contains t-1 test cases. The value of `t` is the first test case which is an integer. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1). In each test case, at least one cell contains a chip (a_i = 1).**
