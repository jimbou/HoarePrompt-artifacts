Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it removes leading and trailing zeros from the list of binary digits. This is correct because the problem statement allows us to move chips to the closest free cell to the left, so leading and trailing zeros do not affect the minimum number of operations required.
3. After removing leading and trailing zeros, the program counts the number of zeros remaining in the list. This is correct because each zero in the list represents a free cell that needs to be filled by moving a chip to its left. The minimum number of operations required is equal to the number of zeros in the list.
4. The program prints the count of zeros for each test case, which is the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them.

Therefore, the program correctly solves the problem and produces the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
