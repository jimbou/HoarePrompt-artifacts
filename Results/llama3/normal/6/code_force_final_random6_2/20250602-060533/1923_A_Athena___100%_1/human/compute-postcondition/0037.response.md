The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `a`. Since the first element of `a` is 0, this element is removed. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains `t-4` test cases.

Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is an integer, `a` has at least zero elements, `res` is 0, `i` is not defined, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases**
