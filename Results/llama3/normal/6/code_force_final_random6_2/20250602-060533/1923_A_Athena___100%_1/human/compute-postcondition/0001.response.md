The only variable in the loop head is variable `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer and stdin contains `t-1` test cases, so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is at least 1.
State: **`t` is at least 1, stdin contains `t-1` test cases**
