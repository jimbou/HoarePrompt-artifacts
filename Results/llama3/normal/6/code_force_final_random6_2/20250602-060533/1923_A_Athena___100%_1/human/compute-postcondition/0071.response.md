The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Since the last element of `a` is 0, it is removed. The length of `a` is reduced by 1.

The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with no leading zeros and its last element is not 0, `res` is 0, `i` is undefined, `stdin` contains `t-6-len(a)` test cases, the length of `a` is reduced by 1.**
