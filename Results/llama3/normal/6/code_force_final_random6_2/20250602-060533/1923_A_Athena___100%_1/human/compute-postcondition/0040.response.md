The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Since the last element of `a` is 0, this element is removed. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with its last element removed, `res` is 0, `i` is not defined, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases**
