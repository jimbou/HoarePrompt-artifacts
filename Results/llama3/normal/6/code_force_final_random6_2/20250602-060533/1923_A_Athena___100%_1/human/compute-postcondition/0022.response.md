Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is not empty and has at least 2 elements, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `i` is 1. If the current value of `a[i]` is 0, then `res` is 2. Otherwise, `res` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been incremented by 1. If the current value of `a[i]` is 0, then `res` is now 2. Otherwise, `res` remains 1. The values of the other variables, such as `t`, `n`, `a`, `stdin`, and `i`, remain unchanged.
