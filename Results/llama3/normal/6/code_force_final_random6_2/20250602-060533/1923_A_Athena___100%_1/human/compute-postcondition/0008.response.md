The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element of the list `a`. Since the first element of `a` is 0, it is removed from the list. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains `t-2` test cases.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is not empty, its first element is removed, `res` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases**
