The code `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. Initially, `res` is 0, so after the increment, `res` becomes 1.

The values of the other variables are not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is not empty and has at least 1 element, `res` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `i` is 0, and the current value of `a[i]` is 0.**
