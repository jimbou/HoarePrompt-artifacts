Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the list of binary digits `a`.
3.  It removes leading and trailing zeros from the list `a` using the `pop(0)` and `pop()` methods. This is correct because the problem statement allows moving chips to the closest free cell to the left, effectively ignoring leading and trailing zeros.
4.  It then counts the number of zeros remaining in the list `a` using a simple loop. This is correct because the problem statement defines the minimum number of operations as the number of free cells between chips.
5.  Finally, it prints the count of zeros for each test case, which represents the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them.

The execution summary accurately describes the program's behavior, and the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
