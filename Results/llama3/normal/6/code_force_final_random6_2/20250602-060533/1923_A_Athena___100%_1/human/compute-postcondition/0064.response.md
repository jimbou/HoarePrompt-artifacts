The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `a`. Since `a` starts with 0, the first element is 0 and it is removed from the list. The length of `a` is reduced by 1.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with length reduced by 1, `res` is 0, `i` is undefined, stdin contains t-6-len(a)+1 test cases**
