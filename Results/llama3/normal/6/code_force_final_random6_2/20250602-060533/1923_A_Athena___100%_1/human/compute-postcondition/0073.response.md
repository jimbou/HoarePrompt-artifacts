Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with no leading zeros and its last element is not 0 and its length is at least 0, `res` is 0, `i` is undefined, `stdin` contains `t-6-len(a)` test cases**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated as the last element of `a` has been removed by `a.pop()`. The length of `a` has also been decreased by 1. The values of the other variables are not affected.
