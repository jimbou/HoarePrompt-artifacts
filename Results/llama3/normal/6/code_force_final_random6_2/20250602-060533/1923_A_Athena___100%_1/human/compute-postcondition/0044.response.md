Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with at least one element and the last element of `a` is not 0, `res` is 0, `i` is not defined, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases**

The last element of list `a` is removed by the `pop()` function. The last element was 0, so now the last element of `a` is not 0. The values of the other variables are not affected.
