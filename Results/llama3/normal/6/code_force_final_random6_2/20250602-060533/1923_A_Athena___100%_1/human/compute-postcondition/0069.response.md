Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with no leading zeros and its last element is not 0, `res` is 0, `i` is undefined, `stdin` contains `t-6-len(a)` test cases**

The value of `a` has been changed by the code, as the last element of `a` has been removed using `a.pop()`. The last element of `a` was 0, so now the last element of `a` is not 0. The values of the other variables are not affected.
