Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with no leading zeros and no trailing zeros, `res` is the number of zeros in `a`, `i` is `len(a)`, `stdin` contains `t-6-len(a)` test cases.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `res` will be equal to the number of zeros in the list `a`. The variable `i` will be equal to the length of the list `a`. The other variables `t`, `n`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
