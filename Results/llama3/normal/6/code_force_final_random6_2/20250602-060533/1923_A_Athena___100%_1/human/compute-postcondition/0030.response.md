To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which in this case is only the variable `t`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be decremented by 1.

State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is not empty, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `res` is equal to the number of zeros in `a`**
