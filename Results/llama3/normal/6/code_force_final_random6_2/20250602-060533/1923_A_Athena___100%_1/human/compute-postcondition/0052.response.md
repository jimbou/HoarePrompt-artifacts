Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with all trailing zeros removed that is not empty, `i` is one more than its previous value, `res` is increased by 1 if `a[i]` is 0, otherwise it remains unchanged, `stdin` contains t-5 test cases if `a[i]` is 0, otherwise it contains t-4 test cases.***
