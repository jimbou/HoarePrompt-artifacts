Output State: **t is at least 0, n is an integer, a is a list of integers with all trailing zeros removed, res is the number of zeros in a, i is the last index of a, stdin contains t-4-len(a) test cases if a contains at least one zero, otherwise stdin contains t-4 test cases.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will be as follows:

*   The value of `t` remains unchanged, still being at least 0.
*   The value of `n` remains unchanged, still being an integer.
*   The list `a` remains unchanged, still containing integers with all trailing zeros removed.
*   The value of `res` will be the total number of zeros in the list `a`.
*   The value of `i` will be the last index of the list `a`.
*   The number of test cases in `stdin` will be decreased by the length of `a` if `a` contains at least one zero, otherwise it will remain unchanged.
