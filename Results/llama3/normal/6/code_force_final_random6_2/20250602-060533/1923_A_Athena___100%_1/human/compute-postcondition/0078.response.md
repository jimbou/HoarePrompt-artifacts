Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with no leading zeros and no trailing zeros that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-6-len(a)` test cases. If the current value of `a[i]` is 0, then `res` is 1. Otherwise, the state of `res` is not specified.***
