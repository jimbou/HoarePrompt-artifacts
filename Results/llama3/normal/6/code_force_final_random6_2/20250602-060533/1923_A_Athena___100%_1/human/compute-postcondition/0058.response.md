Output: **t is at least 0, n is an integer, a is a list of integers with all trailing zeros removed, res is the number of zeros in a, i is the last index of a, stdin contains t-4-len(a) test cases if a contains at least one zero, otherwise stdin contains t-4 test cases, and the number of zeros in the list a which is res is being printed**
