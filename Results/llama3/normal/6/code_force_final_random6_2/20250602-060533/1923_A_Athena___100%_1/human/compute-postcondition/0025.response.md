Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is not empty and has at least 3 elements, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `i` is 2. If the current value of `a[i]` is 0, then `res` is 3. Otherwise, `res` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been incremented by 1. If the current value of `a[i]` is 0, then `res` is now 3. Otherwise, `res` is now 2. The values of the other variables remain the same.
