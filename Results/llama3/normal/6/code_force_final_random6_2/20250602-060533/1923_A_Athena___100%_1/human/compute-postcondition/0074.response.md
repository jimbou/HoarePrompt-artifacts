Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with no leading zeros and no trailing zeros, `res` is 0, `i` is undefined, `stdin` contains `t-6-len(a)` test cases.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `a` will have all trailing zeros removed, while the other variables remain unchanged.
