Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with no leading zeros and no trailing zeros that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `res` is either 3 or the previous value of `res` plus 1 if `a[i]` is 0, otherwise `res` is the previous value of `res` plus 1, `stdin` contains `t-6-len(a)` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `res` is incremented by 1. If the current value of `a[i]` is 0, then `res` is either 3 or the previous value of `res` plus 1. Otherwise, the state of `res` is not specified, but it is still the previous value of `res` plus 1. The values of the other variables are not affected.
