The code snippet provided consists of three lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. The second line assigns a list of integers from the input to `a`. The third line resets the value of `res` to 0.

Output State: **t is at least 1, n is an integer, a is a list of integers, res is 0, i is undefined, stdin contains t-6-len(a) test cases if a contains at least one zero, otherwise stdin contains t-6 test cases.**
