Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The program first removes any leading or trailing zeros from the input list `a`. This is because these zeros do not affect the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block.

2. The program then iterates over the remaining elements in the list `a`. For each zero encountered, it increments the result `res` by 1. This is because each zero represents a free cell that needs to be filled by moving a chip from the right.

3. The program finally prints the result `res`, which represents the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* Cases where there are no free cells between the chips (in which case the result is 0).
* Cases where there are free cells between the chips (in which case the result is the number of free cells).
* Cases where the input list `a` contains only zeros (in which case the result is 0).
* Cases where the input list `a` contains only ones (in which case the result is 0).

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them, and it handles all possible cases correctly.
