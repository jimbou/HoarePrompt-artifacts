Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is not empty and its last element is unknown, `res` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases**

In this output state, the value of `a`'s last element is unknown because the `pop()` function removes the last element from the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
