Output State: **t is at least 1, n is an integer, a is a list of integers, res is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases**

The code snippet reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`, then reads a list of integers from stdin and assigns it to `a`. The variable `res` is initialized to 0. The value of `t` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The number of test cases in stdin decreases by 2, as two inputs are read from stdin.
