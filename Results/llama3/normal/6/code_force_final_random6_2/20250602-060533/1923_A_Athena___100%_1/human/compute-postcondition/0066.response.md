Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with length reduced by 2 and is not empty, `res` is 0, `i` is undefined, stdin contains t-6-len(a)+1 test cases**

In this output state, the list `a` has been modified by removing its first element, which was 0. The length of `a` has been reduced by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin remains the same, as the code does not affect the input.
