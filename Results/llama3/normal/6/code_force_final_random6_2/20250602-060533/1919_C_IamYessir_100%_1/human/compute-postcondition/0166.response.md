Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1. `a` is either empty or not empty. If `a` is empty, then `x` is positive infinity, `b` is a list with at least one element, and `y` is positive infinity. If `a` is not empty, then `x` is the last element of `a`. If the length of `b` is 0, then `y` is positive infinity. Otherwise, `b` is a list with at least one element and `y` is positive infinity. If `x` is greater than `y`, then if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, `b` has at least two elements and `y` is positive infinity. If `y` is less than `lit[i]`, then `y` is positive infinity. If `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `y` is positive infinity. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x`, then `a` has at least two elements and `x` is equal to `lit[i]`. If `x` is less than or equal to `y`, then if `x` equals `y`, `a` has at least two elements and `x` is the i-th element of `lit`. If `x` is less than `y`, then if `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, `a` has at least two elements and `x` is the last element of `a` which is `lit[i]`. If `x` is strictly less than `lit[i]`, then `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y`, and if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `b` is a list with at least two elements, the last element of `b` is `lit[i]`, and `y` is positive infinity.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `y` is set to positive infinity. The values of other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The conditions related to `x` and `y` are updated accordingly, considering the new value of `y`.
