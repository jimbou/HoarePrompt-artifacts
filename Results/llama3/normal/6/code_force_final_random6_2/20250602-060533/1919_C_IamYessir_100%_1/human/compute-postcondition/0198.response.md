The code `a.append(lit[i])` adds the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the end of the list `a`. Since `i` is 2, the element added to `a` is the third element of `lit` (since indexing starts at 0).

The values of the other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `y` is positive infinity if `b` is an empty list, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`, `x` is positive infinity if `lit` is an empty list, otherwise `x` is the last element of `lit`, and `a` is a list with an additional element, which is the third element of `lit`.**
