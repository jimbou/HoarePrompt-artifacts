Output State: **The values of `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `i`, `s`, `a`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. `b` is a list of integers that is not empty and contains `lit[i]` as its last element. If `x` is greater than `y`, then if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, `y` is the last element of `b` which is equal to `lit[i]`. If `y` is less than `lit[i]`, then if `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, `y` is the last element of `b`. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x`, then if `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, then `y` is the last element of `b` which is equal to `lit[i]`. If `x` is less than `lit[i]` or `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y`, then `y` is the last element of `b`. If `x` is not greater than `y`, then if `x` is equal to `y`, `y` is either positive infinity or the last element of `b`. If `x` is not equal to `y`, then if `x` is less than `y`, `y` is the last element of `b`. If `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, then `y` is the last element of `b`, except that if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `y` is the last element of `b` which is equal to `lit[i]`.**
