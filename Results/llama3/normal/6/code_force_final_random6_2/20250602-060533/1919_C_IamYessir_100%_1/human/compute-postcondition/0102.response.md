Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `x` is the last element of `a`, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is infinity. If the current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is 3. Otherwise, `s` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been incremented by 1. If the current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is now 3, otherwise it is 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
