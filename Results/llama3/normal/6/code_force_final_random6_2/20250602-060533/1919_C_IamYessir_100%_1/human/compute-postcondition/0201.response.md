Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `b` is a list that contains the third element of `lit`, `y` is the third element of `lit`. If `lit` is an empty list, then `x` is positive infinity. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `lit`.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to include the third element of `lit`, and the value of `y` has been updated to be the third element of `lit`. The values of the other variables remain the same.
