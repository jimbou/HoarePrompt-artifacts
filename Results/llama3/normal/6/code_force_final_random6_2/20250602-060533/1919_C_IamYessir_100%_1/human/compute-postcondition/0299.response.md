Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `s` is undefined. If `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, then `a` contains `lit[i]`, `b` is a list of integers that is not empty, `y` is the last element of `b` which is equal to `lit[i]`, and `x` is either less than or equal to `y` or greater than `y` and less than or equal to `lit[i]`. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y`, then the values of `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `i`, `s`, `b`, `a`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged, except that if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `b` is a list of integers that is not empty, `y` is the last element of `b` which is equal to `lit[i]`, `a` is either an empty list or a list of integers that is not empty and has one more element which is the first element of `lit`.**
