This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It then processes these integers, splitting them into two lists a and b based on certain conditions. The function counts the number of pairs of adjacent elements in both lists where the second element is greater than the first and prints this count. The function repeats this process for all test cases in the input.
