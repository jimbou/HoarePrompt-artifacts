Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `x` is positive infinity, `y` is positive infinity, `s` is undefined.**

The code `x = float('inf')` assigns the value of positive infinity to `x`. However, `x` is already positive infinity in the initial state, so this assignment does not change its value. The values of the other variables remain the same.
