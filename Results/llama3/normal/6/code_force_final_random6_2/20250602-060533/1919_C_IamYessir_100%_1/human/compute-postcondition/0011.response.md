Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `b` is a non-empty list, `cp` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 0, `y` is the last element of `b`. If `a` is an empty list, then `x` is positive infinity. Otherwise, `a` is a list of integers and is not empty, and `x` is the last element of `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been updated to be the last element of the non-empty list `b`. The other variables remain unchanged, and their properties are still valid. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and the values of `n`, `lit`, `cp`, and `i` are unchanged. The relationship between `a` and `x` also remains the same.
