To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the given state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for i in range(0, n):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
- `n` is an integer greater than 1
- `lit` is a list of integers
- `cp` is 0
- `i` is 1

To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to increment `i` by 1, since the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
- `n` is an integer greater than 2 (since `i` is now 2)
- `lit` is a list of integers (no change)
- `cp` is 0 (no change)
- `i` is 2

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2**
