Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `b` is a list of integers, `x` is the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is positive infinity, `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is positive infinity, `s` is 0. The current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `a[i - 1]`.***
