Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is either positive infinity or the last element of `a`, `y` is either positive infinity or the last element of `b`, `i` is 1, `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus 1. The current value of `b[i]` is greater than the current value of `b[i - 1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been incremented by 1, indicating that there is one more occurrence where an element in `a` is greater than its previous element. All other variables remain unchanged.
