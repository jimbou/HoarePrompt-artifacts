Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least two elements and `x` is the i-th element of `lit`, `b` is a list with at least one element and `y` is the last element of `b`. Additionally, `x` is less than or equal to `y`. The current value of `x` equals the current value of `y`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n`, `cp`, `i` and `lit` remains the same. The list `a` now has at least two elements and its last element is the i-th element of `lit`. The value of `x` is updated to the i-th element of `lit`. The list `b` and the value of `y` remains the same. The condition that `x` is less than or equal to `y` still holds, and the current value of `x` equals the current value of `y`.
