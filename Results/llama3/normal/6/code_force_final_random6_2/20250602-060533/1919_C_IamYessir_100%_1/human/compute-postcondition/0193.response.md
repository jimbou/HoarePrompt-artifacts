Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `b` is a list of integers with the last element of `lit` appended to it, `y` is the last element of `lit` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is positive infinity, `x` is positive infinity if `lit` is empty, otherwise `x` is the last element of `lit`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains an integer greater than 2, the list `lit` remains unchanged, the value of `cp` remains 0, and the value of `i` remains 2. The list `b` now has the last element of `lit` appended to it. The value of `y` is now the last element of `lit` if `b` is not empty, otherwise it remains positive infinity. The value of `x` remains positive infinity if `lit` is empty, otherwise it remains the last element of `lit`.
