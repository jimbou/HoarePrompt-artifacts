Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `b` is a list of integers, `x` is either positive infinity or the last element of `a`, `y` is either positive infinity or the last element of `b`, `i` is 3, if `a[i]` is larger than `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is 3. Otherwise, `s` remains 2.***
