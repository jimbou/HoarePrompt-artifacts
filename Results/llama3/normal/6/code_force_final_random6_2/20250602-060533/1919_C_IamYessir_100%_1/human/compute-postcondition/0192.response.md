The code `b.append(lit[i])` adds the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the end of the list `b`. Since `i` is 2, the element at index 2 of `lit` is added to `b`.

The value of `y` is updated because it is defined as the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty. Since `b` is not empty after the append operation, `y` is now the last element of `b`, which is the element at index 2 of `lit`.

The values of the other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `b` is a list with one more element than before, `y` is the element at index 2 of `lit`, and if `lit` is an empty list, then `x` is positive infinity. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `lit`.**
