Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, lit is a list of integers, cp is 0, i is n-1, a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers, x is the last element of a if a is not empty, otherwise x is positive infinity, y is the last element of b if b is not empty, otherwise y is positive infinity.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `n` remains unchanged, `lit` is still a list of integers, `cp` is still 0, and `i` has reached the last index of the list `lit`. The lists `a` and `b` have been updated according to the conditions in the loop body, and `x` and `y` are the last elements of `a` and `b` respectively, or positive infinity if the lists are empty.
