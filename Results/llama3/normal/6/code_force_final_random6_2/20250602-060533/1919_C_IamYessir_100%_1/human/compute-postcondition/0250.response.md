Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `s` is undefined, `b` is a list of integers that is not empty, `a` is either an empty list or a list of integers that is not empty, `x` is either positive infinity or the last element of `a`, and `y` is the last element of `b` which is equal to `lit[i]`. The current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `y`.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to include the current element of `lit` at index `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `x` and `y` is still maintained, with `x` being greater than `y`. The value of `y` is now equal to the last element of `b`, which is `lit[i]`.
