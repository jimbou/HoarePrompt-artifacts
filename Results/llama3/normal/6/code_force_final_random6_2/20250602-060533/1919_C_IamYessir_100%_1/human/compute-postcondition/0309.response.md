Output State: **`n`, `lit`, `cp`, `i`, `s`, `b`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged. `y` is positive infinity. If the length of `a` is 0, then `x` is positive infinity. If `x` is greater than `y`, then `x` is greater than positive infinity, which is not possible, so this condition is not met. If `x` is not greater than `y`, then if `x` is equal to `y`, `a` is either an empty list or a list of integers that is not empty and contains `lit[i]` as its last element, `b` is a list of integers that is not empty, `y` is positive infinity, and `x` is either undefined or the last element of `a` which is less than `y` if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`. If `x` is not equal to `y`, then if `x` is less than `y`, `a` contains `lit[i]`, `b` is a list of integers that is not empty, `y` is positive infinity, and `x` is either less than `y` or greater than `y`. If `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, then the values of `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `i`, `s`, `b`, `a`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged, except that if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `b` is a list of integers that is not empty, `y` is positive infinity which is equal to `lit[i]`, `a` is either an empty list or a list of integers that is not empty and has one more element which is the first element of `lit`.**

In natural language, the output state is that `y` is set to positive infinity, and the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to `x` and `y` are updated based on the new value of `y`.
