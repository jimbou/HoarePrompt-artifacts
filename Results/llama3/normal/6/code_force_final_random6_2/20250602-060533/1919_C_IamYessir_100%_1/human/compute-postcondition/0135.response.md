Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and `x` is the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is positive infinity. `b` is a list with at least one element and `y` is the last element of `b`. The current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `y`. `y` is less than `lit[i]`. Additionally, the current value of `lit[i]` is greater than the current value of `x`.**
