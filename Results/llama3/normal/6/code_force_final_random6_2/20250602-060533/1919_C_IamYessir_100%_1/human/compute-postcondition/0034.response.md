Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers and is not empty, `x` is the last element of `a` which is `lit[i]`, `b` is a non-empty list, `y` is the last element of `b`, `x` is less than `y` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains a positive integer, `lit` is still a list of integers, `cp` is still 0, `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and `i` is still 0. The list `a` is no longer empty and now contains the element `lit[i]`, which is also the new value of `x`. The list `b` and its last element `y` remain unchanged. The relationship between `x`, `y`, and `lit[i]` is updated: `x` is now equal to `lit[i]`, which is still greater than `y`.
