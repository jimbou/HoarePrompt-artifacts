Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `s` is undefined. `b` is either an empty list or a list of integers that is not empty. If `b` is an empty list, then `a` is either an empty list or a list of integers that is not empty, and the current value of `x` is either positive infinity or the last element of `a`, and the current value of `y` is positive infinity. If `b` is not an empty list, then the current value of `y` is the last element of `b`, and `a` is either an empty list or a list of integers that is not empty, and the current value of `x` is either positive infinity or the last element of `a`. The current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `y`. Additionally, the current value of `y` is less than `lit[i]`. `lit[i]` is less than or equal to the current value of `x`. The current value of `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, and `lit[i]` is greater than the current value of `y`.***
