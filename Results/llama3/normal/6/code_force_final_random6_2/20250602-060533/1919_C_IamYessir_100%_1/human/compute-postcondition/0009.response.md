Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 0, `y` is positive infinity, If `a` is an empty list, then `x` is positive infinity. Otherwise, `a` is a list of integers and is not empty, and `x` is the last element of `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been assigned to positive infinity. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. The value of `x` is still dependent on the state of list `a`.
