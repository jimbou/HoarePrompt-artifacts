Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and `x` is the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is positive infinity. `b` is a list with at least two elements and `y` is the element at index `i` in the list `lit`. The current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `y`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n`, `cp`, `i`, `a`, and `x` remains the same. The list `b` now has at least two elements, and its last element `y` is the element at index `i` in the list `lit`. The relationship between `x` and `y` remains the same, with `x` being greater than `y`.
