Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `s` is undefined. If `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, then `a` is either an empty list or a list of integers that is not empty and contains `lit[i]` as its last element, `x` is either positive infinity or `lit[i]`, and `y` is either positive infinity or the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty. Otherwise, if `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, then `a` is either an empty list or a list of integers that is not empty and contains `lit[i]`, `x` is either positive infinity or the last element of `a` which is `lit[i]`, `y` is either positive infinity or the last element of `b` and is greater than `lit[i]`. Otherwise, if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `b` is a list of integers that is not empty, the last element of `b` is `lit[i]`, `a` is either an empty list or a list of integers that is not empty, the current value of `x` is either positive infinity or the last element of `a`, the current value of `y` is `lit[i]`, the current value of `x` is less than the current value of `y`, the current value of `x` is less than `lit[i]`, the current value of `lit[i]` is less than or equal to the current value of `y`, and the current value of `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`. Otherwise, the values of `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `i`, `s`, `b`, `a`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.**
