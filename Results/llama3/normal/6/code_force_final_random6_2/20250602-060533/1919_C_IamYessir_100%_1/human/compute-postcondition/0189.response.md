Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `y` is positive infinity. If `lit` is an empty list, then `x` is positive infinity. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `lit`.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been updated to positive infinity, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `x` and `lit` also remains the same, depending on whether `lit` is empty or not.
