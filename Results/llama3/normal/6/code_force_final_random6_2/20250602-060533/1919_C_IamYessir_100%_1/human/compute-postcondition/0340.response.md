Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `x` is either positive infinity or the last element of `a`, `y` is either positive infinity or the last element of `b`, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is as follows:

*   The initial state variables `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `b`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
*   The variable `a` is a list of integers.
*   The variable `i` is equal to the length of `a`.
*   The variable `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element.
