Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 0. If `a` is an empty list, then `x` is positive infinity. Otherwise, `a` is a list of integers and is not empty, and `x` is the last element of `a`. If `b` is an empty list, then `y` is positive infinity. Otherwise, `b` is a non-empty list and `y` is the last element of `b`. Additionally, `x` is less than `y` and `x` is less than `lit[i]`. `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y`***
