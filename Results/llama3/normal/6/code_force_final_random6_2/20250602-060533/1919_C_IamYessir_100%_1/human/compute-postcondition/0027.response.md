Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 0, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `x` is the last element of `a` and is equal to `lit[i]`, `b` is a non-empty list of integers, `y` is the last element of `b` and is equal to `x`, `a` is a list of integers with one more element than before.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated by appending the `i-th` element of `lit` to it. As a result, `a` is no longer an empty list, and `x` is now equal to the last element of `a`, which is `lit[i]`. The value of `y` remains the same, as it is still equal to `x`. The other variables remain unchanged.
