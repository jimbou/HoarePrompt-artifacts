The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `s` is undefined. If `x` is greater than `y`, then if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, `b` is a list of integers that is not empty, `y` is the last element of `b` which is equal to `lit[i]`, and `a` is either an empty list or a list of integers that is not empty and has one more element which is the first element of `lit`. If `y` is less than `lit[i]`, then if `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, `b` is a list of integers that is not empty, `y` is the last element of `b`, and `a` is either an empty list or a list of integers that is not empty and has one more element which is the first element of `lit`. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x`, then if `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, then `a` contains `lit[i]`, `b` is a list of integers that is not empty, `y` is the last element of `b` which is equal to `lit[i]`, and `x` is either greater than `y` or less than or equal to `y`. If `x` is less than `lit[i]` or `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y`, then the values of `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `i`, `s`, `b`, `a`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. If `x` is not greater than `y`, then if `x` is equal to `y`, `a` is either an empty list or a list of integers that is not empty and contains `lit[i]` as its last element, `b` is a list of integers that is not empty, `y` is either positive infinity or the last element of `b`, and `x` is either undefined or the last element of `a` which is greater than `y` if `y` is less than `lit[i]`, or `x` is either undefined or the last element of `a` which is less than `y` if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`. If `x` is not equal to `y`, then if `x` is less than `y`, `a` contains `lit[i]`, `b` is a list of integers that is not empty, `y` is the last element of `b`, and `x` is either less than `y` or greater than `y`. If `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, then the values of `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `i`, `s`, `b`, `a`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged, except that if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `b` is a list of integers that is not empty, `y` is the last element of `b` which is equal to `lit[i]`, `a` is either an empty list or a list of integers that is not empty and has one more element which is the first element of `lit`.
