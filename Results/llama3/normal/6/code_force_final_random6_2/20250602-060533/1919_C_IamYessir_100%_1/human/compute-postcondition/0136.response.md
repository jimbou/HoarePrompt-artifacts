Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and `x` is the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is positive infinity. `b` is a list with at least one element and `y` is the last element of `b` which is equal to `lit[i]`. The current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `y`. `y` is less than `lit[i]`. Additionally, the current value of `lit[i]` is greater than the current value of `x`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `i`, `a`, and `x` remains the same as in the initial state. The list `b` now has an additional element which is the current value of `lit[i]`, and `y` is updated to be equal to this new last element of `b`. The relationship between `x` and `y` is still maintained, with `x` being greater than `y`, and `y` is still less than `lit[i]`. Also, `lit[i]` is still greater than `x`.
