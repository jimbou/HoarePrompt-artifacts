Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `b` is an empty list, `y` is positive infinity, `s` is undefined, stdin contains no input. If `a` is an empty list, then `a` remains empty and `x` remains positive infinity. Otherwise, `a` is a list of integers that is not empty, `x` is the last element of `a`***
