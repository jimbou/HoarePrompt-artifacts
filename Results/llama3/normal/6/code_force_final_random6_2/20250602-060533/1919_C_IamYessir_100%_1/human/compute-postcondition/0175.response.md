Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `a` has at least one element and the last element of `a` is `lit[i]`, if `a` is not empty, then `x` is the last element of `a` which is `lit[i]`, if `x` is greater than `y`, then if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, `b` has at least two elements and `y` is the element at index `i` in the list `lit`. If `y` is less than `lit[i]`, then `y` is less than `lit[i]`. If `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `y` is equal to `lit[i]`. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x`, then `a` has at least two elements and `x` is equal to `lit[i]`. If `x` is less than or equal to `y`, then if `x` equals `y`, `a` has at least two elements and `x` is the i-th element of `lit`. If `x` is less than `y`, then if `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, `a` has at least two elements and `x` is the last element of `a` which is `lit[i]`. If `x` is strictly less than `lit[i]`, then `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y`, and if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `b` is a list with at least two elements, the last element of `b` is `lit[i]`, and `y` is `lit[i]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `a` now has at least one element, and its last element is the `i-th` element of the list `lit`. The value of `x` is updated to be the last element of `a`, which is `lit[i]`. The relationships between `x`, `y`, `lit[i]`, `a`, and `b` are updated accordingly based on their relative values.
