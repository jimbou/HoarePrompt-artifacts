Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2. If `y` is greater than or equal to the element at index `i` in `lit`, then `b` is a list with one more element than before, `y` is the element at index 2 of `lit`. Otherwise, if the element at index `i` in `lit` is greater than `x`, then `b` is a list of integers with the last element of `lit` appended to it and `y` is the last element of `lit` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is positive infinity. If `x` is greater than or equal to the element at index `i` in `lit` and the element at index `i` in `lit` is greater than `y`, then `a` is a list with the last element of `lit` appended to it. If `lit` is an empty list, then `x` is positive infinity. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `lit`.***
