Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `s` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is `n`, `a` is a list of integers and is not empty, `x` is the last element of `a`, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is infinity. If `x` is greater than `y`, then `b` contains an additional element which is `lit[i]`. If `x` is less than or equal to `y`, then if `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, then `a` contains an additional element which is `lit[i]`. If `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, then `a` contains an additional element which is `lit[i]`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `b` contains an additional element which is `lit[i]`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `s` which is initialized to 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
