Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 1. `a` is a list of integers and is not empty, and the current value of `x` is either the last element of `a` or infinity. If `b` is empty, then `y` is infinity. Otherwise, `b` is a non-empty list and the current value of `y` is the last element of `b`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, then the last element of `b` is the element at index `i` in `lit` which is less than or equal to `x`, and `y` is the last element of `b` which is less than or equal to `x`. If `y` is less than `lit[i]`, then `y` is less than `lit[i]`. If `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `lit[i]` is greater than `x`. Otherwise, `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x`, and if `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, then `a` now contains an additional element which is `lit[i]`. If `x` is less than or equal to `y`, then if `x` is equal to `y`, then `a` is a list of integers with one more element than before. If `x` is less than `y`, then if `x` is greater than or equal to the `i-th` element of `lit`, `x` is equal to the `i-th` element of `lit`. If `x` is less than the `i-th` element of `lit`, then if the `i-th` element of `lit` is greater than `y`, `x` is equal to the `i-th` element of `lit`. If `y` is greater than or equal to the `i-th` element of `lit` and the `i-th` element of `lit` is greater than `x`, then `y` is equal to the `i-th` element of `lit`. Otherwise, `y` remains unchanged. The current value of `x` is either less than or equal to the current value of `y` or greater than `y`. The current value of the `i-th` element of `lit` is either less than or equal to `y`. `n` must be greater than 1. `a` now contains an additional element which is `lit[i]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `a` now contains an additional element which is the `i-th` element of `lit`. All other variables remain unchanged.
