Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `b` has at least two elements and its last element is `lit[i]`, `y` is `lit[i]`, `x` is either the last element of `a` or positive infinity, `a` is either an empty list or a list with at least two elements.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to include the element at index `i` from the list `lit`. The value of `y` has also been updated to be equal to `lit[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to the lists `a` and `b` and the variables `x` and `y` are still valid, but the specific values of `x` and the length of `a` are not changed by the code.
