To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer, which means it is already at least 1, so we don't need to adjust it. However, we need to set `i` to 0, which is the starting value of the range.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 0**
