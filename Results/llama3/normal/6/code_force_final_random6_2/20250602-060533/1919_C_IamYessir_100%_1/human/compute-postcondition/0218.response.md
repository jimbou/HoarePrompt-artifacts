Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `b` is a list of integers, `x` is the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is positive infinity, `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is positive infinity, `s` is either 1 or 2. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is 2. Otherwise, `s` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, then `s` was initially 1 and is now 2. Otherwise, `s` was initially 0 and is now 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
