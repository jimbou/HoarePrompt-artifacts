Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `s` is undefined. `x` is either positive infinity or the last element of `a`, and `y` is either positive infinity or the last element of `b`. Additionally, `x` is equal to `y`. If `b` is an empty list, then `a` is either an empty list or a list of integers that is not empty. If `b` is not an empty list, then `a` is either an empty list or a list of integers that is not empty.**
