Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is the last element of `a`, `b` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `y` is the last element of `b`, `s` is the number of times the value of `a[i]` is greater than the value of `a[i - 1]` for all `i` in the range from 1 to `len(a) - 1` plus 2 (if `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`) or remains the number of times the value of `a[i]` is greater than the value of `a[i - 1]` for all `i` in the range from 1 to `len(a) - 1` plus 1 (otherwise)**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `s` has been incremented by 1. This means that the number of times the value of `a[i]` is greater than the value of `a[i - 1]` for all `i` in the range from 1 to `len(a) - 1` has increased by 1, either by 1 or by 2 depending on whether `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`.
