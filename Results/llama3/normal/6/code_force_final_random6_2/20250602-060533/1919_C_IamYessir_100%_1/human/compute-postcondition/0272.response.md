Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `s` is undefined. `b` is a list of integers that is not empty, the last element of `b` is `lit[i]`, `a` is either an empty list or a list of integers that is not empty, the current value of `x` is either positive infinity or the last element of `a`, the current value of `y` is `lit[i]`, the current value of `x` is less than the current value of `y`, the current value of `x` is less than `lit[i]`, the current value of `lit[i]` is less than or equal to the current value of `y`, and the current value of `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to be a non-empty list of integers, with the last element being `lit[i]`. The values of `x` and `y` have also been updated, with `y` now being equal to `lit[i]`, and `x` being less than `y`. The other variables remain unchanged.
