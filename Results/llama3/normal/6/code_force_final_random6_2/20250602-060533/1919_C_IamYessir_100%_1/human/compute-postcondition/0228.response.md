To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `b`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than the length of `b`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `b` must have at least 3 elements. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. Since `b` must have at least 3 elements, it must have at least 4 elements for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `x` is the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is positive infinity, `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is positive infinity. If the current value of `b[i]` is greater than the current value of `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the second element is greater than the first plus 1 plus 1. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged.**
