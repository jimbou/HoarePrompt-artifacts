Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and `x` is the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is positive infinity. If the length of `b` is 0, then `y` is positive infinity. Otherwise, `b` is a list with at least one element and `y` is the last element of `b`. Additionally, `x` is less than or equal to `y` and `x` is not equal to `y`. If `x` is less than `y`, then if `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, then `a` has at least two elements and `x` is the last element of `a` which is `lit[i]`. If `x` is strictly less than `lit[i]`, then `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y`, and if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `b` is a list with at least two elements, the last element of `b` is `lit[i]`, and `y` is `lit[i]`.***
