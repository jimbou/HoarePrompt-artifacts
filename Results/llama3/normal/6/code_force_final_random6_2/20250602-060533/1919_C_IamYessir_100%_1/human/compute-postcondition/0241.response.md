Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers that is not empty, `b` is an empty list, `x` is the last element of `a`, `y` is positive infinity, `s` is undefined, stdin contains no input**

The code assigns the last element of list `a` to variable `x`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The last element of `a` is assigned to `x`, but the specific value of this element is unknown since the elements of `a` are not specified. Therefore, the output state is as described above.
