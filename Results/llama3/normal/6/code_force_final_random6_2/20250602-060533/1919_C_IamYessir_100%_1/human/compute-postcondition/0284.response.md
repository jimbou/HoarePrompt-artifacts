Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `s` is undefined, `b` is either an empty list or a list of integers that is not empty, `a` is either an empty list or a list of integers that is not empty, `x` is either positive infinity or the last element of `a`, and `y` is positive infinity.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been changed to positive infinity. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to `y` being greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, `y` being less than `lit[i]`, and the relationships between `x`, `y`, and `lit[i]` are no longer applicable since `y` is now positive infinity.
