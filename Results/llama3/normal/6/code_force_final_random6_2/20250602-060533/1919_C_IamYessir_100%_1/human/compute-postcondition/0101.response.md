The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `len(a)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `a` has at least 3 elements. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and `a` must have at least 4 elements.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `x` is the last element of `a`, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is infinity. If the current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is 2. Otherwise, `s` is 1.**
