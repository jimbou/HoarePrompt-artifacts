Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, lit is a list of integers, a is an empty list, b is an empty list, cp is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if len(a) == 0:
        x = float('inf')
    else:
        x = a[-1]
    if len(b) == 0:
        y = float('inf')
    else:
        y = b[-1]
    if x > y:
        if y >= lit[i]:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
    elif x == y:
        a.append(lit[i])
    elif x < y:
        if x >= lit[i]:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 0. `a` is a list of integers and is not empty, and the current value of `x` is the last element of `a`. `b` is a non-empty list and the current value of `y` is the last element of `b`. If `x` is greater than `y`, then `x` is greater than `y`, and if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, then the last element of `b` is the element at index `i` in `lit` which is less than or equal to `x`, and `y` is the last element of `b` which is less than or equal to `x`. If `y` is less than `lit[i]`, then `y` is less than `lit[i]`. If `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `lit[i]` is greater than `x`. Otherwise, `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x`, and if `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, then `a` now contains an additional element which is `lit[i]`. If `x` is less than or equal to `y`, then if `x` is equal to `y`, then `a` is a list of integers with one more element than before. If `x` is less than `y`, then if `x` is greater than or equal to the `i-th` element of `lit`, `x` is equal to the `i-th` element of `lit`. If `x` is less than the `i-th` element of `lit`, then if the `i-th` element of `lit` is greater than `y`, `x` is equal to the `i-th` element of `lit`. If `y` is greater than or equal to the `i-th` element of `lit` and the `i-th` element of `lit` is greater than `x`, then `y` is equal to the `i-th` element of `lit`. Otherwise, `y` remains unchanged. The current value of `x` is less than or equal to the current value of `y`. The current value of the `i-th` element of `lit` is either less than or equal to `y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is a positive integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 1. `a` is a list of integers and is not empty, and the current value of `x` is either the last element of `a` or infinity. If `b` is empty, then `y` is infinity. Otherwise, `b` is a non-empty list and the current value of `y` is the last element of `b`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, then the last element of `b` is the element at index `i` in `lit` which is less than or equal to `x`, and `y` is the last element of `b` which is less than or equal to `x`. If `y` is less than `lit[i]`, then `y` is less than `lit[i]`. If `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `lit[i]` is greater than `x`. Otherwise, `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x`, and if `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, then `a` now contains an additional element which is `lit[i]`. If `x` is less than or equal to `y`, then if `x` is equal to `y`, then `a` is a list of integers with one more element than before. If `x` is less than `y`, then if `x` is greater than or equal to the `i-th` element of `lit`, `x` is equal to the `i-th` element of `lit`. If `x` is less than the `i-th` element of `lit`, then if the `i-th` element of `lit` is greater than `y`, `x` is equal to the `i-th` element of `lit`. If `y` is greater than or equal to the `i-th` element of `lit` and the `i-th` element of `lit` is greater than `x`, then `y` is equal to the `i-th` element of `lit`. Otherwise, `y` remains unchanged. The current value of `x` is either less than or equal to the current value of `y` or greater than `y`. The current value of the `i-th` element of `lit` is either less than or equal to `y`. `n` must be greater than 1. If `x` is greater than `y`, then `b` now contains an additional element which is `lit[i]`. If `x` is less than or equal to `y`, then if `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, then `a` now contains an additional element which is `lit[i]`. If `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, then `a` now contains an additional element which is `lit[i]`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `b` now contains an additional element which is `lit[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is a positive integer greater than 2, lit is a list of integers, cp is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, i is 2. a is a list of integers and is not empty. If a was originally empty, then the current value of x is infinity. Otherwise, the current value of x is the last element of a. If b is empty, then y is infinity. Otherwise, b is a non-empty list and the current value of y is the last element of b. If x is greater than y, then b now contains an additional element which is lit[i]. If x is less than or equal to y, then if x is greater than or equal to lit[i], then a now contains an additional element which is lit[i]. If lit[i] is greater than y, then a now contains an additional element which is lit[i]. If y is greater than or equal to lit[i] and lit[i] is greater than x, then b now contains an additional element which is lit[i].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
