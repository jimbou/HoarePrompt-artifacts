Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `x` is the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is positive infinity, `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is positive infinity, `s` is 0.**

In this output state, all the variables from the initial state remain unchanged, and a new variable `s` is introduced with a value of 0. The values of `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `x`, and `y` are still valid and unchanged.
