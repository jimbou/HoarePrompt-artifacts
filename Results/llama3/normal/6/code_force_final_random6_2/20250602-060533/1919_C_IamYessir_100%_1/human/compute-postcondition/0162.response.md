The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and `x` is the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is positive infinity. If the length of `b` is 0, then `y` is positive infinity. Otherwise, `b` is a list with at least one element and `y` is the last element of `b`. If `x` is greater than `y`, then if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, `b` has at least two elements and `y` is the element at index `i` in the list `lit`. If `y` is less than `lit[i]`, then `y` is less than `lit[i]`. If `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `y` is equal to `lit[i]`. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x`, then `a` has at least two elements and `x` is equal to `lit[i]`. If `x` is less than or equal to `y`, then if `x` equals `y`, `a` has at least two elements and `x` is the i-th element of `lit`. If `x` is less than `y`, then if `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, `a` has at least two elements and `x` is the last element of `a` which is `lit[i]`. If `x` is strictly less than `lit[i]`, then `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y`, and if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `b` is a list with at least two elements, the last element of `b` is `lit[i]`, and `y` is `lit[i]`.**
