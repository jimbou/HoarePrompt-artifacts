Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is the last element of `a`, `b` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `y` is the last element of `b`. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is the number of times the value of `a[i]` is greater than the value of `a[i - 1]` for all `i` in the range from 1 to `len(a) - 1` plus 3. Otherwise, `s` is the number of times the value of `a[i]` is greater than the value of `a[i - 1]` for all `i` in the range from 1 to `len(a) - 1` plus 2.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `s` has been incremented by 1. The conditions for `s` remain the same, but the value has been increased by 1.
