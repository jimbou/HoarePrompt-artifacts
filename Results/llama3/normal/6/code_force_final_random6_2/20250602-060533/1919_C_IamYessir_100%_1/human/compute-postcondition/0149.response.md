Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least two elements and `x` is the last element of `a` which is `lit[i]`, `b` is a list with at least one element and `y` is the last element of `b`. Additionally, `x` is less than `y` and `x` is not equal to `y`. The current value of `x` is greater than or equal to the current value of `lit[i]`.**

In this output state, the list `a` now has at least two elements, and the last element of `a` is `lit[i]`, which is also the current value of `x`. The other variables remain unchanged.
