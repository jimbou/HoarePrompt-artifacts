Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least two elements and `x` is the last element of `a` which is `lit[i]`, `b` is a list with at least one element and `y` is the last element of `b`. The current value of `x` is equal to `lit[i]`. `y` is less than `lit[i]`. `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x`. Additionally, the current value of `x` is equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n`, `cp`, `i`, `lit`, `b`, and `y` remains the same. The list `a` now has at least two elements and its last element is `lit[i]`, which is also the new value of `x`. The relationship between `x`, `y`, and `lit[i]` is updated accordingly, with `x` being equal to `lit[i]`, and `lit[i]` being greater than `y`.
