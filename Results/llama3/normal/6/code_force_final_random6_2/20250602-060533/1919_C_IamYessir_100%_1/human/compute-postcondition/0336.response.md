Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `b` is a list of integers, `x` is either positive infinity or the last element of `a`, `y` is either positive infinity or the last element of `b`. If `a[2]` is greater than `a[1]`, then `i` is 2 and `s` is 2. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
