Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is `n`, `s` is undefined. `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers. `x` is either positive infinity or the last element of `a`, `y` is either positive infinity or the last element of `b`.**

This output state means that after the loop executes all the iterations, the values of `n`, `lit`, `cp`, and `s` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has executed `n` times. The lists `a` and `b` contain integers, and the values of `x` and `y` are either positive infinity or the last elements of `a` and `b`, respectively.
