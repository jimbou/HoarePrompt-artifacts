Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `s` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the last element of `a`, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is infinity. The current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `a[i - 1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `s` being equal to 1. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and properties. The condition that the current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `a[i - 1]` still holds true.
