Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 0. `a` is a list of integers and is not empty, and `x` is the last element of `a`. `b` is a non-empty list and `y` is the last element of `b`. The current value of `x` is less than the current value of `y`. The current value of `x` is less than the current value of `lit[i]`. The current value of `lit[i]` is less than or equal to the current value of `y`. Additionally, the current value of `y` is greater than or equal to the current value of `lit[i]`, and the current value of `lit[i]` is greater than the current value of `x`.**
