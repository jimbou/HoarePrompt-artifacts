Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer greater than 2, lit is a list of integers, cp is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, i is 2. a is a list of integers and is not empty. If a was originally empty, then the current value of x is infinity. Otherwise, the current value of x is the last element of a. If b is empty, then y is infinity. Otherwise, b is a non-empty list and the current value of y is the last element of b. If x is greater than y, then b now contains an additional element which is lit[i]. If x is less than or equal to y, then if x is greater than or equal to lit[i], then a now contains an additional element which is lit[i]. If lit[i] is greater than y, then a now contains an additional element which is lit[i]. If y is greater than or equal to lit[i] and lit[i] is greater than x, then b now contains an additional element which is lit[i].***
