Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `y` is the last element of `b`. If `lit` is an empty list, then `x` is positive infinity. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `lit`.**

In this output state, the value of `y` is assigned the last element of `b`, but the value of `b` is unknown. The values of the other variables are not affected. The condition that if `lit` is an empty list, then `x` is positive infinity, otherwise, `x` is the last element of `lit` is still valid.
