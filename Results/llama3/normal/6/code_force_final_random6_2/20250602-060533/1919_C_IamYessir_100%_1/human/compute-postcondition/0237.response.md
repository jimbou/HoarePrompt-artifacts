To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `i` is undefined, we need to define it and set it to the starting value of the range, which is 0.

State: **`n` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `x` is positive infinity, `y` is positive infinity, `s` is undefined, stdin contains no input**
