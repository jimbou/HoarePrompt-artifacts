Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `s` is undefined, `x` is either positive infinity or the last element of `a`, and `y` is either positive infinity or the last element of `b`. If `b` is an empty list, then `a` is either an empty list or a list of integers that is not empty and has one more element which is the first element of `lit`. If `b` is not an empty list, then `a` is either an empty list or a list of integers that is not empty and has one more element which is the first element of `lit`. Additionally, `x` is equal to `y`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n`, `lit`, `cp`, and `s` remains unchanged. The value of `i` is still 0. The value of `x` and `y` is still either positive infinity or the last element of `a` and `b` respectively, and they are still equal. The list `a` now has one more element which is the first element of `lit`. The list `b` remains unchanged.
