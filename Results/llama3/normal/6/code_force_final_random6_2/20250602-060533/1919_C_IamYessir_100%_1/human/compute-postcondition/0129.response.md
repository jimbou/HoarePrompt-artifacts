Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `b` is a list with at least one element, `y` is the last element of `b`, `s` is undefined, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and `x` is the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is positive infinity.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been updated to be the last element of list `b`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` and the variable `x` are still dependent on the length of `a`, and their values are determined accordingly.
