Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `s` is undefined, `b` is a list of integers that is not empty, `y` is the last element of `b` which is equal to `lit[i]`, `a` is either an empty list or a list of integers that is not empty and has one more element which is the first element of `lit`.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to include the current element of `lit` at index `i`, which is `lit[i]`. As a result, `y` is now equal to `lit[i]`. The value of `a` remains either an empty list or a list of integers that is not empty and has one more element which is the first element of `lit`. The values of `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged.
