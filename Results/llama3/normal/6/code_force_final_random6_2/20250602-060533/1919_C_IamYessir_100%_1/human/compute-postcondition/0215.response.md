Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `b` is a list of integers, `x` is the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is positive infinity, `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is positive infinity, `s` is 1 if `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, otherwise `s` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `s` is now 1, regardless of whether `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]` or not.
