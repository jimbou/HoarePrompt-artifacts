Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is the last element of `a`, `b` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `y` is the last element of `b`. If the value of `b[i]` is greater than the value of `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is the number of times the value of `a[i]` is greater than the value of `a[i - 1]` for all `i` in the range from 1 to `len(a) - 1` plus 1. Otherwise, `s` remains the number of times the value of `a[i]` is greater than the value of `a[i - 1]` for all `i` in the range from 1 to `len(a) - 1`.***
