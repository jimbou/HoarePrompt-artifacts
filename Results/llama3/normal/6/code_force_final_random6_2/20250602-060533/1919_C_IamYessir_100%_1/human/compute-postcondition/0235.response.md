State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(b)-1`, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `x` is the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is positive infinity, `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is positive infinity. `s` is the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the second element is greater than the first plus the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `b` where the second element is greater than the first, and the value of `s` is being printed**
