Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `s` is undefined, `b` is either an empty list or a list of integers that is not empty, `a` is either an empty list or a list of integers that is not empty and contains `lit[i]`, `x` is either positive infinity or the last element of `a` which is `lit[i]`, `y` is either positive infinity or the last element of `b` and is greater than `lit[i]`.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to include the current element of `lit` at index `i`. The values of `x` and `y` are still dependent on the values of `a` and `b`, respectively, but `x` is now equal to `lit[i]` since it is the last element of `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
