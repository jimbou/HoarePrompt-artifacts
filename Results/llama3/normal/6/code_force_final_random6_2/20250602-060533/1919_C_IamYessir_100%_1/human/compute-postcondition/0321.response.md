Output State: **The values of `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `i`, `s`, `a`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. `b` is a list of integers that is not empty and contains `lit[i]` as its last element.**

In this output state, the values of most variables remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is in the variable `b`, which is now a list of integers that is not empty and contains `lit[i]` as its last element. This means that the code has appended the value of `lit[i]` to the end of the list `b`. The other variables, including `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `i`, `s`, `a`, `x`, and `y`, retain their original values.
