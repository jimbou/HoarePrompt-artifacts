Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `a` has at least one element and its last element is `lit[i]`, `b` is a list with at least one element, `x` is `lit[i]`, `y` is the last element of `b` if the length of `b` is not 0, otherwise `y` is positive infinity.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to include the element at index `i` of the list `lit`. The value of `x` is now equal to `lit[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
