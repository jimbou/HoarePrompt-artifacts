Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, lit is a list of integers, cp is 0, i is undefined, a is an empty list, x is undefined, b is an empty list, y is undefined, s is undefined, stdin contains no input
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if len(a) == 0:
        x = float('inf')
    else:
        x = a[-1]
    if len(b) == 0:
        y = float('inf')
    else:
        y = b[-1]
    if x > y:
        if y >= lit[i]:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
    elif x == y:
        a.append(lit[i])
    elif x < y:
        if x >= lit[i]:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and `x` is the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is positive infinity. If the length of `b` is 0, then `y` is positive infinity. Otherwise, `b` is a list with at least one element and `y` is the last element of `b`. If `x` is greater than `y`, then if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, `b` has at least two elements and `y` is the element at index `i` in the list `lit`. If `y` is less than `lit[i]`, then `y` is less than `lit[i]`. If `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `y` is equal to `lit[i]`. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x`, then `a` has at least two elements and `x` is equal to `lit[i]`. If `x` is less than or equal to `y`, then if `x` equals `y`, `a` has at least two elements and `x` is the i-th element of `lit`. If `x` is less than `y`, then if `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, `a` has at least two elements and `x` is the last element of `a` which is `lit[i]`. If `x` is strictly less than `lit[i]`, then `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y`, and if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `b` is a list with at least two elements, the last element of `b` is `lit[i]`, and `y` is `lit[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1. If `a` is an empty list, then `x` is positive infinity, `b` is a list with at least one element, and `y` is the last element of `b` if the length of `b` is not 0, otherwise `y` is positive infinity. If `a` is not empty, then `x` is the last element of `a`. If the length of `b` is 0, then `y` is positive infinity. Otherwise, `b` is a list with at least one element and `y` is the last element of `b`. If `x` is greater than `y`, then if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, `b` has at least two elements and `y` is the element at index `i` in the list `lit`. If `y` is less than `lit[i]`, then `y` is less than `lit[i]`. If `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `y` is equal to `lit[i]`. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x`, then `a` has at least two elements and `x` is equal to `lit[i]`. If `x` is less than or equal to `y`, then if `x` equals `y`, `a` has at least two elements and `x` is the i-th element of `lit`. If `x` is less than `y`, then if `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, `a` has at least two elements and `x` is the last element of `a` which is `lit[i]`. If `x` is strictly less than `lit[i]`, then `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y`, and if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `b` is a list with at least two elements, the last element of `b` is `lit[i]`, and `y` is `lit[i]`. If `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, then `a` has at least one element and its last element is `lit[i]`, `b` is a list with at least one element, `x` is `lit[i]`, and `y` is the last element of `b` if the length of `b` is not 0, otherwise `y` is positive infinity. If `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, then `b` has at least two elements and its last element is `lit[i]`, `y` is `lit[i]`, `x` is either the last element of `a` or positive infinity, and `a` is either an empty list or a list with at least two elements. If `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, then `a` has at least two elements and its last element is `lit[i]`. If `x` is less than `y`, then `a` has at least two elements and its last element is `lit[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2. `x` is positive infinity if `lit` is an empty list, otherwise `x` is the last element of `lit`. `y` is positive infinity if `b` is an empty list, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`. If `x` is greater than `y`, then if `y` is greater than or equal to the element at index `i` in `lit`, then `b` is a list with one more element than before, `y` is the element at index 2 of `lit`. Otherwise, if the element at index `i` in `lit` is greater than `x`, then `b` is a list of integers with the last element of `lit` appended to it and `y` is the last element of `lit` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is positive infinity. If `x` is greater than or equal to the element at index `i` in `lit` and the element at index `i` in `lit` is greater than `y`, then `a` is a list with the last element of `lit` appended to it. If `lit` is an empty list, then `x` is positive infinity. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `lit`. If `x` is not greater than `y`, then if `x` equals `y`, then `a` is a list with an additional element, which is the third element of `lit`. If `x` is less than `y`, then if `x` is greater than or equal to the third element of `lit`, then `a` is a list that contains the third element of `lit`. If `x` is less than the third element of `lit`, then one of the following happens: if the third element of `lit` is greater than `y`, then `a` is a list that contains the third element of `lit`. If `y` is greater than or equal to the third element of `lit` and the third element of `lit` is greater than `x`, then `b` is a list that contains the third element of `lit` and `y` is the third element of `lit`. Otherwise, no changes are made. If `x` is not less than `y`, then no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
