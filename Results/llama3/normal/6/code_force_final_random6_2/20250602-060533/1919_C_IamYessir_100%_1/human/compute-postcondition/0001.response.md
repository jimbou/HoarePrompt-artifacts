The code snippet reads two lines of input from stdin: the first line is assigned to the variable `n`, and the second line is split into a list of integers and assigned to the variable `lit`. The variables `a` and `b` are initialized as empty lists, and the variable `cp` is set to 0.

Since `input()` must be greater than 0, the value of `n` is a positive integer. The value of `lit` is a list of integers.

The variables `a`, `b`, and `cp` are not affected by the input values, so their initial values remain the same.

Output State: **n is a positive integer, lit is a list of integers, a is an empty list, b is an empty list, cp is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs**
