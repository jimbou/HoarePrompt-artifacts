Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `x` is either positive infinity or the last element of `a`, `y` is either positive infinity or the last element of `b`, `i` is 2, `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus one, and if `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been incremented by 1, indicating that an additional instance of an element in `a` being greater than its previous element has been found. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and properties.
