Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 0. `a` is a list of integers and is not empty, and the current value of `x` is the last element of `a` which is greater than the last element of `b` (y). `b` is a non-empty list and the current value of `y` is the last element of `b` which is less than `x`. Additionally, `y` is less than `lit[i]`. `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x`. The current value of `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`.***
