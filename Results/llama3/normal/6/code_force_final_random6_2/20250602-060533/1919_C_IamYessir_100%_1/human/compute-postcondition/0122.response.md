Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `x` is positive infinity, `b` is an empty list, `y` is undefined, `s` is undefined, stdin contains no input, and the length of `a` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been updated to positive infinity, while all other variables remain unchanged. The length of `a` is still 0, and stdin still contains no input.
