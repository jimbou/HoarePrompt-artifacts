The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and b, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `b`. If `i` is less than `len(b)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `b` must have at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `b` must have at least 3 elements.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is positive infinity, `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is positive infinity. If the current value of `b[i]` is greater than the current value of `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the second element is greater than the first plus 1. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged.**
