Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 1. `a` is a list of integers and is not empty, and the current value of `x` is infinity. `b` is a non-empty list and the current value of `y` is the last element of `b`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, then the last element of `b` is the element at index `i` in `lit` which is less than or equal to infinity, and `y` is the last element of `b` which is less than or equal to infinity. If `y` is less than `lit[i]`, then `y` is less than `lit[i]`. If `lit[i]` is greater than infinity, then `lit[i]` is greater than infinity. Otherwise, `lit[i]` is less than or equal to infinity, and if infinity is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, then `a` now contains an additional element which is `lit[i]`. If infinity is less than or equal to `y`, then if infinity is equal to `y`, then `a` is a list of integers with one more element than before. If infinity is less than `y`, then if infinity is greater than or equal to the `i-th` element of `lit`, infinity is equal to the `i-th` element of `lit`. If infinity is less than the `i-th` element of `lit`, then if the `i-th` element of `lit` is greater than `y`, infinity is equal to the `i-th` element of `lit`. If `y` is greater than or equal to the `i-th` element of `lit` and the `i-th` element of `lit` is greater than infinity, then `y` is equal to the `i-th` element of `lit`. Otherwise, `y` remains unchanged. The current value of infinity is greater than the current value of `y`. The current value of the `i-th` element of `lit` is either less than or equal to `y`. `n` must be greater than 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `x` is now infinity. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to `x` and `y` are updated based on the new value of `x`. The list `a` may contain an additional element if certain conditions are met. The value of `y` remains unchanged unless certain conditions are met. The value of `n` is still greater than 1.
