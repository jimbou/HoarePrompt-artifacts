To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `b`. The loop will execute if `b` has at least 2 elements, since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `len(b)`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `b` to ensure it has at least 2 elements.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is the last element of `a`, `b` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `y` is the last element of `b`, `s` is the number of times the value of `a[i]` is greater than the value of `a[i - 1]` for all `i` in the range from 1 to `len(a) - 1`.**
