Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `b` is a list with at least two elements, `y` is the last element of `b` which is `lit[i]`. If `a` is an empty list, then `x` is positive infinity. If `a` is not empty, then `x` is the last element of `a`. If `x` is greater than `y`, then `y` is less than `lit[i]`. If `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `y` is equal to `lit[i]`. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x`, then `a` has at least two elements and `x` is equal to `lit[i]`. If `x` is less than or equal to `y`, then if `x` equals `y`, `a` has at least two elements and `x` is the i-th element of `lit`. If `x` is less than `y`, then if `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, `a` has at least two elements and `x` is the last element of `a` which is `lit[i]`. If `x` is strictly less than `lit[i]`, then `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y`, and if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `b` is a list with at least two elements, the last element of `b` is `lit[i]`, and `y` is `lit[i]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains an integer greater than 1, `lit` is still a list of integers, `cp` is still 0, and `i` is still 1. The list `b` now has at least two elements, and its last element is `lit[i]`, which is also the value of `y`. The value of `x` depends on whether `a` is empty or not. If `a` is empty, `x` is positive infinity. If `a` is not empty, `x` is the last element of `a`. The relationship between `x` and `y` is also updated based on their values.
