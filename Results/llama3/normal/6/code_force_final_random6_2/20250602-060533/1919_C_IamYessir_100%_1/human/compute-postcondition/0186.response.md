Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `x` is positive infinity**.

In this output state, the values of `n`, `lit`, `cp`, and `i` remain unchanged from the initial state. The only change is the introduction of a new variable `x`, which is assigned the value of positive infinity (`float('inf')`).
