Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `s` is undefined. `b` is either an empty list or a list of integers that is not empty, `a` is either an empty list or a list of integers that is not empty. `x` is either positive infinity or the last element of `a`, `y` is either positive infinity or the last element of `b`. If `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, then `a` contains `lit[i]`. In all cases, the current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `y`, and `y` is less than `lit[i]`, and `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x`.***
