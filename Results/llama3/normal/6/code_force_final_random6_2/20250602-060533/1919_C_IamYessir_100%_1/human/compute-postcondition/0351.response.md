Output State: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `x` is either positive infinity or the last element of `a`, `y` is either positive infinity or the last element of `b`, `i` is equal to the length of `b`, `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element, plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element.*

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the variables `i` and `s`. The variable `i` is now equal to the length of `b`, and the variable `s` is the sum of the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element and the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element.
