Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `b` is a list of integers, `x` is either positive infinity or the last element of `a`, `y` is either positive infinity or the last element of `b`. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, then `i` is 1 and `s` is 1. Otherwise, the values of `i` and `s` remain unchanged.***
