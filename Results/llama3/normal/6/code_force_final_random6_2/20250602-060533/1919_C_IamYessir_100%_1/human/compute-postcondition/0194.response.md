Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `a` is a list with the last element of `lit` appended to it, `y` is positive infinity if `b` is an empty list, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`. If `lit` is an empty list, then `x` is positive infinity. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `lit`**.

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated by appending the last element of `lit` to it. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. Note that the value of `a` is now a list with the last element of `lit` appended to it, which means that `a` now contains at least one element.
