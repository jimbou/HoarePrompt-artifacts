Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `s` is undefined. If `b` is an empty list, then `a` is either an empty list or a list of integers that is not empty, and `x` is either positive infinity or the last element of `a`, and `y` is positive infinity. If `b` is not an empty list, then `y` is the last element of `b`, and `a` is either an empty list or a list of integers that is not empty, and `x` is either positive infinity or the last element of `a`. Additionally, `x` is less than `y`.***
