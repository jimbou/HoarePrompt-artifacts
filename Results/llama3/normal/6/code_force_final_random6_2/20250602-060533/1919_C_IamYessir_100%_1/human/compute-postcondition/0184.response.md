Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1. If `a` is an empty list, then `x` is positive infinity, `b` is a list with at least one element, and `y` is the last element of `b` if the length of `b` is not 0, otherwise `y` is positive infinity. If `a` is not empty, then `x` is the last element of `a`. If the length of `b` is 0, then `y` is positive infinity. Otherwise, `b` is a list with at least one element and `y` is the last element of `b`. If `x` is greater than `y`, then if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, `b` has at least two elements and `y` is the element at index `i` in the list `lit`. If `y` is less than `lit[i]`, then `y` is less than `lit[i]`. If `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `y` is equal to `lit[i]`. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x`, then `a` has at least two elements and `x` is equal to `lit[i]`. If `x` is less than or equal to `y`, then if `x` equals `y`, `a` has at least two elements and `x` is the i-th element of `lit`. If `x` is less than `y`, then if `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, `a` has at least two elements and `x` is the last element of `a` which is `lit[i]`. If `x` is strictly less than `lit[i]`, then `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y`, and if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `b` is a list with at least two elements, the last element of `b` is `lit[i]`, and `y` is `lit[i]`. If `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, then `a` has at least one element and its last element is `lit[i]`, `b` is a list with at least one element, `x` is `lit[i]`, and `y` is the last element of `b` if the length of `b` is not 0, otherwise `y` is positive infinity. If `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, then `b` has at least two elements and its last element is `lit[i]`, `y` is `lit[i]`, `x` is either the last element of `a` or positive infinity, and `a` is either an empty list or a list with at least two elements. If `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, then `a` has at least two elements and its last element is `lit[i]`. If `x` is less than `y`, then `a` has at least two elements and its last element is `lit[i]`.***
