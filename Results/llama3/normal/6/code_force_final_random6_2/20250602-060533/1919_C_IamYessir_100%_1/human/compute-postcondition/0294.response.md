Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `s` is undefined, `a` contains `lit[i]`, `b` is a list of integers that is not empty, `y` is the last element of `b`, `x` is either less than `y` or greater than `y`.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to include `lit[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `x` is either less than `y` or greater than `y`, depending on the previous values of `x` and `y`. The value of `y` is still the last element of `b`, which is a list of integers that is not empty.
