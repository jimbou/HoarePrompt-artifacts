Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers and is not empty, `x` is the last element of `a` which is greater than the last element of `b`, `b` is a non-empty list, `y` is the last element of `b` which is less than `x`, `y` is less than `lit[i]`, and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated by appending the current value of `lit[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `x` and `y` has been updated to reflect the new value of `b`. Specifically, `y` is now the last element of `b` which is less than `x`, and `x` is still the last element of `a` which is greater than the last element of `b`. Additionally, `y` is still less than `lit[i]`, and `lit[i]` is still greater than `x`.
