Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least two elements and `x` is the second last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is positive infinity. If the length of `b` is 0, then `y` is positive infinity. Otherwise, `b` is a list with at least one element and `y` is the last element of `b`. Additionally, `x` is less than `y` and `x` is not equal to `y`. The current value of `x` is strictly less than the current value of `y`. The last element of `a` is `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than the current value of `y`.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated by appending `lit[i]` to it. The value of `x` has also been updated to be the second last element of `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `x` and `y` remains the same, with `x` being strictly less than `y`. The relationship between `lit[i]` and `y` also remains the same, with `lit[i]` being greater than `y`.
