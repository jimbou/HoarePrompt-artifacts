Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `b` is an empty list, `y` is undefined, `s` is undefined, stdin contains no input. If the length of `a` is 0, then `x` is positive infinity. Otherwise, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and `x` is the last element of `a`. The current value of `b` is an empty list.***
