Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `x` is positive infinity, `b` is a list with at least one element, `y` is the last element of `b` if the length of `b` is not 0, otherwise `y` is positive infinity.**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been updated to positive infinity, regardless of its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged, and their relationships and constraints specified in the initial state still hold.
