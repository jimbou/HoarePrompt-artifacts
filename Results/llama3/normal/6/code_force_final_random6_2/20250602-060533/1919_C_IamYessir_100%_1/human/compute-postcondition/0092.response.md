Output State: **n is a positive integer, lit is a list of integers, cp is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, i is n. a is a list of integers and is not empty. If a was originally empty, then the current value of x is infinity. Otherwise, the current value of x is the last element of a. If b is empty, then y is infinity. Otherwise, b is a non-empty list and the current value of y is the last element of b. If x is greater than y, then b now contains an additional element which is lit[i]. If x is less than or equal to y, then if x is greater than or equal to lit[i], then a now contains an additional element which is lit[i]. If lit[i] is greater than y, then a now contains an additional element which is lit[i]. If y is greater than or equal to lit[i] and lit[i] is greater than x, then b now contains an additional element which is lit[i].**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop has finished executing, and the value of `i` is now equal to `n`. The lists `a` and `b` have been updated according to the conditions in the loop body. If `a` was originally empty, the value of `x` is infinity. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `a`. If `b` is empty, the value of `y` is infinity. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`. The elements of `lit` have been processed and added to either `a` or `b` based on the conditions in the loop body. The values of `n`, `lit`, `cp`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
