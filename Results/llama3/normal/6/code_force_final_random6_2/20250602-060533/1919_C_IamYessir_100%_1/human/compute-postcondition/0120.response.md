To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` should be initialized to the starting value of the range, which is 0.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `x` is undefined, `b` is an empty list, `y` is undefined, `s` is undefined, stdin contains no input**
