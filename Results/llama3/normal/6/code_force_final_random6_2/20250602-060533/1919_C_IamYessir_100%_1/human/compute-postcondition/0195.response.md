Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `y` is positive infinity if `b` is an empty list, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`. If `lit` is an empty list, then `x` is positive infinity. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `lit`. If `x` is greater than or equal to the element at index `i` in `lit` and the element at index `i` in `lit` is greater than `y`, then `a` is a list with the last element of `lit` appended to it. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
