You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for understanding the program state at the start of the for loop. You will be provided with the program state after the previous iteration, which you need to modify. You will also see the for loop statement. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 10, `i` is 3, `n` must be  greater than 3.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.


Example Answer:
The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 4 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 4.
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 4, `n` must be  greater than 4**

Example 2:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 0, students_list is a list of students that must have at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list, index is 1 
```
for index, student in enumerate(students_list):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.


Example Answer:
The only objects in the loop head are variables  index, students  and list  students_list, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the student_list.  If the list has at least 3 students the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, students_list has at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list, index is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 students and the index is 2 and student is the trird student in the list.
State: **`total` is 0, students_list is a list of students that must have at least 3 students, student is the third student in the list, index is 3**


Your Task:
State at the end of the previous iteration: *`n` is a positive integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 0. `a` is a list of integers and is not empty, and the current value of `x` is the last element of `a`. `b` is a non-empty list and the current value of `y` is the last element of `b`. If `x` is greater than `y`, then `x` is greater than `y`, and if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, then the last element of `b` is the element at index `i` in `lit` which is less than or equal to `x`, and `y` is the last element of `b` which is less than or equal to `x`. If `y` is less than `lit[i]`, then `y` is less than `lit[i]`. If `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `lit[i]` is greater than `x`. Otherwise, `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x`, and if `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, then `a` now contains an additional element which is `lit[i]`. If `x` is less than or equal to `y`, then if `x` is equal to `y`, then `a` is a list of integers with one more element than before. If `x` is less than `y`, then if `x` is greater than or equal to the `i-th` element of `lit`, `x` is equal to the `i-th` element of `lit`. If `x` is less than the `i-th` element of `lit`, then if the `i-th` element of `lit` is greater than `y`, `x` is equal to the `i-th` element of `lit`. If `y` is greater than or equal to the `i-th` element of `lit` and the `i-th` element of `lit` is greater than `x`, then `y` is equal to the `i-th` element of `lit`. Otherwise, `y` remains unchanged. The current value of `x` is less than or equal to the current value of `y`. The current value of the `i-th` element of `lit` is either less than or equal to `y`.
```
for i in range(0, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.
