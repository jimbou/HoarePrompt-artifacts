Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `s` is undefined, `a` is either an empty list or a list of integers that is not empty and contains `lit[i]` as its last element, `b` is a list of integers that is not empty, `y` is either positive infinity or the last element of `b`, `x` is either undefined or the last element of `a` which is greater than `y` if `y` is less than `lit[i]`, or `x` is either undefined or the last element of `a` which is less than `y` if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to include `lit[i]` as its last element. The values of `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `i`, `s`, `b`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. The conditions related to `a`, `b`, `x`, and `y` are still valid, but the specific values of `x` and `y` may have changed depending on the previous values of `lit[i]` and `y`.
