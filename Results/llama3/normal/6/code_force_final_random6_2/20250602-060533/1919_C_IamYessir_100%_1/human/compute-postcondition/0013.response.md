Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 0. If `a` is an empty list, then `x` is positive infinity. Otherwise, `a` is a list of integers and is not empty, and the current value of `x` is the last element of `a` which is greater than the last element of `b` (y). If `b` is an empty list, then `y` is positive infinity. Otherwise, `b` is a non-empty list and the current value of `y` is the last element of `b` which is less than `x`.**
