Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is either positive infinity or the last element of `a`, `y` is either positive infinity or the last element of `b`, `i` is 1, `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
