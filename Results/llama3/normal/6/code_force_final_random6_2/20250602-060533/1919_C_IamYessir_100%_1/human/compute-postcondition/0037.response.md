Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 0. `a` is a list of integers and is not empty, and `x` is the last element of `a`. `b` is a non-empty list and `y` is the last element of `b` which is equal to `lit[i]`. The current value of `x` is less than the current value of `y`. The current value of `lit[i]` is equal to the current value of `y`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still a positive integer, `lit` is still a list of integers, `cp` is still 0, `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and `i` is still 0. `a` is still a list of integers and is not empty, and `x` is still the last element of `a`. `b` is still a non-empty list and `y` is still the last element of `b`, but now `y` is equal to `lit[i]`. The current value of `x` is still less than the current value of `y`, and the current value of `lit[i]` is equal to the current value of `y`.
