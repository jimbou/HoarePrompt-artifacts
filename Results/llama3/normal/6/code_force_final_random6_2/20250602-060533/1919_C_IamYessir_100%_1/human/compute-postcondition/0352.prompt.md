Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `x` is either positive infinity or the last element of `a`, `y` is either positive infinity or the last element of `b`, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(b)):
    if b[i] > b[i - 1]:
        s += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is either positive infinity or the last element of `a`, `y` is either positive infinity or the last element of `b`, `i` is 1, `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `x` is either positive infinity or the last element of `a`, `y` is either positive infinity or the last element of `b`, `i` is 2, `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element, plus one if `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `x` is either positive infinity or the last element of `a`, `y` is either positive infinity or the last element of `b`, `i` is 3. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element, plus two. Otherwise, `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element, plus one if `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
