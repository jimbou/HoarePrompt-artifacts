State: **`n` is a positive integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(b)`, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is the last element of `a`, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is the last element of `b`, `s` is the number of times the value of `a[i]` is greater than the value of `a[i - 1]` for all `i` in the range from 1 to `len(a) - 1` plus the number of times the value of `b[i]` is greater than the value of `b[i - 1]` for all `i` in the range from 1 to `len(b) - 1`**
