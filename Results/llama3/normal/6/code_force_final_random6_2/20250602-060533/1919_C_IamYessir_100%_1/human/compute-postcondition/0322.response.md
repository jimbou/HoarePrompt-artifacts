Postcondition: ***The values of `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `i`, `s`, `a`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. If `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `b` is a list of integers that is not empty and contains `lit[i]` as its last element. Otherwise, the values of `b` remain unchanged.***
