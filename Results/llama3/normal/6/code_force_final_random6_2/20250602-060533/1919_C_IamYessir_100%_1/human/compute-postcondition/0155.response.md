Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and `x` is the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is positive infinity. `b` is a list with at least two elements, the last element of `b` is `lit[i]`, `y` is `lit[i]`. The current value of `x` is strictly less than the current value of `y`. `x` is strictly less than `lit[i]`. `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y`. The current value of `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and the current value of `lit[i]` is greater than `x`**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to include the element at index `i` of `lit`, which is now the last element of `b`. The value of `y` has also been updated to be equal to the last element of `b`, which is `lit[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
