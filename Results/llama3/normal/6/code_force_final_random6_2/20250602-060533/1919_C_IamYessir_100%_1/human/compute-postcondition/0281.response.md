Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `s` is undefined. `b` is either an empty list or a list of integers that is not empty, `a` is either an empty list or a list of integers that is not empty. `x` is positive infinity, `y` is either positive infinity or the last element of `b`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, then `b` is a list of integers that is not empty, `y` is the last element of `b` which is equal to `lit[i]`. If `y` is less than `lit[i]`, then `b` is a list of integers that is not empty, `y` is the last element of `b`, and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`. If `y` is less than `lit[i]`, then `a` contains `lit[i]`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, then `a` is either an empty list or a list of integers that is not empty and has one more element which is the first element of `lit`.**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been changed to positive infinity, and the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `y`, `b`, and `a` are still valid, but now `x` is always positive infinity.
