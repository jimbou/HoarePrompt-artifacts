Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `s` is undefined, `b` is a list of integers that is not empty, the current value of `y` is the last element of `b`, `a` is either an empty list or a list of integers that is not empty, the current value of `x` is either positive infinity or the last element of `a`, the current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `y`, the current value of `y` is less than the current value of `lit[i]`, and the current value of `lit[i]` is greater than the current value of `x`.**

In this output state, the list `b` is no longer empty, and its last element is the current value of `y`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the relationships between `x`, `y`, and `lit[i]` are still valid.
