Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and `x` is the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is positive infinity. `b` is a list with at least one element and `y` is the last element of `b`. The current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `y`. Additionally, the current value of `y` is greater than or equal to the element at index `i` in the list `lit`.**
