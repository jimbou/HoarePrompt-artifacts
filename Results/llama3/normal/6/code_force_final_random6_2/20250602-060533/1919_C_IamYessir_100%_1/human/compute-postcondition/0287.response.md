Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `s` is undefined, `b` is a list of integers that is not empty, `y` is the last element of `b` which is equal to `lit[i]`, `a` is either an empty list or a list of integers that is not empty and has one more element which is the first element of `lit`.**

The code appends `lit[i]` to the list `b`. Since `b` was previously either an empty list or a list of integers that is not empty, it is now a list of integers that is not empty. The value of `y` is updated to be the last element of `b`, which is now `lit[i]`. The values of `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `i`, `s`, and `a` remain unchanged.
