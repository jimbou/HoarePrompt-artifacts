Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 0. `a` is a list of integers and is not empty, and `x` is the last element of `a`. `b` is a non-empty list and `y` is the last element of `b`. If `x` is greater than or equal to the `i-th` element of `lit`, then `x` is equal to the `i-th` element of `lit`. If `x` is less than the `i-th` element of `lit`, then if the `i-th` element of `lit` is greater than `y`, `x` is equal to the `i-th` element of `lit`. If `y` is greater than or equal to the `i-th` element of `lit` and the `i-th` element of `lit` is greater than `x`, then `y` is equal to the `i-th` element of `lit`. Otherwise, `y` remains unchanged. The current value of `x` is less than the current value of `y`. The current value of the `i-th` element of `lit` is either less than or equal to `y`.***
