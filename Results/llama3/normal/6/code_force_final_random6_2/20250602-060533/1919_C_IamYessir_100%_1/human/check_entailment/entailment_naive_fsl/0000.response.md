Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to split the array into two subsequences s and t such that every element of a is either in s or t. The current implementation has several issues:

1.  The conditions for appending elements to a and b are incorrect. For example, when x > y, the program checks if y >= lit[i] and then appends lit[i] to b. However, this is not the correct condition to check. The correct condition should be to check if lit[i] is less than or equal to y, and if so, append it to b.
2.  The program does not correctly handle the case when x == y. In this case, the program simply appends lit[i] to a, but it should actually check which subsequence (a or b) has the smaller last element and append lit[i] to that subsequence.
3.  The program does not correctly handle the case when x < y. In this case, the program checks if x >= lit[i] and then appends lit[i] to a, but it should actually check if lit[i] is less than or equal to x, and if so, append it to a.

Due to these issues, the program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty. For example, for the input [3, 1, 4, 1, 5], the program outputs 2, but the correct output should be 1.

To fix these issues, the program should be modified to correctly implement the logic to split the array into two subsequences s and t. The correct implementation should check the conditions correctly and append elements to the correct subsequences.
