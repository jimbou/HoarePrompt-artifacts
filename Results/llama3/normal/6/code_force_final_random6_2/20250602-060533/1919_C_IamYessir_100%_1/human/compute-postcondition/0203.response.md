Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2. If the third element of `lit` is greater than `y`, then `a` is a list that contains the third element of `lit`. If `y` is greater than or equal to the third element of `lit` and the third element of `lit` is greater than `x`, then `b` is a list that contains the third element of `lit` and `y` is the third element of `lit`. Otherwise, no changes are made. `x` is positive infinity if `lit` is an empty list, otherwise `x` is the last element of `lit`.***
