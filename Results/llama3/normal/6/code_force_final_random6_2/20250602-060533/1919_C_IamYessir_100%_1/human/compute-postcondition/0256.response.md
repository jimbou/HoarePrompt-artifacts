Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `s` is undefined, `b` is either an empty list or a list of integers that is not empty, `a` is either an empty list or a list of integers that is not empty and contains `lit[i]`, `x` is either positive infinity or the last element of `a`, `y` is either positive infinity or the last element of `b`. The current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `y`. Additionally, the current value of `y` is less than `lit[i]`. `lit[i]` is less than or equal to the current value of `x`. The current value of `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, and `lit[i]` is greater than the current value of `y`.**

In this output state, the list `a` now contains the element `lit[i]`, which is the current element being processed from the list `lit`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged, and the relationships between the variables are still valid. The current value of `x` is either positive infinity or the last element of `a`, which is now `lit[i]`. The current value of `y` is either positive infinity or the last element of `b`, which remains unchanged. The relationships between `x`, `y`, and `lit[i]` are still valid, with `x` being greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, and `lit[i]` being greater than `y`.
