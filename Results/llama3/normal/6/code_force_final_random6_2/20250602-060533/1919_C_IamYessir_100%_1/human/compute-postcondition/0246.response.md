Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `b` is a list of integers that is not empty, `y` is the last element of `b`, `s` is undefined, `a` is either an empty list or a list of integers that is not empty, `x` is either positive infinity or the last element of `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been updated to be the last element of the list `b`, which is not empty. The other variables remain unchanged, and their values are still valid as specified in the initial state.
