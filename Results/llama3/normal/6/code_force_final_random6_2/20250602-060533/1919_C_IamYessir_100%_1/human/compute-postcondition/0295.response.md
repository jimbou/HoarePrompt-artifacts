Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `s` is undefined, `a` contains `lit[i]`, `b` is a list of integers that is not empty, `y` is the last element of `b` which is equal to `lit[i]`, `x` is either less than or equal to `y` or greater than `y` and less than or equal to `lit[i]`.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to include `lit[i]`. The values of `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `i`, `s`, `b`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. The conditions related to `a`, `b`, `x`, and `y` have been updated to reflect the new value of `a`.
