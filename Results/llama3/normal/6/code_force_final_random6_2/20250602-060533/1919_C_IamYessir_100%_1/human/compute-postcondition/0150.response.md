Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and `x` is the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is positive infinity. If the length of `b` is 0, then `y` is positive infinity. Otherwise, `b` is a list with at least one element and `y` is the last element of `b`. Additionally, `x` is less than `y` and `x` is not equal to `y`. The current value of `x` is strictly less than the current value of `y`. `x` is strictly less than `lit[i]`***
