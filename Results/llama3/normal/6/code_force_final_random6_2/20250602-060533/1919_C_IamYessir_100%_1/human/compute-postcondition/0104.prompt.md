Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `s` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is `n`, `a` is a list of integers and is not empty, `x` is the last element of `a`, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is infinity. If `x` is greater than `y`, then `b` contains an additional element which is `lit[i]`. If `x` is less than or equal to `y`, then if `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, then `a` contains an additional element which is `lit[i]`. If `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, then `a` contains an additional element which is `lit[i]`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `b` contains an additional element which is `lit[i]`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    if a[i] > a[i - 1]:
        s += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the last element of `a`, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is infinity. If the current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is 1. Otherwise, `s` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is a positive integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the last element of `a`, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is infinity. If the current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is 2. Otherwise, `s` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is a positive integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `x` is the last element of `a`, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is infinity. If the current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is 3. Otherwise, `s` is 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
