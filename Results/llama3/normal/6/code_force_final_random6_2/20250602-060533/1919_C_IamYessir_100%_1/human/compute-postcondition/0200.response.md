Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `a` is a list that contains the third element of `lit`, `y` is positive infinity if `b` is an empty list, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`. If `lit` is an empty list, then `x` is positive infinity. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `lit`.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to include the third element of `lit`, which is accessed using the index `i` that is equal to 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
