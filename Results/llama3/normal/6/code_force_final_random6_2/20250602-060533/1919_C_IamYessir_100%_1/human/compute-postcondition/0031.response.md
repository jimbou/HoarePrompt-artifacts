Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers and is not empty, `x` is the last element of `a` which is the `i-th` element of `lit`, `b` is a non-empty list and `y` is the last element of `b`, `x` is less than `y`.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to include the `i-th` element of `lit`, which is also the new value of `x`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that `x` is now equal to the `i-th` element of `lit`, and it is still less than `y`.
