Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers and is not empty, `x` is the last element of `a` which is greater than the last element of `b`, `b` is a non-empty list and the last element of `b` is the element at index `i` in `lit` which is less than or equal to `x`, and `y` is the last element of `b` which is less than or equal to `x`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains a positive integer, and the list `lit` remains unchanged. The variable `cp` is still 0, and there are still multiple test cases minus 2 inputs in `stdin`. The index `i` is still 0. The list `a` is not empty, and the value of `x` is still the last element of `a` that is greater than the last element of `b`. The list `b` is now non-empty, and its last element is the element at index `i` in `lit`, which is less than or equal to `x`. The value of `y` is now the last element of `b`, which is less than or equal to `x`.
