Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `b` is an empty list, `y` is positive infinity, `s` is undefined. If `a` is an empty list, then `a` remains empty and `x` remains positive infinity. Otherwise, `a` is a list of integers that is not empty, `x` is the last element of `a`.**

The code sets `y` to positive infinity, but `y` was already positive infinity in the initial state. Therefore, the value of `y` does not change. The values of the other variables remain the same, and the stdin still contains no input.
