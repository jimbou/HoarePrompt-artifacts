Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `b` is an empty list, `y` is positive infinity, `s` is undefined. If the length of `a` is 0, then `x` is positive infinity. Otherwise, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and `x` is the last element of `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been updated to positive infinity, while the values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The list `a` and the variable `x` are still dependent on each other, with `x` being the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, or positive infinity if `a` is empty.
