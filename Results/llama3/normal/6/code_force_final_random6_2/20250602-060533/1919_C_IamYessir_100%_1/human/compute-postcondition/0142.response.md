Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and `x` is the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is positive infinity. `b` is a list with at least one element and `y` is the last element of `b`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, then `b` has at least two elements and `y` is the element at index `i` in the list `lit`. The current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `y`. If `y` is less than `lit[i]`, then `y` is less than `lit[i]`. If `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `y` is equal to `lit[i]`. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x`, then `a` has at least two elements and `x` is equal to `lit[i]`.***
