Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `s` is undefined, `b` is either an empty list or a list of integers that is not empty, `a` is either an empty list or a list of integers that is not empty and contains `lit[i]` as its last element, `x` is either positive infinity or `lit[i]`, and `y` is either positive infinity or the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to include `lit[i]` as its last element. The values of `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `i`, `s`, `b`, `x`, and `y` remain the same as in the initial state. The relationship between `x` and `y` is still maintained, with `x` being less than `y`. Additionally, the relationship between `x` and `lit[i]` is still maintained, with `x` being greater than or equal to `lit[i]`.
