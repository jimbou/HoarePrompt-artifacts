The code prints the element at index `i` of the list `a`, where `i` is at least 1. Since the exact value of `i` is not provided, we can't determine the exact element that will be printed. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the element at index `i` of the list `a`.

Output: **the element at index i of the list a (where i is at least 1)**
