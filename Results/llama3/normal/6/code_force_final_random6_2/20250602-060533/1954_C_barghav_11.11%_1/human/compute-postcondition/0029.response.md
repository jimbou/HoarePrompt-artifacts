Based on the initial state, we know that `a` is a list of digits with at least `i` elements, `b` is a list of digits with a specific structure, `i` is 0, and all elements of `a` are printed (although this last part is not relevant to the print statement).

The print statement `print(b[i], end='')` will print the element at index `i` of the list `b`. Since `i` is 0, it will print the first element of `b`.

The first half of the elements of `b` are the maximum and minimum of the original elements of `a` and `b` respectively. Since `i` is 0, the first element of `b` will be the maximum of the original elements of `a`.

Therefore, the print statement will print the maximum of the original elements of `a`.

Output: **the maximum of the original elements of a**
