Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is a list of digits from the first pair of integers, b is a list of digits from the second pair of integers, stdin contains t-1 pairs of integers x and y
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if i <= len(a) // 2 - 1:
        n = min(a[i], b[i])
        m = max(a[i], b[i])
        a[i] = m
        b[i] = n
    else:
        n = min(a[i], b[i])
        m = max(a[i], b[i])
        a[i] = n
        b[i] = m


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is a list of digits from the first pair of integers and `b` is a list of digits from the second pair of integers. `i` is an index. If `i` is less than or equal to half the length of `a` minus 1, the ith element of `a` is the maximum of the original ith elements of `a` and `b`, and the ith element of `b` is the minimum of the original ith elements of `a` and `b`. If `i` is larger than half the length of `a` minus 1, the ith element of `a` is the minimum of the original element at index `i` and the element at index `i` in `b`, and the ith element of `b` is the maximum of the original element at index `i` in `a` and the element at index `i` in `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` and `b` are lists of digits where the first half of the elements are the maximum and minimum of the original elements of `a` and `b` respectively, and the second half of the elements are the minimum and maximum of the original elements of `a` and `b` respectively. `i` is an index plus 1. If `i` is less than or equal to half the length of `a` minus 1, the ith element of `a` is the maximum of the original ith elements of `a` and `b`, and the ith element of `b` is the minimum of the original ith elements of `a` and `b`. If `i` is larger than half the length of `a` minus 1, the ith element of `a` is the minimum of the original ith elements of `a` and `b`, and the ith element of `b` is the maximum of the original ith elements of `a` and `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` and `b` are lists of digits where the first half of the elements are the maximum and minimum of the original elements of `a` and `b` respectively, and the second half of the elements are the minimum and maximum of the original elements of `a` and `b` respectively. `i` is an index plus 2. If `i` is less than or equal to half the length of `a` minus 1, the ith element of `a` is the maximum of the original ith elements of `a` and `b`, and the ith element of `b` is the minimum of the original ith elements of `a` and `b`. If `i` is larger than half the length of `a` minus 1, the ith element of `a` is the minimum of the original ith elements of `a` and `b`, and the ith element of `b` is the maximum of the original ith elements of `a` and `b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
