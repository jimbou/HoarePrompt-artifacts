The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of `a`. If `i` is less than the length of `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is an index. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1.
State: **`a` is a list of digits from the first pair of integers and `b` is a list of digits from the second pair of integers. `i` is an index plus 1. If `i` is less than or equal to half the length of `a` minus 1, the ith element of `a` is the maximum of the original ith elements of `a` and `b`, and the ith element of `b` is the minimum of the original ith elements of `a` and `b`. If `i` is larger than half the length of `a` minus 1, the ith element of `a` is the minimum of the original element at index `i` and the element at index `i` in `b`, and the ith element of `b` is the maximum of the original element at index `i` in `a` and the element at index `i` in `b`.**
