Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of digits that must have at least `i` elements, `b` is a list of digits where the first half of the elements are the maximum and minimum of the original elements of `a` and `b` respectively, and the second half of the elements are the minimum and maximum of the original elements of `a` and `b` respectively, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, and all elements of the list `a` are printed, nothing is printed
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(b)):
    print(b[i], end='')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list of digits that must have at least `i` elements, `b` is a list of digits where the first half of the elements are the maximum and minimum of the original elements of `a` and `b` respectively, and the second half of the elements are the minimum and maximum of the original elements of `a` and `b` respectively, `i` is 0, and all elements of the list `a` are printed, nothing is printed, and the first element of the list `b` is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list of digits that must have at least `i` elements, `b` is a list of digits where the first half of the elements are the maximum and minimum of the original elements of `a` and `b` respectively, and the second half of the elements are the minimum and maximum of the original elements of `a` and `b` respectively, `i` is 1, all elements of the list `a` are printed, nothing is printed, the first and second elements of the list `b` are printed, and the second element of the list `b` is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of digits that must have at least 2 elements, `b` is a list of digits where the first half of the elements are the maximum and minimum of the original elements of `a` and `b` respectively, and the second half of the elements are the minimum and maximum of the original elements of `a` and `b` respectively, `i` is 2, all elements of the list `a` are printed, nothing is printed, the first and second elements of the list `b` are printed, and the second element of the list `b` is printed, and the third element of the list `b` which is the minimum of the original elements of `a` and `b` is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
