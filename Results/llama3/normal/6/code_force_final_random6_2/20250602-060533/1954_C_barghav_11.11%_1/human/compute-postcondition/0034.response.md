To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(len(b)):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of list `b`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `b` has at least 2 elements (since the first and second elements of `b` are printed).

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Additionally, `b` must have at least 3 elements for the loop to continue.

The state of `a` is not affected by the loop head, so it remains the same.

State: **`a` is a list of digits that must have at least 2 elements, `b` is a list of digits where the first half of the elements are the maximum and minimum of the original elements of `a` and `b` respectively, and the second half of the elements are the minimum and maximum of the original elements of `a` and `b` respectively, `i` is 2, all elements of the list `a` are printed, nothing is printed, the first and second elements of the list `b` are printed, and the second element of the list `b` is printed**
