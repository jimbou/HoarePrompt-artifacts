Output State: **a is a list of digits from the first pair of integers, b is a list of digits from the second pair of integers, stdin contains t-1 pairs of integers x and y**.

In this output state, `a` and `b` are lists of digits, each containing the digits from the first and second pairs of integers, respectively. The stdin still contains `t-1` pairs of integers, as only the first two pairs have been read and assigned to `a` and `b`.
