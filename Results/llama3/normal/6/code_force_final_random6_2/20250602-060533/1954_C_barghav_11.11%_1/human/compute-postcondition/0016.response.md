To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `a` has at least one element. Since `i` is equal to the length of `a`, we can adjust the state of `i` to be at least 1, and the state of `a` to have at least one element.

State: **`a` is a list of digits that must have at least 1 element, `b` is a list of digits where the first half of the elements are the maximum and minimum of the original elements of `a` and `b` respectively, and the second half of the elements are the minimum and maximum of the original elements of `a` and `b` respectively, `i` is at least 1**
