The code prints the element at index `i` of the list `b`. Since `i` is 1, it will print the second element of the list `b`. The list `b` is composed of the maximum and minimum of the original elements of `a` and `b` in the first half, and the minimum and maximum of the original elements of `a` and `b` in the second half. Therefore, the second element of `b` is the minimum of the original elements of `b`. 

Output: **the minimum of the original elements of b**
