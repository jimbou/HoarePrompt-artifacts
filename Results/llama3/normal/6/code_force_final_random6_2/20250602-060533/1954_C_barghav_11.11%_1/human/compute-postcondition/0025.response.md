Output State: **`a` is a list of digits that must have at least `i` elements, `b` is a list of digits where the first half of the elements are the maximum and minimum of the original elements of `a` and `b` respectively, and the second half of the elements are the minimum and maximum of the original elements of `a` and `b` respectively, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, and all elements of the list `a` are printed**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `a` is a list of digits with at least as many elements as its original length, `b` remains unchanged with its first half containing the maximum and minimum of the original elements of `a` and `b`, and its second half containing the minimum and maximum of the original elements of `a` and `b`. The variable `i` is equal to the length of `a`, and all elements of the list `a` have been printed.
