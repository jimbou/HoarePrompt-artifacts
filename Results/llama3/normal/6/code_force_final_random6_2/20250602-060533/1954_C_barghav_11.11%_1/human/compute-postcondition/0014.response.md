Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are lists of digits where the first half of the elements are the maximum and minimum of the original elements of `a` and `b` respectively, and the second half of the elements are the minimum and maximum of the original elements of `a` and `b` respectively. `i` is an index plus 2. If `i` is less than or equal to half the length of `a` minus 1, the ith element of `a` is the maximum of the original ith elements of `a` and `b`, and the ith element of `b` is the minimum of the original ith elements of `a` and `b`. If `i` is larger than half the length of `a` minus 1, the ith element of `a` is the minimum of the original ith elements of `a` and `b`, and the ith element of `b` is the maximum of the original ith elements of `a` and `b`.**
