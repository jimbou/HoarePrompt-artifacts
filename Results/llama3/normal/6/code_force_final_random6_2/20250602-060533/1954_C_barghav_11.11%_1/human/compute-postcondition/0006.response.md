Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of digits from the first pair of integers and `b` is a list of digits from the second pair of integers. `i` is an index. If `i` is less than or equal to half the length of `a` minus 1, the ith element of `a` is the maximum of the original ith elements of `a` and `b`, and the ith element of `b` is the minimum of the original ith elements of `a` and `b`. If `i` is larger than half the length of `a` minus 1, the ith element of `a` is the minimum of the original element at index `i` and the element at index `i` in `b`, and the ith element of `b` is the maximum of the original element at index `i` in `a` and the element at index `i` in `b`.***
