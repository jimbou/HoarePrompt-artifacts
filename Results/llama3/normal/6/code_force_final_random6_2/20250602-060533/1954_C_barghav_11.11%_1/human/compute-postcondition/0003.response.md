The code snippet swaps the values of `a[i]` and `b[i]` if `a[i]` is less than `b[i]`. 

Output State: **a is a list of digits from the first pair of integers with the ith element being the maximum of the original ith elements of a and b, b is a list of digits from the second pair of integers with the ith element being the minimum of the original ith elements of a and b, stdin contains t-1 pairs of integers x and y, i is less than or equal to half the length of a minus 1**
