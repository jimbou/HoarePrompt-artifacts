To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the list `a`. The loop will execute if `a` has at least one element. Since `a` is a list of digits from the first pair of integers, we can assume that the first pair of integers has been processed. The state of `b` is not relevant to the execution of the loop, as it is not used in the loop head. The state of `stdin` is also not relevant, as it is not used in the loop head.

State: **`a` is a list of digits from the first pair of integers that must have at least 1 element, `b` is a list of digits from the second pair of integers, stdin contains t-1 pairs of integers x and y, `i` is 0**
