Output State: **n is at least 1, k is a positive integer, nums is a deque of n-2 positive integers, ans is 0, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, x is a positive integer equal to the minimum of a and b.**

In this output state, the value of `n` is at least 1 because two elements were removed from the deque `nums`. The value of `k` remains unchanged as a positive integer. The deque `nums` now contains `n-2` positive integers because two elements were removed from it. The value of `ans` remains 0 as it was not modified by the code. The variables `a` and `b` are assigned the values of the removed elements from the deque `nums`, so they are positive integers. The variable `x` is assigned the minimum value between `a` and `b`, so it is also a positive integer.
