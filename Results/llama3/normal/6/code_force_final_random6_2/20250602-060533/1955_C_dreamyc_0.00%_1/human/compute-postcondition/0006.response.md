Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `k` is a positive integer, `nums` is a deque of `n-2` positive integers, `ans` is 0, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer equal to the minimum of `a` and `b`, and `k` is less than 2 times `x`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their initial values and properties, as the `break` statement only exits the innermost loop or if statement without modifying any variables. The relationship between `k` and `x` remains unchanged, and the deque `nums` still contains `n-2` positive integers.
