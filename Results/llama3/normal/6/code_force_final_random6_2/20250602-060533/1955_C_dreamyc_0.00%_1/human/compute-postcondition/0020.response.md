Output State: **n is at least 1, k is greater than or equal to -2x + 2, nums is a deque of at least 0 positive integers, a is a positive integer equal to a - x, b is a positive integer equal to b - x, x is a positive integer equal to the minimum of a and b, ans is either 0, 1, or 2 depending on the values of a and b.**

The code block modifies the values of `a`, `b`, and `k`. The first line subtracts the value of `x` from `a`, resulting in a new value for `a`. The second line subtracts the value of `x` from `b`, resulting in a new value for `b`. The third line subtracts twice the value of `x` from `k`, resulting in a new value for `k`. The values of `n`, `nums`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The value of `x` is not modified by the code, but its relationship with `a` and `b` is maintained.
