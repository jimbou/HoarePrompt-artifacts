Output State: **n is at least 1, k is greater than or equal to -2x + 2 (where x is the minimum of a and b), nums is a deque of at least 0 positive integers, a is a positive integer equal to the value that was at the beginning of nums minus the minimum of a and b, b is a positive integer equal to the value that was at the end of nums minus the minimum of a and b, x is a positive integer equal to the minimum of a and b, ans is either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 depending on the values of a and b.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `a`, `b`, and `k`. The first line subtracts the value of `x` from `a`, making it equal to the value that was at the beginning of `nums` minus the minimum of `a` and `b`. The second line subtracts the value of `x` from `b`, making it equal to the value that was at the end of `nums` minus the minimum of `a` and `b`. The third line subtracts twice the value of `x` from `k`, making it greater than or equal to `-2x + 2` (where `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`). The values of `n`, `nums`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
