Output State: **n is at least 1, k is greater than 0, nums is a deque of at least 0 positive integers, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, x is a positive integer equal to the minimum of a and b, ans is either 0, 1, or 2 depending on the values of a and b.**

The code snippet extracts the leftmost and rightmost elements from the deque `nums` and assigns them to `a` and `b`, respectively. It then calculates the minimum value between `a` and `b` and assigns it to `x`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is determined based on the values of `a` and `b`, but its exact value cannot be determined without knowing the specific values of `a` and `b`.
