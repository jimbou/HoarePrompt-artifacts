Output State: **n is at least 1, k is greater than 0, nums is a deque of at least 0 positive integers, a is a positive integer equal to the value that was at the beginning of nums, b is a positive integer equal to the value that was at the end of nums, x is a positive integer equal to the minimum of a and b, ans is either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 depending on the values of a and b, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables n, k, nums, a, b, x, and ans remain unchanged.
