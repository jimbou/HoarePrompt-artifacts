Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, nums is a deque of n positive integers, ans is 0
Code of the loop:
while k and len(nums) >= 2:
    a, b = nums.popleft(), nums.pop()
    x = min(a, b)
    if k >= 2 * x:
        a -= x
        b -= x
        k -= 2 * x
    else:
        break
    if a > 0:
        nums.appendleft(a)
    else:
        ans += 1
    if b > 0:
        nums.append(b)
    else:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is at least 1, k is a positive integer, nums is a deque of n-2, n-1 or n positive integers. If a > 0, then nums has a as the new leftmost element. If k is greater than or equal to 2 times x, then a and b are decreased by x. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If a is 0 and b is 0, then ans is 2. If a is 0 and b is greater than 0, then ans is 1. If a is greater than 0 and b is greater than 0, then nums has b as the new rightmost element and ans is 0. If a is greater than 0 and b is 0, then ans is 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *n is at least 1, k is greater than 0, nums is a deque of at least 0 positive integers, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, x is a positive integer equal to the minimum of a and b. If b > 0, then nums now contains the value of b at its end. If b is not greater than 0, then if a > 0 and k is greater than or equal to 2x, a and b are decreased by x. If a > 0 and k is less than 2x, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If a is not greater than 0 and k is greater than or equal to 2x, then a and b are decreased by x. If a is not greater than 0 and k is less than 2x, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. ans is either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 depending on the values of a and b.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: n is at least 1, k is greater than 0, nums is a deque of at least 0 positive integers, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, x is a positive integer equal to the minimum of a and b, ans is either 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 depending on the values of a and b. If a > 0 and k is greater than or equal to 2 times the minimum of a and b, then a and b are decreased by the minimum of a and b. If a > 0 but k is less than 2 times the minimum of a and b, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If a is not greater than 0, then a and b are decreased by the minimum of a and b if k is greater than or equal to 2 times the minimum of a and b, otherwise the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If b > 0, the deque nums now contains the positive integer b.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
