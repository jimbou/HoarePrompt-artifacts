Postcondition: ***n is at least 1, k is a positive integer, nums is a deque of n-2, n-1 or n positive integers. If a > 0, then nums has a as the new leftmost element. If k is greater than or equal to 2 times x, then a and b are decreased by x. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If a is 0 and b is 0, then ans is 2. If a is 0 and b is greater than 0, then ans is 1. If a is greater than 0 and b is greater than 0, then nums has b as the new rightmost element and ans is 0. If a is greater than 0 and b is 0, then ans is 0.***
