Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `k` is greater than 0, `nums` is a deque of at least 1 positive integers, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer equal to the minimum of `a` and `b`, `ans` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3 depending on the values of `a` and `b`, and the deque `nums` now contains the value of `b` at its end.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables maintain their initial properties, but the deque `nums` has been updated to include the value of `b` at its end. The values of `a`, `b`, `x`, `k`, and `ans` remain unchanged, and `n` is still at least 1.
