Output State: **n is at least 1, k is a positive integer, nums is a deque of n-1 or n positive integers. If a > 0, then nums has a as the new leftmost element. If k is greater than or equal to 2 times x, then a and b are decreased by x. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If a is 0, then ans is 1. Otherwise, ans is 0. The current value of b is greater than 0 and nums has b as the new rightmost element.**

In this output state, the value of `nums` has been updated to include `b` as the new rightmost element. The other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
