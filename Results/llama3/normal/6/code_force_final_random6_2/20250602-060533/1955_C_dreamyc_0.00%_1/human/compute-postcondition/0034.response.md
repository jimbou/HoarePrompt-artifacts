Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `k` is greater than 0, `nums` is a deque of at least 1 positive integers where the first element is `a`, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer equal to the minimum of `a` and `b`, `ans` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 depending on the values of `a` and `b`. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2 times the minimum of `a` and `b`, then `a` and `b` are decreased by the minimum of `a` and `b`. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the value of `nums` has been updated to include `a` as its first element. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions related to `k`, `a`, `b`, and `ans` are still valid.
