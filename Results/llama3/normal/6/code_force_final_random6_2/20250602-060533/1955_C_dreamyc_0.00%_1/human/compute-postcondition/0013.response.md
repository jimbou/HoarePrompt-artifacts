Postcondition: ***n is at least 1, k is a positive integer, nums is a deque of n-2 or n-1 positive integers. If a > 0, then nums has a as the new leftmost element. If k is greater than or equal to 2 times x, then a and b are decreased by x. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If a is 0, then ans is 1. Otherwise, ans is 0. The current value of b is greater than 0.***
