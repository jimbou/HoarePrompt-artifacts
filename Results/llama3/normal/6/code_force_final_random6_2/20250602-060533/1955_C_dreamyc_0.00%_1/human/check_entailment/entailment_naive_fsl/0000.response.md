Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to simulate the Kraken's attack on the ships. It uses a deque to efficiently remove and add ships from the front and back of the queue. The while loop continues until the Kraken's attacks are exhausted or there is only one ship left.

The program correctly handles the case where the Kraken's attacks are not enough to sink all ships, and it also correctly handles the case where the Kraken's attacks are enough to sink all ships.

The program also correctly handles the edge case where there is only one ship left, and the Kraken's attacks are enough to sink it.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
