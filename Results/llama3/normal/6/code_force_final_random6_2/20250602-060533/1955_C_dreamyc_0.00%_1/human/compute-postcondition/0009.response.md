Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `k` is a positive integer, `nums` is a deque of n-1 positive integers with `a` as the new leftmost element, `ans` is 0, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer equal to the minimum of `a` and `b`. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2 times `x`, then `a` and `b` are decreased by `x`. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The current value of `a` is greater than 0.**

In this output state, the deque `nums` has been updated by appending `a` to its left side, increasing its size by 1. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions regarding `k`, `a`, `b`, and `x` are still valid.
