Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `k` is greater than 0, `nums` is a deque of at least 0 positive integers, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer equal to the minimum of `a` and `b`, `ans` is either 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 depending on the values of `a` and `b`. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2 times the minimum of `a` and `b`, then `a` and `b` are decreased by the minimum of `a` and `b`. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, resulting in a new value that is either 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, depending on the initial values of `a` and `b`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions regarding `k`, `a`, `b`, and `x` still apply.
