Output State: **n is at least 1, k is greater than 0, nums is a deque of at least 0 positive integers, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, x is a positive integer equal to the minimum of a and b, ans is either 0, 1, or 2 depending on the values of a and b, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The break statement does not change the values of any variables, but it causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional statement it is currently inside. Therefore, the values of n, k, nums, a, b, x, and ans remain the same as before the break statement was executed. The only change is that the program breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement.
