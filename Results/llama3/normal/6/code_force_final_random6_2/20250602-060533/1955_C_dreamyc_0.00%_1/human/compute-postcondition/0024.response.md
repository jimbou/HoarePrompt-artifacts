Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `k` is greater than 0, `nums` is a deque of at least 0 positive integers, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer equal to the minimum of `a` and `b`, `ans` is either 1, 2, or 3 depending on the values of `a` and `b`. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2x, then `a` and `b` are decreased by `x`. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, and its new value depends on the initial values of `a` and `b`. All other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions related to `k`, `x`, `a`, and `b` still apply.
