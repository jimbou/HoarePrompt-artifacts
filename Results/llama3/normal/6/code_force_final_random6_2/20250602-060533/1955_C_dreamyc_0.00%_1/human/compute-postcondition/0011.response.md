Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `k` is a positive integer, `nums` is a deque of `n-2` positive integers, `ans` is 1, `a` is 0, `b` is a positive integer, `x` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. `n` is still at least 1, `k` is still a positive integer, `nums` is still a deque of `n-2` positive integers, `a` is still 0, `b` is still a positive integer, and `x` is still equal to the minimum of `a` and `b`, which is 0.
