Postcondition: **n is at least 1, k is greater than 0, nums is a deque of at least 0 positive integers, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, x is a positive integer equal to the minimum of a and b, ans is either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 depending on the values of a and b. If k is greater than or equal to 2 times the minimum of a and b, then a and b are decreased by the minimum of a and b. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
