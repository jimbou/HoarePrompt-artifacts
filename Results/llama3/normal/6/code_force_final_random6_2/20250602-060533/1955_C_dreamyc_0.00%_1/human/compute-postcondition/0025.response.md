Postcondition: ***n is at least 1, k is greater than 0, nums is a deque of at least 0 positive integers, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, x is a positive integer equal to the minimum of a and b. If a > 0 and k is greater than or equal to 2x, then a and b are decreased by x. If a > 0 and k is less than 2x, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If a is not greater than 0 and k is greater than or equal to 2x, then a and b are decreased by x. If a is not greater than 0 and k is less than 2x, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. ans is either 0, 1, 2, or 3 depending on the values of a and b.***
