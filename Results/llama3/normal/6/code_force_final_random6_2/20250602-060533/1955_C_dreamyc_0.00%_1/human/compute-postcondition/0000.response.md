Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, nums is a deque of n positive integers, ans is 0**

In this final state, the value of `n` and `k` remains unchanged as they were not modified by the code. The list `nums` is converted into a deque, which is a double-ended queue, allowing for efficient append and pop operations from both ends. The variable `ans` is initialized to 0.
