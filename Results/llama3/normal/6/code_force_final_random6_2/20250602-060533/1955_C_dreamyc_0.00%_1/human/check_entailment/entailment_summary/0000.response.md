Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly simulates the Kraken's attack on the ships and counts the number of ships that are sunk. The program uses a deque to efficiently remove and add ships from the front and back of the queue. It also correctly handles the case where there is only one ship left and the remaining attacks are sufficient to sink it.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem's requirements. The use of a deque and the while loop ensures that the program efficiently simulates the Kraken's attacks and counts the number of sunk ships.

Correctness: **True**
