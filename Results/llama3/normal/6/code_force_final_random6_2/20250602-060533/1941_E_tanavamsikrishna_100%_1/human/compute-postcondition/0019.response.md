To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(d, len(row)):`. The variables involved are `i`, `d`, and `row`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `len(row)`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `d`, and `d` is increased by at least 3.

To adjust the states, we need to increment `i` by 1, since it is the loop variable. We also need to update `d` to reflect the increase of at least 3.

The other variables, `min_heap` and `row`, are not directly involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Here is the updated state:

State: **`min_heap` is a list of tuples where the first element of each tuple is an integer from the list row and the second element is the original index of that integer in row, `min_heap` is a valid min heap, `row` is a list of non-negative integers where the first element is 1, and each subsequent element is increased by 2 from its original value except for the ith element which is increased by e[0] + 1, `d` is increased by at least 6, `i` is equal to `d + 1**
