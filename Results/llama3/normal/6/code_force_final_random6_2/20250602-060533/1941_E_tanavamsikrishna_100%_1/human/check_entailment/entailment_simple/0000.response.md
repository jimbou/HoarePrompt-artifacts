Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of minimizing the total cost of installing supports for building bridges on consecutive rows of a river grid. The program uses a combination of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, to achieve this.

`func_1` takes a row of the river grid and the maximum distance between supports as input and returns the minimum cost of installing supports for that row. It uses a min-heap data structure to keep track of the minimum cost of installing supports for each cell in the row.

`func_2` takes the number of rows, the number of columns, the number of bridges, and the maximum distance between supports as input. It reads the river grid from the input, applies `func_1` to each row to calculate the minimum cost of installing supports, and then calculates the minimum total cost of installing supports for all bridges by considering all possible combinations of consecutive rows.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. The use of a min-heap in `func_1` ensures that the minimum cost of installing supports for each cell is efficiently calculated, and the calculation of the minimum total cost in `func_2` is also correct.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
