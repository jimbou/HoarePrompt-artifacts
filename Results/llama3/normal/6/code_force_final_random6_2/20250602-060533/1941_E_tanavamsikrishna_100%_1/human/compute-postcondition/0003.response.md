To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved accordingly.

The loop head is `for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):`. This means the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range defined by `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

The length of `costs` is not explicitly stated, but it must be at least `k` elements. Since `i` is 0, the range defined by `len(costs) - (k - 1)` must be at least 1. Therefore, `len(costs)` must be at least `k`.

The other variables in the state (`n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, `rows`, and `total_costs`) are not directly involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are positive integers, `rows` is a list of lists of non-negative integers, each inner list has length `m` and represents a row in the river grid, `costs` is a list of integers that must have at least `k` elements, each integer is the result of `func_1` applied to a row in `rows` and `d`, `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs`, `i` is 1**
