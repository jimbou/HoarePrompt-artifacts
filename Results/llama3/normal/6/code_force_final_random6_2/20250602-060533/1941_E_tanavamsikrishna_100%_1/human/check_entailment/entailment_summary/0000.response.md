Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions.

Function `func_1` takes a row of the river grid and the maximum distance between supports `d` as input. It modifies the row by incrementing the first `d` elements by 2 and then iteratively updates the remaining elements based on the minimum values in a heap data structure. The function returns the last element of the modified row, which represents the minimum cost of installing supports for that row.

Function `func_2` calculates and prints the minimum sum of `k` consecutive costs in the river grid. It takes the number of rows `n`, the number of columns `m`, the number of consecutive costs to consider `k`, and the maximum distance between supports `d` as input, as well as the river grid itself. It applies `func_1` to each row in the grid to determine the minimum cost of installing supports for that row and then calculates the minimum sum of `k` consecutive costs.

The program correctly implements the problem description by:

1. Reading the input data, including the number of rows, columns, and bridges, as well as the maximum distance between supports.
2. Applying `func_1` to each row in the grid to determine the minimum cost of installing supports for that row.
3. Calculating the minimum sum of `k` consecutive costs in the grid.
4. Printing the minimum sum of `k` consecutive costs to the console.

Overall, the program correctly solves the problem of minimizing the total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive bridges in a river grid, given the constraints on the maximum distance between supports.
