Output State: **`min_heap` is a list of tuples where the first element of each tuple is an integer from the list row and the second element is the original index of that integer in row, `min_heap` is a valid min heap, the next element to be popped from `min_heap` has an index of 1, `row` is a list of non-negative integers where the first element is 1, and each subsequent element is increased by 2 from its original value except for the ith element which is increased by `e[0] + 1`, `d` is increased by at least 13, `i` is equal to `d + 2`, `e` is a list of two elements where the first element is an integer and the second element is an integer**

The code `pass` does not have any impact on the program state, so all variables remain unchanged. The `min_heap` is still a valid min heap, the next element to be popped from `min_heap` still has an index of 1, the `row` list remains the same, `d` is still increased by at least 13, `i` is still equal to `d + 2`, and `e` is still a list of two elements.
