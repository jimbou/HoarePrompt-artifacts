To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `len(costs) - (k - 1)`. For the loop to execute, `len(costs) - (k - 1)` must be at least 1.

State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are positive integers, `rows` is a list of lists of non-negative integers, each inner list has length `m` and represents a row in the river grid, `costs` is a list of integers that must have at least `k` elements, each integer is the result of `func_1` applied to a row in `rows` and `d`, `total_costs` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
