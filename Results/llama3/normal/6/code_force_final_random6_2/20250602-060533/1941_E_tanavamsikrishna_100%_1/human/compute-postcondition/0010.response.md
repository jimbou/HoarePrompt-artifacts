Functionality: **This function calculates and prints the minimum sum of k consecutive costs in a river grid, where each cost is determined by applying the func_1 function to a row in the grid and the maximum distance between supports (d). The function takes as input the number of rows (n), the number of columns (m), the number of consecutive costs to consider (k), and the maximum distance between supports (d), as well as the river grid itself, represented as a list of lists of non-negative integers. The function returns the minimum sum of k consecutive costs, which is printed to the console.**
