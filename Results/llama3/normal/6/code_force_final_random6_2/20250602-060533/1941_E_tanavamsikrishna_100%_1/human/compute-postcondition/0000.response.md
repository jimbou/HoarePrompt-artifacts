Output State: **n, m, k, and d are positive integers, rows is a list of lists of non-negative integers, each inner list has length m and represents a row in the river grid, costs is a list of integers, each integer is the result of func_1 applied to a row in rows and d, total_costs is an empty list.**

The first line of the code reads four positive integers from the input and assigns them to n, m, k, and d, respectively. The second line reads n rows of m non-negative integers from the input and stores them in the rows list. The third line applies the func_1 function to each row in rows and d, and stores the results in the costs list. The fourth line initializes an empty list called total_costs.
