Output State: **n, m, k, and d are positive integers, rows is a list of lists of non-negative integers, each inner list has length m and represents a row in the river grid, costs is a list of integers that must have at least len(costs) - (k - 1) elements, each integer is the result of func_1 applied to a row in rows and d, total_costs is a list containing the sum of all sublists of k consecutive elements of costs, i is len(costs) - (k - 1) - 1**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a state where all the variables that are not affected by the loop head and body remain unchanged. The variables in the loop head and body that are affected are `i` and `total_costs`. The value of `i` is now `len(costs) - (k - 1) - 1` because the loop iterates `len(costs) - (k - 1)` times. The value of `total_costs` is now a list containing the sum of all sublists of `k` consecutive elements of `costs`.
