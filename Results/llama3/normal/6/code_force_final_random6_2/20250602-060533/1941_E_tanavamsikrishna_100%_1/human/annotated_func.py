    #State: min_heap is a list of tuples where the first element of each tuple is an integer from the list row and the second element is the original index of that integer in row, min_heap is a valid min heap, the next element to be popped from min_heap has an index of len(row) - 1, row is a list of non-negative integers where the first element is 1, and each subsequent element is increased by 2 from its original value except for the ith element which is increased by e[0] + 1 + 1 + ... + 1 (d - 1 times), d is equal to len(row) - 1, i is equal to len(row), e is a list of two elements where the first element is an integer and the second element is an integer, min_heap contains the tuple e, min_heap contains the tuple (row[i], i).

    #The program returns the last element of the list 'row', which is a non-negative integer that has been increased by 2 from its original value except for the ith element which is increased by e[0] + 1 + 1 + ... + 1 (d - 1 times), where d is equal to len(row) - 1, i is equal to len(row), and e is a list of two elements where the first element is an integer and the second element is an integer.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of non-negative integers and an integer as input, modifies the list by incrementing the first 'd' elements by 2, and then iteratively updates the remaining elements based on the minimum values in a heap data structure. The function returns the last element of the modified list, which is a non-negative integer that has been increased by 2 from its original value, except for the last element which is increased by the sum of the minimum values in the heap plus 'd-1' times 1.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, k, and d are positive integers, rows is a list of lists of non-negative integers, each inner list has length m and represents a row in the river grid, and d is the maximum distance between supports.

    print(min(total_costs))
    #This is printed: the minimum sum of k consecutive costs (where costs are the results of func_1 applied to rows and d)

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and prints the minimum sum of k consecutive costs in a river grid, where each cost is determined by applying the func_1 function to a row in the grid and the maximum distance between supports (d). The function takes as input the number of rows (n), the number of columns (m), the number of consecutive costs to consider (k), and the maximum distance between supports (d), as well as the river grid itself, represented as a list of lists of non-negative integers. The function returns the minimum sum of k consecutive costs, which is printed to the console.
