Output State: **`min_heap` is a list of tuples where the first element of each tuple is an integer from the list `row` and the second element is the original index of that integer in `row`, `min_heap` is a valid min heap, `row` is a list of non-negative integers where the first element is 1, and each subsequent element is increased by 2 from its original value, `d` is less than `len(row)`, `i` is equal to `d`**.

The code has no impact on the program, as it is a `pass` statement, which does nothing. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.
