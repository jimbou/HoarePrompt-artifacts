Output State: **min_heap is a list of tuples where the first element of each tuple is an integer from the list row and the second element is the original index of that integer in row, min_heap is a valid min heap, the next element to be popped from min_heap has an index of len(row) - 1, row is a list of non-negative integers where the first element is 1, and each subsequent element is increased by 2 from its original value except for the ith element which is increased by e[0] + 1 + 1 + ... + 1 (d - 1 times), d is equal to len(row) - 1, i is equal to len(row), e is a list of two elements where the first element is an integer and the second element is an integer, min_heap contains the tuple e, min_heap contains the tuple (row[i], i).**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a state where the min heap contains tuples with integers from the list row and their original indices, and the heap is a valid min heap. The next element to be popped from the heap has an index equal to the last index of the list row. The list row contains non-negative integers where the first element is 1, and each subsequent element is increased by 2 from its original value, except for the ith element which is increased by the sum of e[0] and 1, repeated d - 1 times. The variable d is equal to the last index of the list row, and the variable i is equal to the length of the list row. The variable e is a list of two elements, and the min heap contains the tuple e and the tuple (row[i], i).
