Output State: **min_heap is a list of tuples where the first element of each tuple is an integer from the list row and the second element is the original index of that integer in row, min_heap is a valid min heap, the next element to be popped from min_heap has an index of d - 1 + 6, row is a list of non-negative integers where the first element is 1, and each subsequent element is increased by 2 from its original value except for the ith element which is increased by e[0] + 1 + 1, d is increased by at least 12, i is equal to d + 2, e is a list of two elements where the first element is an integer and the second element is an integer, min_heap contains the tuple e, min_heap contains the tuple (row[i], i).**

Here is the description of the output state in natural language:

The min_heap remains a valid min heap, and its structure is updated to include the tuple e and the tuple (row[i], i). The row list is modified such that the ith element is increased by e[0] + 1 + 1. The values of d, i, and e remain unchanged. The next element to be popped from min_heap still has an index of d - 1 + 6.
