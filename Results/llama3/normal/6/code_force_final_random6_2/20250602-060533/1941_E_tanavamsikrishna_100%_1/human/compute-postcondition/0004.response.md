Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are positive integers, `rows` is a list of lists of non-negative integers, each inner list has length `m` and represents a row in the river grid, `costs` is a list of integers that must have at least `k` elements, each integer is the result of `func_1` applied to a row in `rows` and `d`, `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs` and the sum of the next `k` elements of `costs`, `i` is 1**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, `rows`, and `costs` remain unchanged. The value of `total_costs` has been updated to include the sum of the next `k` elements of `costs`, starting from the index `i` (which is 1). The value of `i` remains 1.
