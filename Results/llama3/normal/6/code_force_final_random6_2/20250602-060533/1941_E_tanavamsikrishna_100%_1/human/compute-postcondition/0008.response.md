The `print(min(total_costs))` statement will print the minimum value from the `total_costs` list.

The `total_costs` list contains the sum of all sublists of `k` consecutive elements of the `costs` list. The `costs` list is a list of integers, where each integer is the result of applying the function `func_1` to a row in the `rows` list and the integer `d`.

Since the exact values of `rows`, `d`, and the function `func_1` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the elements in the `costs` list. However, based on the structure of the problem, the `total_costs` list will contain the sum of all sublists of `k` consecutive elements of the `costs` list.

The `min` function will then return the smallest value from the `total_costs` list.

Output: **the minimum sum of k consecutive costs (where costs are the results of func_1 applied to rows and d)**
