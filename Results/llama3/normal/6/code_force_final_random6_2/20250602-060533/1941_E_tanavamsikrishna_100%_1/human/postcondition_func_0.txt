This function takes a list of non-negative integers and an integer as input, modifies the list by incrementing the first 'd' elements by 2, and then iteratively updates the remaining elements based on the minimum values in a heap data structure. The function returns the last element of the modified list, which is a non-negative integer that has been increased by 2 from its original value, except for the last element which is increased by the sum of the minimum values in the heap plus 'd-1' times 1.
