To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head involves `e`, `min_heap`, `i`, and `d`. Let's analyze each variable:

1. `e`: The loop condition depends on the index of the popped element from `min_heap`, which is `e[1]`. To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the index of the next element to be popped from `min_heap`.

2. `min_heap`: Since `min_heap` is a valid min heap, the next element to be popped will have the smallest index. We need to adjust the index of the next element to be popped to satisfy the loop condition.

3. `i`: The loop condition involves `i - (d + 2)`. To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust `i` or `d` to satisfy the condition.

4. `d`: The loop condition involves `d + 2`. To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust `d` to satisfy the condition.

Based on the analysis, we need to adjust the index of the next element to be popped from `min_heap` and the value of `d` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`min_heap` is a list of tuples where the first element of each tuple is an integer from the list row and the second element is the original index of that integer in row, `min_heap` is a valid min heap, the next element to be popped from `min_heap` has an index of 1, `row` is a list of non-negative integers where the first element is 1, and each subsequent element is increased by 2 from its original value except for the ith element which is increased by `e[0] + 1`, `d` is increased by at least 13, `i` is equal to `d + 2`, `e` is a list of two elements where the first element is an integer and the second element is an integer**
