Output State: **`min_heap` is a list of tuples where the first element of each tuple is an integer from the list `row` and the second element is the original index of that integer in `row`, `min_heap` is a valid min heap, `row` is a list of non-negative integers where the first element is 1, and each subsequent element is increased by 2 from its original value, `d` is less than `len(row)` and `d` is increased by at least 1, `i` is equal to `d`**

The code `pass` does not have any impact on the program state. All variables retain their original values and properties. The min heap `min_heap` remains a valid min heap, the list `row` remains unchanged, and the variables `d` and `i` remain equal to each other, with `d` still being less than the length of `row` and increased by at least 1.
