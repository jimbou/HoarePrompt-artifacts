Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are positive integers, `rows` is a list of lists of non-negative integers, each inner list has length `m` and represents a row in the river grid, `costs` is a list of integers that must have at least `k` elements, each integer is the result of `func_1` applied to a row in `rows` and `d`, `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs`, `i` is 0**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, `rows`, and `costs` remain unchanged. The only change is that `total_costs` now contains the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs`, which is a single element in the list. The value of `i` is still 0, as it was not modified by the code.
