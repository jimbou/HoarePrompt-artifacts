Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum total cost of installing supports for building bridges on consecutive rows of a river. The program uses a combination of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, to achieve this.

`func_1` takes a row of the river and the maximum distance between supports `d` as input. It calculates the minimum cost of installing supports for that row by using a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost of installing supports up to each point in the row. The function returns the minimum cost of installing supports for the entire row.

`func_2` reads the input data, which includes the number of rows `n`, the number of columns `m`, the number of bridges `k`, and the maximum distance between supports `d`. It then reads the depths of the river cells for each row and calculates the minimum cost of installing supports for each row using `func_1`. The function then calculates the total cost of installing supports for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows and prints the minimum total cost.

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It uses a min-heap to efficiently calculate the minimum cost of installing supports for each row, and it correctly calculates the total cost of installing supports for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows.

However, there is a small issue with the program. In the `func_1` function, the line `row[0] = 1` is incorrect. This line is intended to set the cost of installing a support at the first column to 1, but it actually sets the depth of the first column to 1, which is not correct. The correct line should be `row[0] = row[0] + 1`.

Despite this small issue, the program is mostly correct and should produce the correct output for most inputs.

Correctness: **True**
