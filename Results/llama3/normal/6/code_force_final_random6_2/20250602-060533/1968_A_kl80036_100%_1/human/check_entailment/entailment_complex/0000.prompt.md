Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) â€” the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

Example

Input

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains t+1 inputs: the first input is an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) and the remaining t inputs are integers x (2 <= x <= 1000).
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        y = x - 1
        
        print(y)
        
    #State: i is an integer equal to t, x is an integer equal to the last input value, y is an integer equal to x - 1, stdin contains no input, and the value of y which is equal to x - 1 is being printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads a series of integers from standard input, where the first integer t represents the number of subsequent integers, and for each integer x, prints the value of x - 1.

# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
