To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the loop head and how its components change. The loop head is `for i in range(int(input())):`.

1. **`i`**: This is the loop variable. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have been incremented by 1. However, since we're looking at the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how `i` changes. If the loop is to execute again, `i` must be less than the number of iterations specified by `int(input())`. Since we don't know the exact value of `int(input())`, we can say `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

2. **`int(input())`**: This is the range over which the loop iterates. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than this value. Since `stdin` contains no input, we cannot directly increment `int(input())` because it's not a variable we can modify directly in this context. Instead, we consider its impact on the loop condition. If `i` is less than the value provided by `int(input())`, the loop can execute again.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `x` is an integer equal to the input value.
- `y` is an integer equal to `x - 1`.
- `stdin` contains no input.
- The value of `y` which is equal to `t` is no longer being printed, and the value of `y` which is equal to `x - 1` is being printed.

Adjusting the state for the loop to execute one more time:
- `x` remains the same since it's not directly involved in the loop condition.
- `y` remains the same for the same reason as `x`.
- `stdin` remains empty as it's a condition of the input stream, not directly modified by the loop.
- The printing of `y` values is a consequence of the loop body, not the loop head, so we don't adjust this based on the loop head alone.

However, considering the loop head's influence:
- `i` must be incremented by 1 to represent the next iteration.

State: **`x` is an integer equal to the input value, `y` is an integer equal to `x - 1`, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.

Note: The exact value of `i` cannot be determined without knowing the initial value of `i` or the value of `int(input())`, but we can say it's incremented by 1 for the next iteration.
