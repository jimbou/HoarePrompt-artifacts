Reasoning:

The problem statement asks to find any integer y (1 â‰¤ y < x) such that gcd(x, y) + y is maximum possible. The provided program simply prints x - 1 for each input x.

The key observation here is that gcd(x, x-1) is always 1, because x and x-1 are consecutive integers and therefore coprime. So, gcd(x, x-1) + (x-1) = 1 + (x-1) = x.

Since x is the maximum possible value for gcd(x, y) + y (because gcd(x, y) cannot be greater than x), the program's output x - 1 indeed maximizes the expression gcd(x, y) + y.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
