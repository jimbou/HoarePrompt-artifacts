Output State: **x is an integer equal to the input value, y is an integer equal to x - 1, stdin contains no input, and the value of y which is equal to t is no longer being printed**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been updated to the integer value provided as input, replacing its original value of `t + 1`. The value of `y` has been updated to `x - 1`, which is now equal to the input value minus 1. Since `y` was originally equal to `t`, its new value is no longer equal to `t`. The stdin remains empty, as there is no input provided. Additionally, the value of `y` which was equal to `t` is no longer being printed.
