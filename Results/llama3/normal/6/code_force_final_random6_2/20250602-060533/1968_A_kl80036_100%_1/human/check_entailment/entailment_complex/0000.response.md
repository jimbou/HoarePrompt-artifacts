Reasoning:

The problem statement asks to find any integer y (1 â‰¤ y < x) such that gcd(x, y) + y is maximum possible. The given program simply prints x - 1 for each input x.

To analyze the correctness of the program, let's consider the possible values of y for each x.

* If x is even, then x - 1 is odd, and gcd(x, x - 1) = 1. In this case, gcd(x, y) + y is maximized when y = x - 1, because gcd(x, y) = 1 and y is maximum.
* If x is odd, then x - 1 is even, and gcd(x, x - 1) = 1. In this case, gcd(x, y) + y is maximized when y = x - 1, because gcd(x, y) = 1 and y is maximum.

In both cases, the program's output x - 1 is a valid solution that maximizes gcd(x, y) + y.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
