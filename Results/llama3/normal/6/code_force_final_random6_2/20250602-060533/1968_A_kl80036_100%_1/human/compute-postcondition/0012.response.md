Output State: **i is an integer equal to t, x is an integer equal to the last input value, y is an integer equal to x - 1, stdin contains no input, and the value of y which is equal to x - 1 is being printed.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the loop counter `i` has reached the value of `t`, which is the number of input values. The variable `x` holds the last input value, and `y` is one less than this value. The input buffer is empty, and the last value of `y` is being printed.
