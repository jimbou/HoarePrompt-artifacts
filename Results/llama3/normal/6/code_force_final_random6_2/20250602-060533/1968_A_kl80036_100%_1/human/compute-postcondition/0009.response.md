Output State: **x is an integer equal to the new input value, y is an integer equal to x - 1, stdin contains no input, i is incremented by 1 from its previous value**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been updated to the new input value, and `y` has been updated to be one less than the new value of `x`. The state of `stdin` remains unchanged, as there is no input to process. The value of `i` has been incremented by 1 from its previous value, as specified in the initial state.
