Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when A = 3, B = 5, and C = 11, the program prints 3, which is incorrect. The correct output should be 15, because it is more advantageous to buy three yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5.

In the given program, the last else block is incorrect. It should calculate the total cost as (A // 2) * C + B, but it only prints A // 2 and then prints (A // 2) * C + B separately, which is not the correct output. 

Here is the correct code:

```
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
```

This corrected code will work correctly for all potential cases.
