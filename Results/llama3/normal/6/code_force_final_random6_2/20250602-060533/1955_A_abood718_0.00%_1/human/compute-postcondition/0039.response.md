The code prints the result of the expression `X * C + B`. Based on the initial state, we know that `X` is `(t-1)//2`, `B` is `t-2`, and `C` is not assigned a value.

Since `C` is not assigned a value, the expression `X * C` will result in an error, as you cannot multiply a value by an undefined variable.

Therefore, the output will be an error message indicating that `C` is not defined.

Output: **Error: C is not defined**
