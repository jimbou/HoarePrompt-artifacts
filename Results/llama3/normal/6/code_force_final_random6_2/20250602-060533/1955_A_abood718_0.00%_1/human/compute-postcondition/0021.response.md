The code prints the result of the expression `A * C / 2`, which is the product of the integers `A` and `C` divided by 2. Since `A` and `C` are integers, the result of the division is also an integer, which is obtained by truncating the decimal part of the result.

Output: **the integer part of (A * C) / 2 (where A and C are the given integers)**
