Postcondition: **A is t-1, B is t-2, C is not assigned a value, i is 2, stdin contains at least one line of input. If B * 2 is less than C, then the product of A and B which is (t-1) * (t-2) is being printed. Otherwise, if A is even, then (t-1) * C / 2 is printed. If A is odd, then (t-1)//2 is printed and (t-1)//2 * C + B is printed.**
