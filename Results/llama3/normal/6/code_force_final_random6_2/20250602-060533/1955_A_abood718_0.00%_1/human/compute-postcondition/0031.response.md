Output State: **A is t-1, B is t-2, C is not assigned a value, i is 2, stdin contains at least one line of input**

In this output state, the values of A and B are assigned the values t-1 and t-2 respectively, which are the first two integers from the input. The value of C is not assigned a value because the input only contains two integers. The value of i remains unchanged at 2. The stdin now contains at least one line of input, which is the remaining input after reading the first two integers.
