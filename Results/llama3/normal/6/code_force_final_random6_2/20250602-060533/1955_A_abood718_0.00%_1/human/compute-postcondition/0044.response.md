Functionality: **This function reads a series of input lines from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers n, a, and b, and performs calculations based on the values of a and b. If b is less than half of c, it prints the product of n and b. If n is even, it prints the product of n and c divided by 2. If n is odd, it prints the integer division of n by 2, followed by the product of the result and c, plus b. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the input variables in the state where A is 0, B and C are not assigned values, and the input stream is exhausted.**
