Postcondition: **A, B, C are integers, i is 0, stdin contains at least one line of input that contains a single integer t-1 (0 <= t-1 <= 10^4-1), and B is either less than or equal to half of C or C is 0. If A is even, the integer part of the product of A and C divided by 2 is printed. If A is odd, the value of X is printed, and the expression X * C + B is also printed.**
