Output: **This code will not print anything because it will throw an error**

Explanation: 
The code will throw an error because the variable C is not assigned a value. In the initial state, it is mentioned that C is not assigned a value. Therefore, when the code tries to execute the print statement, it will throw an error because it cannot perform arithmetic operations on an undefined variable.
