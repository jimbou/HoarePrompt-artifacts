To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for i in range(int(input())):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range of the integer input.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `stdin` contains at least one line of input that contains a single integer `t-1` (0 <= t-1 <= 10^4-1).

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and the input in `stdin` should still contain at least one line of input that contains a single integer `t-1`.

Since `i` is the only variable in the loop head, we can only adjust its value. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 1.

The state of `A`, `B`, and `C` remains unchanged, as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **A, B, C are integers, i is 1, stdin contains at least one line of input that contains a single integer t-1 (0 <= t-1 <= 10^4-1)**
