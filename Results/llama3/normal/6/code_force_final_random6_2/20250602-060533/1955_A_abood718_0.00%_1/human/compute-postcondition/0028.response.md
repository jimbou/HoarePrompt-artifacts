Postcondition: ***A, B, C are integers, i is 1, stdin contains at least one line of input that contains a single integer t-1 (0 <= t-1 <= 10^4-1). If A is even, the integer value of A * C / 2 is being printed. If A is odd, the value of A divided by 2 rounded down is being printed, and this is printed: X * C + B, where X is A divided by 2 rounded down and B and C are integers.***
