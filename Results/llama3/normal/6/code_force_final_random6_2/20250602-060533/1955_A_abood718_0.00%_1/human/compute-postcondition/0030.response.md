The only objects in the loop head are variables  i and stdin, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i and the input from stdin. If i is less than the integer value of the input from stdin, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is 1, stdin contains at least one line of input that contains a single integer t-1. So for the loop to be executed one more time i is 2 and stdin contains at least two lines of input that contains a single integer t-1 and t-2.
State: **A, B, C are integers, i is 2, stdin contains at least two lines of input that contains a single integer t-1 and t-2 (0 <= t-2 <= 10^4-2)**
