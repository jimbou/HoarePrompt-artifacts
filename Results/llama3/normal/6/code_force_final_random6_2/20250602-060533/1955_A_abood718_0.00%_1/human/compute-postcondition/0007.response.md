The code prints the integer result of the expression `A * C / 2`. 

Since A is an even number, the product of A and C will be even. Dividing this product by 2 will result in an integer. 

However, the exact value of this integer depends on the values of A and C, which are not provided in the precondition. 

Therefore, the print statement will output an integer that is half the product of A and C.

Output: **an integer that is half the product of A and C (where A is an even number and C is either less than or equal to half of C or C is 0)**
