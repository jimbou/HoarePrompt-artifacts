Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. The program correctly handles the different cases based on the values of a and b.

1. If the price of two yogurts at the regular price (2 * a) is less than the price of two yogurts at the promotion price (b), it is more advantageous to buy yogurts at the regular price. In this case, the program correctly prints the product of n and a.

2. If the number of yogurts (n) is even, it is more advantageous to buy yogurts at the promotion price. In this case, the program correctly prints the product of n and b divided by 2.

3. If the number of yogurts (n) is odd, it is more advantageous to buy one yogurt at the regular price and the rest at the promotion price. However, the program has a logical error in this case. It prints the integer division of n by 2, which is not the correct result. Instead, it should print the product of the integer division of n by 2 and b, plus a.

Correctness: **False**
