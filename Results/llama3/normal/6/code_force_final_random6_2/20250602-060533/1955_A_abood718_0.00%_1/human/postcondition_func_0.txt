This function reads a series of inputs from stdin, where each set of inputs contains three integers: n, a, and b. It then performs calculations based on the values of a and b, and prints the results. If a is less than half of b, it prints the product of n and a. If a is less than or equal to half of b, it checks if n is even. If n is even, it prints the integer division of the product of n and b by 2. If n is odd, it prints the integer part of n/2 and then prints the product of this value and b, plus a. The function continues this process until all input sets have been processed, at which point stdin is empty.
