Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts at the "Vosmiorochka" store. The program takes into account the promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles and calculates the minimum cost based on the values of a and b.

However, there is a logical error in the program. In the case where n is odd, the program prints the integer division of n by 2, followed by the product of the result and c, plus b. This is incorrect because it prints two values instead of one. The correct calculation for the minimum cost when n is odd should be (n // 2) * c + b, where // denotes integer division.

Correctness: **False**
