Output State: **A is an odd number, B is either less than or equal to half of C or C is 0, C is an integer, i is 0, X is an integer, stdin contains at least one line of input that contains a single integer t-1 (0 <= t-1 <= 10^4-1).**

In this output state, A is still an odd number, B is either less than or equal to half of C or C is 0, and C is an integer. The value of i remains 0. The new variable X is assigned the value of A divided by 2, which is an integer since A is an odd number. The stdin still contains at least one line of input that contains a single integer t-1 (0 <= t-1 <= 10^4-1).
