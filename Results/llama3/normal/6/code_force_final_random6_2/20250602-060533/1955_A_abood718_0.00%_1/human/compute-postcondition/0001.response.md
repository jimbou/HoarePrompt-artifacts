Output State: **`A`, `B`, `C` are integers, `i` is 0, stdin contains at least one line of input that contains a single integer t-1 (0 <= t-1 <= 10^4-1)**

In this output state, `A`, `B`, `C` are assigned the values of the three integers from the input, where `input().split()` accepts a line of input that contains three integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The value of `i` remains unchanged, which is 0. The stdin now contains at least one line of input that contains a single integer t-1, since one line of input has been consumed by the `input()` function.
