The code prints the result of the expression `X * C + B`. 

The value of `X` is an integer, and its value is being printed. The value of `C` is an integer, and the value of `B` is either less than or equal to half of `C` or `C` is 0.

Since the exact values of `X`, `C`, and `B` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the result of the expression `X * C + B`.

Output: **X * C + B (where X is the value of X, C is the value of C, and B is the value of B)**
