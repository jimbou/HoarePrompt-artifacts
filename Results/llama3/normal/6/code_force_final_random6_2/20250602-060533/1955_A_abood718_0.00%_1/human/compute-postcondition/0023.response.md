Output State: **A, B, C are integers, i is 1, X is an integer equal to A divided by 2 rounded down, stdin contains at least one line of input that contains a single integer t-1 (0 <= t-1 <= 10^4-1)**

In this output state, the values of A, B, C, and i remain unchanged. A new variable X is introduced, which is assigned the value of A divided by 2 rounded down (integer division). The state of the stdin also remains unchanged, still containing at least one line of input with a single integer t-1 within the specified range.
