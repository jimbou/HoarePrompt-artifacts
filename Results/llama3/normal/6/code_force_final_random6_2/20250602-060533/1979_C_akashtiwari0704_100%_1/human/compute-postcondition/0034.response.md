Postcondition: **The program processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer n and n integers k_1 to k_n. For each test case, it calculates the least common multiple of all elements in the list a and updates the sumo value accordingly. If the sumo value is greater than or equal to the product of all elements in a, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the elements of list a separated by a space. The program ensures that all variables maintain their initial properties throughout the execution, including bets being an integer between 1 and 50, a being a list of integers between 2 and 20, sumo being an integer greater than or equal to the original value plus the integer division of the least common multiple of all elements in a by the ith element of a, t being an integer between 1 and 50, and T being 0.**
