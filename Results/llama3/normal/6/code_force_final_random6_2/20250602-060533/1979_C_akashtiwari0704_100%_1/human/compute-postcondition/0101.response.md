The code prints the string `ans` which contains all elements of the updated list `a` separated by spaces. The updated list `a` is a list of integers with each element replaced by the integer division of `prod` by the previous element of `a`. `prod` is the least common multiple of all elements in the updated list `a`. 
Output: ** `bets` is greater than or equal to the length of `a`, `i` is equal to the length of `a` minus 1, `a` is a list of integers with each element replaced by the integer division of `prod` by the previous element of `a`, `prod` is the least common multiple of all elements in the updated list `a`, `sumo` is less than `prod` and is equal to the sum of the integer divisions of `prod` by each element of `a` in the original list, `ans` is a string containing all elements of `a` separated by spaces, and the string "ans" is printed which contains all elements of the updated list `a` separated by spaces**
