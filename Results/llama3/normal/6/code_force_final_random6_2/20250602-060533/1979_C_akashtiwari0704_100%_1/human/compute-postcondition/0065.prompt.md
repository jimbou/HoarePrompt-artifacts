Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `bets` is an integer between 1 and 50, `a` is a list of integers between 2 and 20, except for the ith element which is the integer division of the least common multiple of all elements in `a` by the original ith element of `a`, `sumo` is the original sumo plus the new ith element of `a`, `prod` is the least common multiple of all elements in `a`, `T` is 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50, `g` is the least common multiple of the original value of `g` and all elements of `a`, `l` is a list that must have at least `len(l)+bets-1` elements, `i` is an integer between 0 and `bets-1`, `sumo` is less than `prod`, and `ans` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(bets):
    ans += str(a[i]) + ' '


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `bets` is an integer between 1 and 50, `a` is a list of integers between 2 and 20, except for the ith element which is the integer division of the least common multiple of all elements in `a` by the original ith element of `a`, `sumo` is the original sumo plus the new ith element of `a`, `prod` is the least common multiple of all elements in `a`, `T` is 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50, `g` is the least common multiple of the original value of `g` and all elements of `a`, `l` is a list that must have at least `len(l)+bets-1` elements, `i` is 0, `sumo` is less than `prod`, `bets` must be greater than 0, and `ans` is a string that contains the string representation of the ith element of `a` followed by a space.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `bets` is an integer between 2 and 50, `a` is a list of integers between 2 and 20, except for the ith element which is the integer division of the least common multiple of all elements in `a` by the original ith element of `a`, `sumo` is the original sumo plus the new ith element of `a`, `prod` is the least common multiple of all elements in `a`, `T` is 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50, `g` is the least common multiple of the original value of `g` and all elements of `a`, `l` is a list that must have at least `len(l)+bets-1` elements, `i` is 1, `sumo` is less than `prod`, `bets` must be greater than 1, and `ans` is a string that contains the string representation of the ith element of `a` followed by a space, and then the string representation of the ith element of `a` followed by a space.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `bets` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers between 2 and 20, except for the ith element which is the integer division of the least common multiple of all elements in `a` by the original ith element of `a`, `sumo` is the original sumo plus the new ith element of `a`, `prod` is the least common multiple of all elements in `a`, `T` is 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50, `g` is the least common multiple of the original value of `g` and all elements of `a`, `l` is a list that must have at least `len(l)+bets-1` elements, `i` is 2, `sumo` is less than `prod`, `bets` must be greater than 2, and `ans` is a string that contains the string representation of the ith element of `a` followed by a space, and then the string representation of the ith element of `a` followed by a space, and then the string representation of the ith element of `a` followed by a space.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
