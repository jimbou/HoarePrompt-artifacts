Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case consists of two lines, the first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 50), the second line contains n integers k_1,k_2,...,k_n (2 <= k_i <= 20).
Code of the loop:
for T in range(t):

    def lcm(l):
        g = 1
        for i in range(len(l)):
            g = g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])
        return g
    bets = int(input())
    a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    prod = lcm(a)
    sumo = 0
    for i in range(bets):
        a[i] = prod // a[i]
        sumo += int(a[i])
    if sumo >= prod:
        print(-1)
    else:
        ans = ''
        for i in range(bets):
            ans += str(a[i]) + ' '
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The program processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer n and n integers k_1 to k_n. For each test case, it calculates the least common multiple of all elements in the list a and updates the sumo value accordingly. If the sumo value is greater than or equal to the product of all elements in a, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the elements of list a separated by a space. The program ensures that all variables maintain their initial properties throughout the execution, including bets being an integer between 1 and 50, a being a list of integers between 2 and 20, sumo being an integer greater than or equal to the original value plus the integer division of the least common multiple of all elements in a by the ith element of a, t being an integer between 1 and 50, and T being 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `bets` is an integer between 1 and 50, `a` is a list of integers between 2 and 20, except for the ith element which is the integer division of the least common multiple of all elements in `a` by the original ith element of `a`, `sumo` is the original sumo plus the new ith element of `a`, `prod` is the least common multiple of all elements in `a`, `T` is 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50, `g` is the least common multiple of the original value of `g` and all elements of `a`, `l` is a list that must have at least `len(l)+bets-1` elements, `i` is an integer between 0 and `bets-1`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, `i` is set to `bets-1`, `ans` is a string that contains the string representation of each element of `a` followed by a space, and the string representation of each element of `a` followed by a space is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `bets` is 0, `i` is `bets` - 1, `a` is a list of integers with each element replaced by the integer division of `prod` by the previous element of `a`, `prod` is the least common multiple of all elements in the updated list `a`, `sumo` is equal to the sum of the integer divisions of `prod` by each element of `a` in the original list. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, `bets` is greater than or equal to the length of `a`, `i` is equal to the length of `a` minus 1, and the string "ans" is printed which contains all elements of the updated list `a` separated by spaces.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
