Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `bets` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers between 2 and 20 (inclusive) with length equal to `bets`, where the ith element is equal to the integer division of the least common multiple of all elements in `a` by the original ith element of `a`, `sumo` is an integer greater than or equal to the original value plus the integer division of the least common multiple of all elements in `a` by the ith element of `a`, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `T` is 0, `i` is equal to `bets - 1`, `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is an empty string, and stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case consists of two lines, the first line contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 50), the second line contains `n` integers `k_1,k_2,...,k_n` (2 <= k_i <= 20).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(bets):
    ans += str(a[i]) + ' '


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `bets` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers between 2 and 20 (inclusive) with length equal to `bets`, where the ith element is equal to the integer division of the least common multiple of all elements in `a` by the original ith element of `a`, `sumo` is an integer greater than or equal to the original value plus the integer division of the least common multiple of all elements in `a` by the ith element of `a`, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `T` is 0, `i` is 0, `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is a string containing the first element of `a` followed by a space, and stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case consists of two lines, the first line contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 50), the second line contains `n` integers `k_1,k_2,...,k_n` (2 <= k_i <= 20)

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `bets` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers between 2 and 20 (inclusive) with length equal to `bets`, where the ith element is equal to the integer division of the least common multiple of all elements in `a` by the original ith element of `a`, `sumo` is an integer greater than or equal to the original value plus the integer division of the least common multiple of all elements in `a` by the ith element of `a`, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `T` is 0, `i` is 1, `ans` is a string containing the first two elements of `a` separated by a space, and stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case consists of two lines, the first line contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 50), the second line contains `n` integers `k_1,k_2,...,k_n` (2 <= k_i <= 20)

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `bets` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers between 2 and 20 (inclusive) with length equal to `bets`, where the ith element is equal to the integer division of the least common multiple of all elements in `a` by the original ith element of `a`, `sumo` is an integer greater than or equal to the original value plus the integer division of the least common multiple of all elements in `a` by the ith element of `a`, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `T` is 0, `i` is 2, `ans` is a string containing the first four elements of `a` separated by a space, and stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case consists of two lines, the first line contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 50), the second line contains `n` integers `k_1,k_2,...,k_n` (2 <= k_i <= 20)




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
