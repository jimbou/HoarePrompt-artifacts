Output State: **`bets` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers between 2 and 20 (inclusive) with length equal to `bets`, `prod` is the least common multiple of all elements in `a`, `sumo` is 0, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `T` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case consists of two lines, the first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 50), the second line contains n integers k_1,k_2,...,k_n (2 <= k_i <= 20).**

In this output state, the code has read two lines from stdin: the first line contains an integer `bets` between 1 and 50 (inclusive), and the second line contains `bets` integers between 2 and 20 (inclusive), which are stored in the list `a`. The `lcm` function calculates the least common multiple of all elements in `a` and stores it in `prod`. The variable `sumo` is initialized to 0. The values of `t` and `T` remain unchanged, and stdin still contains multiple test cases.
