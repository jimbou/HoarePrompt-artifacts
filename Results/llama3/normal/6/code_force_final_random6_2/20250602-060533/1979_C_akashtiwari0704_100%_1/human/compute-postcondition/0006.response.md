Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `T` is 0, `g` is the least common multiple of the first two elements of `l`, `l` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case consists of two lines, the first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 50), the second line contains n integers k_1,k_2,...,k_n (2 <= k_i <= 20)**

In this output state, the value of `g` has been updated to be the least common multiple of the first two elements of `l`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each with two lines of input.
