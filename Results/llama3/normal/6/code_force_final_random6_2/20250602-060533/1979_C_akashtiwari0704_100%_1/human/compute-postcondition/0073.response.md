To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `l`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than the length of `l`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `l` has at least 1 element. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `l` must have at least 2 elements.

State: **`bets` is an integer between 1 and 50, `a` is a list of integers between 2 and 20, except for the ith element which is the integer division of the least common multiple of all elements in `a` by the original ith element of `a`, `sumo` is the original sumo plus the new ith element of `a`, `prod` is the least common multiple of all elements in `a`, `T` is 2, `t` is an integer between 3 and 50, `g` is the least common multiple of `g` and `l[i]`, `l` has at least 2 elements, `i` is 1**
