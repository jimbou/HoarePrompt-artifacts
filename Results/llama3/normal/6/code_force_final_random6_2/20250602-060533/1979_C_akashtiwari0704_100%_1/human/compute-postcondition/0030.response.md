Output State: **`bets` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers between 2 and 20 (inclusive) with length equal to `bets`, where the ith element is equal to the integer division of the least common multiple of all elements in `a` by the original ith element of `a`, `sumo` is an integer greater than or equal to the original value plus the integer division of the least common multiple of all elements in `a` by the ith element of `a`, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `T` is 0, `i` is 2, `ans` is a string containing the first four elements of `a` separated by a space, and stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case consists of two lines, the first line contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 50), the second line contains `n` integers `k_1,k_2,...,k_n` (2 <= k_i <= 20)**

The code appends the string representation of the third element of `a` (since `i` is 2) to the string `ans`, separated by a space. The other variables remain unchanged.
