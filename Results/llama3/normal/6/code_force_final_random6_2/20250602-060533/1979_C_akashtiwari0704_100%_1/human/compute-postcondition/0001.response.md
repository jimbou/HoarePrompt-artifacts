According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), which ensures that the loop will execute at least once. However, to make the loop execute, `T` must be initialized to 0 (the starting value of the range function).

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `T` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case consists of two lines, the first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 50), the second line contains n integers k_1,k_2,...,k_n (2 <= k_i <= 20)**
