Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `bets` is an integer between 1 and 50, `a` is a list of integers between 2 and 20, `sumo` is an integer greater than or equal to the original value plus the integer division of the least common multiple of all elements in `a` by the ith element of `a`, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50, `T` is 1, `g` is 1
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(l)):
    g = g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `bets` is an integer between 1 and 50, `a` is a list of integers between 2 and 20, `sumo` is an integer greater than or equal to the original value plus the integer division of the least common multiple of all elements in `a` by the ith element of `a`, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50, `T` is 1, `g` is the least common multiple of the original value of `g` and the ith element of `l`, `l` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `bets` is an integer between 1 and 50, `a` is a list of integers between 2 and 20, `sumo` is an integer greater than or equal to the original value plus the integer division of the least common multiple of all elements in `a` by the ith element of `a`, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50, `T` is 1, `g` is the least common multiple of the original value of `g` and the ith element of `l`, `l` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and the value of `g` has been updated to be the least common multiple of its original value and the ith element of `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `bets` is an integer between 1 and 50, `a` is a list of integers between 2 and 20, `sumo` is an integer greater than or equal to the original value plus the integer division of the least common multiple of all elements in `a` by the ith element of `a`, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50, `T` is 1, `g` is the least common multiple of the original value of `g` and the 3rd element of `l`, `l` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
