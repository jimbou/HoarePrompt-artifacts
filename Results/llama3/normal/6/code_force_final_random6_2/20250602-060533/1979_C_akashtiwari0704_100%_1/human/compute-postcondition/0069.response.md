The only variable in the loop head is variable T, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable T and t. If T is less than t, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, T is 1, t is an integer between 1 and 50. For the loop to execute again T must be increased by 1 so T is 2 and for the loop to execute again t must be greater than 2.
State: **`bets` is an integer between 1 and 50, `a` is a list of integers between 2 and 20, except for the ith element which is the integer division of the least common multiple of all elements in `a` by the original ith element of `a`, `sumo` is the original sumo plus the new ith element of `a`, `prod` is the least common multiple of all elements in `a`, `T` is 2, `t` is an integer between 3 and 50, `g` is the least common multiple of the original value of `g` and all elements of `a`, `l` is a list that must have at least `len(l)+bets-1` elements, `i` is an integer between 0 and `bets-1`**
