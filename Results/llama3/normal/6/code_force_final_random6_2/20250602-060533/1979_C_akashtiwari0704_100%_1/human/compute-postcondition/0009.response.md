Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `T` is 0, `g` is the least common multiple of all elements in `l`, `l` is a list that must have at least `len(l)` elements, `i` is `len(l) - 1`, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case consists of two lines, the first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 50), the second line contains n integers k_1,k_2,...,k_n (2 <= k_i <= 20)**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `g` will be the least common multiple of all the elements in the list `l`. The loop will have iterated over all elements in `l`, and the index `i` will be pointing to the last element in `l`. The other variables `t`, `T`, and the contents of `stdin` remain unchanged.
