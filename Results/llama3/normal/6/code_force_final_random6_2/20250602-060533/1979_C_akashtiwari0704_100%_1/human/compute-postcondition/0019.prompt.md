Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `bets` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers between 2 and 20 (inclusive) with length equal to `bets`, `prod` is the least common multiple of all elements in `a`, `sumo` is 0, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `T` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case consists of two lines, the first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 50), the second line contains n integers k_1,k_2,...,k_n (2 <= k_i <= 20).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(bets):
    a[i] = prod // a[i]
    sumo += int(a[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: bets is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), a is a list of integers between 2 and 20 (inclusive) with length equal to bets, prod is the least common multiple of all elements in a, sumo is an integer greater than or equal to 0, t is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), T is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case consists of two lines, the first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 50), the second line contains n integers k_1,k_2,...,k_n (2 <= k_i <= 20), i is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: bets is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), a is a list of integers between 2 and 20 (inclusive) with length equal to bets, prod is the least common multiple of all elements in a, sumo is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and is equal to its original value plus the integer division of prod by the ith element of a, t is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), T is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case consists of two lines, the first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 50), the second line contains n integers k_1,k_2,...,k_n (2 <= k_i <= 20), i is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: bets is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), a is a list of integers between 2 and 20 (inclusive) with length equal to bets, where the ith element is equal to the integer division of the least common multiple of all elements in a by the original ith element of a, sumo is an integer greater than or equal to the original value plus the integer division of the least common multiple of all elements in a by the ith element of a, t is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), T is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case consists of two lines, the first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 50), the second line contains n integers k_1,k_2,...,k_n (2 <= k_i <= 20), i is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
