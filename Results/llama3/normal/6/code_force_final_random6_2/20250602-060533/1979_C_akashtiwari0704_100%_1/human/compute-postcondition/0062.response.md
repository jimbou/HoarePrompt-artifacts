Output State: **`bets` is an integer between 2 and 50, `a` is a list of integers between 2 and 20, except for the ith element which is the integer division of the least common multiple of all elements in `a` by the original ith element of `a`, `sumo` is the original sumo plus the new ith element of `a`, `prod` is the least common multiple of all elements in `a`, `T` is 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50, `g` is the least common multiple of the original value of `g` and all elements of `a`, `l` is a list that must have at least `len(l)+bets-1` elements, `i` is 1, `sumo` is less than `prod`, `bets` must be greater than 1, and `ans` is a string that contains the string representation of the ith element of `a` followed by a space, and then the string representation of the ith element of `a` followed by a space.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the string `ans` now contains the string representation of the ith element of `a` followed by a space, twice.
