Output State: **`bets` is an integer between 1 and 50, `a` is a list of integers between 2 and 20, except for the ith element which is the integer division of the least common multiple of all elements in `a` by the original ith element of `a`, `sumo` is the original sumo plus the new ith element of `a`, `prod` is the least common multiple of all elements in `a`, `T` is 2, `t` is an integer between 3 and 50, `g` is the least common multiple of `g` and `l[i]`, `l` has at least 1 element, `i` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `g` has been updated to be the least common multiple of its original value and `l[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
