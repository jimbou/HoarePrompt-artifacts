Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `T` is 0, `g` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case consists of two lines, the first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 50), the second line contains n integers k_1,k_2,...,k_n (2 <= k_i <= 20)
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(l)):
    g = g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `T` is 0, `g` is the least common multiple of the first element of `l` and the previous value of `g`, `l` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case consists of two lines, the first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 50), the second line contains n integers k_1,k_2,...,k_n (2 <= k_i <= 20)

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `T` is 0, `g` is the least common multiple of the first two elements of `l`, `l` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case consists of two lines, the first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 50), the second line contains n integers k_1,k_2,...,k_n (2 <= k_i <= 20)

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `T` is 0, `g` is the least common multiple of the first three elements of `l`, `l` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case consists of two lines, the first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 50), the second line contains n integers k_1,k_2,...,k_n (2 <= k_i <= 20)




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
