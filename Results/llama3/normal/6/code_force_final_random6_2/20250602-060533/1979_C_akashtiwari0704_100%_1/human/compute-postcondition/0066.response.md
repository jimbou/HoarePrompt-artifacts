The code prints a string containing the string representation of each element of the list `a` followed by a space.
Since the exact elements of the list `a` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the elements. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output a string containing the string representation of each element of `a` followed by a space.
Output: **string representation of each element of the list a followed by a space**
