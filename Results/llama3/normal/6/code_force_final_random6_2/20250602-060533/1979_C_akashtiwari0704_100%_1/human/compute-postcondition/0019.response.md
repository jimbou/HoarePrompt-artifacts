Output State: **bets is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), a is a list of integers between 2 and 20 (inclusive) with length equal to bets, where the ith element is equal to the integer division of the least common multiple of all elements in a by the original ith element of a, sumo is an integer greater than or equal to the original value plus the integer division of the least common multiple of all elements in a by the ith element of a, t is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), T is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case consists of two lines, the first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 50), the second line contains n integers k_1,k_2,...,k_n (2 <= k_i <= 20), i is equal to bets - 1.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `bets` remains an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers between 2 and 20 (inclusive) with length equal to `bets`, where each element is the integer division of the least common multiple of all elements in `a` by the original element, `sumo` is an integer greater than or equal to the original value plus the integer division of the least common multiple of all elements in `a` by the ith element of `a`, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `T` is 0, and `i` is equal to `bets - 1`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
