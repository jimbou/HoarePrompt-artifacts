Output State: **`bets` is an integer between 1 and 50, `a` is a list of integers between 2 and 20, except for the ith element which is the integer division of the least common multiple of all elements in `a` by the original ith element of `a`, `sumo` is the original sumo plus the new ith element of `a`, `prod` is the least common multiple of all elements in `a`, `T` is 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50, `g` is the least common multiple of the original value of `g` and all elements of `a`, `l` is a list that must have at least `len(l)+bets-1` elements, `i` is an integer between 0 and `bets-1`, `sumo` is less than `prod`, and `ans` is an empty string.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `ans` which is an empty string. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.
