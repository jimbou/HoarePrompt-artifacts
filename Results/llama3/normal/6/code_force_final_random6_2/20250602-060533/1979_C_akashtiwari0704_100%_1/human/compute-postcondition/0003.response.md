The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `l`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `l`. If `l` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `T` is 0, `g` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case consists of two lines, the first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 50), the second line contains n integers k_1,k_2,...,k_n (2 <= k_i <= 20). So for the loop to be executed  the list `l` must have at least 1 element and `i` is 0.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `T` is 0, `g` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case consists of two lines, the first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 50), the second line contains n integers k_1,k_2,...,k_n (2 <= k_i <= 20), `l` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0**
