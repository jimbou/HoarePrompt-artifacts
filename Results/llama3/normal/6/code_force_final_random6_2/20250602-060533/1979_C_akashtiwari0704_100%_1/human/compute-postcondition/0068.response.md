Postcondition: **`bets` is an integer between 1 and 50, `a` is a list of integers between 2 and 20, except for the ith element which is the integer division of the least common multiple of all elements in `a` by the original ith element of `a`, `sumo` is the original sumo plus the new ith element of `a`, `prod` is the least common multiple of all elements in `a`, `T` is 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50, `g` is the least common multiple of the original value of `g` and all elements of `a`, `l` is a list that must have at least `len(l)+bets-1` elements, `i` is an integer between 0 and `bets-1`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, `i` is set to `bets-1`, `ans` is a string that contains the string representation of each element of `a` followed by a space, and the string representation of each element of `a` followed by a space is being printed.**
