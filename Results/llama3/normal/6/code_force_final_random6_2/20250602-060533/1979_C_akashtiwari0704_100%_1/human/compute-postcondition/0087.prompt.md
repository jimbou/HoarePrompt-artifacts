Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: bets is an integer between 1 and 50, a is a list of integers, prod is the least common multiple of all elements in a, sumo is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(bets):
    a[i] = prod // a[i]
    sumo += int(a[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: bets is an integer greater than 0, i is 0, a is a list of integers with the first element replaced by the integer division of prod by the original first element of a, prod is the least common multiple of all elements in the updated list a, sumo is equal to the integer division of prod by the original first element of a

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: bets is an integer greater than 1, i is 1, a is a list of integers with the second element replaced by the integer division of prod by the original second element of a, prod is the least common multiple of all elements in the updated list a, sumo is equal to the integer division of prod by the original first element of a plus the integer division of prod by the original second element of a

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: bets is an integer greater than 2, i is 2, a is a list of integers with the second element replaced by the integer division of prod by the original second element of a and the third element replaced by the integer division of prod by the updated second element of a, prod is the least common multiple of all elements in the updated list a, sumo is equal to the integer division of prod by the original first element of a plus the integer division of prod by the original second element of a plus the integer division of prod by the updated second element of a




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
