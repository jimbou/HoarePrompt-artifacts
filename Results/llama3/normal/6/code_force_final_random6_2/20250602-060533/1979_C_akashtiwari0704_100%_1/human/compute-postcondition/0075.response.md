The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and l, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `l`. If `i` is less than `len(l)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `l` has at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `l` must have at least 3 elements.
State: **`bets` is an integer between 1 and 50, `a` is a list of integers between 2 and 20, except for the ith element which is the integer division of the least common multiple of all elements in `a` by the original ith element of `a`, `sumo` is the original sumo plus the new ith element of `a`, `prod` is the least common multiple of all elements in `a`, `T` is 2, `t` is an integer between 3 and 50, `g` is the least common multiple of `g` and `l[1]`, `l` has at least 3 elements, `i` is 2**
