Postcondition: **`bets` is 0, `i` is `bets` - 1, `a` is a list of integers with each element replaced by the integer division of `prod` by the previous element of `a`, `prod` is the least common multiple of all elements in the updated list `a`, `sumo` is equal to the sum of the integer divisions of `prod` by each element of `a` in the original list. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, `bets` is greater than or equal to the length of `a`, `i` is equal to the length of `a` minus 1, and the string "ans" is printed which contains all elements of the updated list `a` separated by spaces.**
