Output State: **`bets` is an integer between 1 and 50, `a` is a list of integers between 2 and 20, except for the ith element which is the integer division of the least common multiple of all elements in `a` by the original ith element of `a`, `sumo` is the original sumo plus the new ith element of `a`, `prod` is the least common multiple of all elements in `a`, `T` is 2, `t` is an integer between 3 and 50, `g` is 1, `l` is a list that must have at least `len(l)+bets-1` elements, `i` is an integer between 0 and `bets-1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `g` has been reset to 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` still contains integers between 2 and 20, except for the ith element which is the integer division of the least common multiple of all elements in `a` by the original ith element of `a`. The sum `sumo` is still the original sumo plus the new ith element of `a`, and the product `prod` is still the least common multiple of all elements in `a`. The values of `bets`, `T`, `t`, and `i` are also unchanged. The list `l` still has at least `len(l)+bets-1` elements.
