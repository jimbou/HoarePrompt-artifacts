Output State: **`bets` is an integer between 1 and 50, `a` is a list of integers between 2 and 20, except for the ith element which is the integer division of the least common multiple of all elements in `a` by the original ith element of `a`, `sumo` is the original sumo plus the new ith element of `a`, `prod` is the least common multiple of all elements in `a`, `T` is 2, `t` is an integer between 3 and 50, `g` is the least common multiple of `g`, `l[1]`, and `l[2]`, `l` has at least 3 elements, `i` is 2**.

In this output state, the value of `g` has been updated to be the least common multiple of `g`, `l[1]`, and `l[2]`, as `i` is 2 and `l[i]` refers to the third element of `l`. The other variables remain unchanged.
