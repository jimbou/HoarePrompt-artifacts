The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and bets, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `bets`. If `i` is less than `bets`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is an integer between 0 and `bets-1`, `bets` is an integer between 1 and 50. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `bets` must be greater than the new value of `i`. So, `i` is an integer between 1 and `bets-1` and `bets` is an integer between 2 and 50.
State: **bets is an integer between 2 and 50, a is a list of integers between 2 and 20, except for the ith element which is the integer division of prod by the original ith element of a, sumo is the original sumo plus the new ith element of a, prod is the least common multiple of all elements in a, T is 1, t is an integer between 1 and 50, g is the least common multiple of the original value of g and all elements of a, l is a list that must have at least len(l) elements, i is an integer between 1 and bets-1**
