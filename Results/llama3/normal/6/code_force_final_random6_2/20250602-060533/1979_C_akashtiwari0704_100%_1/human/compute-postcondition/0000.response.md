The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. Since stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case consists of two lines, the first line contains an integer n, and the second line contains n integers, the first input is an integer n. Therefore, `t` is assigned the value of the first integer n.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case consists of two lines, the first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 50), the second line contains n integers k_1,k_2,...,k_n (2 <= k_i <= 20).**
