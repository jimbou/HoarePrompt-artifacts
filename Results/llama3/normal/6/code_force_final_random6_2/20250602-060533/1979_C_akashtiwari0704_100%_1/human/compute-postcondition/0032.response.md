The code prints a string containing all elements of the list `a` separated by a space.
The list `a` is defined such that its ith element is equal to the integer division of the least common multiple of all elements in `a` by the original ith element of `a`. 
Since the exact elements of the list `a` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the elements in `a`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output a string containing all elements of the list `a` separated by a space.
Output: **a string containing all elements of the list `a` separated by a space (where a is the list of integers between 2 and 20 inclusive with length equal to `bets`)**
