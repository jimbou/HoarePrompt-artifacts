Output State: **`bets` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers between 2 and 20 (inclusive) with length equal to `bets`, where the ith element is equal to the integer division of the least common multiple of all elements in `a` by the original ith element of `a`, `sumo` is an integer greater than or equal to the original value plus the integer division of the least common multiple of all elements in `a` by the ith element of `a`, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `T` is 0, `i` is equal to `bets - 1`, `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is an empty string, and stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case consists of two lines, the first line contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 50), the second line contains `n` integers `k_1,k_2,...,k_n` (2 <= k_i <= 20).**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been changed to an empty string, while all other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines, with the first line containing an integer `n` and the second line containing `n` integers.
