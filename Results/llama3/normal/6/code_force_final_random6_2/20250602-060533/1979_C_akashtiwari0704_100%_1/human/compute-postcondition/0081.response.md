The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and bets, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `bets`. If bets is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, bets is an integer between 1 and 50 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `bets` is greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **`bets` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `prod` is the least common multiple of all elements in `a`, `sumo` is 0**
