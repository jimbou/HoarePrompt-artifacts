Output State: **The loop has finished executing, and the program has processed all test cases. The values of `bets`, `a`, `prod`, `sumo`, `T`, `t`, `g`, `l`, `i`, and `ans` have been updated accordingly. The program has printed the results for each test case, either -1 if the sum of the integer divisions of the least common multiple by each element is greater than or equal to the least common multiple, or the updated list of elements separated by spaces. The program has maintained the initial properties of all variables throughout the execution.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations means that the program has finished processing all test cases, and the variables have been updated according to the loop's logic. The program has printed the results for each test case, and the initial properties of all variables have been maintained throughout the execution.
