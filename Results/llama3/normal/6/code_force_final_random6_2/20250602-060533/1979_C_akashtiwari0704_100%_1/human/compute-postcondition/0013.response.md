To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `bets`. The loop will execute if `bets` is at least 1. Since `bets` is already defined as an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), we can conclude that `bets` is indeed at least 1. Therefore, we only need to adjust the state of `i` to be 0, which is the starting value of the range.

State: **`bets` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers between 2 and 20 (inclusive) with length equal to `bets`, `prod` is the least common multiple of all elements in `a`, `sumo` is 0, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `T` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case consists of two lines, the first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 50), the second line contains n integers k_1,k_2,...,k_n (2 <= k_i <= 20), `i` is 0**
