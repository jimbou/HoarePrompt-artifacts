The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and bets, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `bets`. If `i` is less than `bets`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `bets` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `bets` must be greater than 2.
State: **`bets` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), a is a list of integers between 2 and 20 (inclusive) with length equal to bets, prod is the least common multiple of all elements in a, sumo is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and is equal to its original value plus the integer division of prod by the ith element of a, t is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), T is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case consists of two lines, the first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 50), the second line contains n integers k_1,k_2,...,k_n (2 <= k_i <= 20), i is 2**
