The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and list l, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i and list l. If i is less than the length of list l, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is 0, list l has at least 1 element. For the loop to execute again i is increased by 1 so i is 1 and for the loop to execute again list l must have at least 2 elements.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `T` is 0, `g` is the least common multiple of the first element of `l` and the previous value of `g`, `l` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case consists of two lines, the first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 50), the second line contains n integers k_1,k_2,...,k_n (2 <= k_i <= 20)**
