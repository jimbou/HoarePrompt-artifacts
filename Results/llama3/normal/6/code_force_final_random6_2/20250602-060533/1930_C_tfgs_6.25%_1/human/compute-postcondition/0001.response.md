The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer and `a` is a list of `n` integers, but this does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**
