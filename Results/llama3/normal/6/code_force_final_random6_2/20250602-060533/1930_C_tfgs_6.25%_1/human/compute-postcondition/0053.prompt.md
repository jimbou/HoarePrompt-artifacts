Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is an empty list, counter is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in the original list a, cnt is 0, ans is a list containing all the integers from the original list a in descending order, with the integers a[i - 1] - j - 1 for j ranging from 0 to adv - 1 inserted between each pair of adjacent integers a[i - 1] and a[i] if a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1 is greater than 0, and counter[a[i]] is 0 for all i.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(cnt):
    ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an empty list, `counter` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in the original list `a`, `cnt` must be greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing all the integers from the original list `a` in descending order, with the integers `a[i - 1] - j - 1` for `j` ranging from 0 to `adv - 1` inserted between each pair of adjacent integers `a[i - 1]` and `a[i]` if `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1` is greater than 0, and `counter[a[i]]` is 0 for all `i`, and the last element of `ans` is decreased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an empty list, `counter` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in the original list `a`, `cnt` is greater than 0, `cnt` is decreased by 1, `ans` is a list containing all the integers from the original list `a` in descending order, with the integers `a[i - 1] - j - 1` for `j` ranging from 0 to `adv - 1` inserted between each pair of adjacent integers `a[i - 1]` and `a[i]` if `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1` is greater than 0, and `counter[a[i]]` is 0 for all `i`, and the last element of `ans` is decreased by 2

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an empty list, `counter` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in the original list `a`, `cnt` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing all the integers from the original list `a` in descending order, with the integers `a[i - 1] - j - 1` for `j` ranging from 0 to `adv - 1` inserted between each pair of adjacent integers `a[i - 1]` and `a[i]` if `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1` is greater than 0, and `counter[a[i]]` is 0 for all `i`, and the last element of `ans` is decreased by 3




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
