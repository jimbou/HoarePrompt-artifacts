This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a single integer n followed by n integers. It modifies the integers by adding their 1-based index to each, removes duplicates, sorts them in descending order, and inserts additional integers between each pair of adjacent integers if their difference is greater than 1. The function then prints the resulting list of integers, with the last element decreased by the number of remaining integers.
