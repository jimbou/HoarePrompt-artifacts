#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines of input. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3*10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_{n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3*10^5.
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] += i + 1
        
    #State: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `i` is increased by `i + 1`, `i` is `n - 1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one
    counter = Counter(a)
    a = list(set(a))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    cnt = n - len(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i > 0:
            adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, counter[a[i - 1]])
            for j in range(adv):
                ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
            cnt -= adv
            counter[a[i - 1]] -= adv
        
        ans.append(a[i])
        
        counter[a[i]] -= 1
        
    #State: n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is an empty list, counter is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in the original list a, cnt is 0, ans is a list containing all the integers from the original list a in descending order, with the integers a[i - 1] - j - 1 for j ranging from 0 to adv - 1 inserted between each pair of adjacent integers a[i - 1] and a[i] if a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1 is greater than 0, and counter[a[i]] is 0 for all i.
    for _ in range(cnt):
        ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
        
    #State: n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is an empty list, counter is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in the original list a, cnt is 0, ans is a list containing all the integers from the original list a in descending order, with the integers a[i - 1] - j - 1 for j ranging from 0 to adv - 1 inserted between each pair of adjacent integers a[i - 1] and a[i] if a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1 is greater than 0, and counter[a[i]] is 0 for all i, and the last element of ans is decreased by cnt.
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: all the integers from the original list a in descending order, with the integers a[i - 1] - j - 1 for j ranging from 0 to adv - 1 inserted between each pair of adjacent integers a[i - 1] and a[i] if a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1 is greater than 0, and the last element of ans is decreased by cnt

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a single integer n followed by n integers. It modifies the integers by adding their 1-based index to each, removes duplicates, sorts them in descending order, and inserts additional integers between each pair of adjacent integers if their difference is greater than 1. The function then prints the resulting list of integers, with the last element decreased by the number of remaining integers.
