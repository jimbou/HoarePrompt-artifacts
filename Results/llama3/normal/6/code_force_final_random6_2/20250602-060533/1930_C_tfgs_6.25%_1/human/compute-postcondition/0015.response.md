Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order that must have at least 1 integer, `counter` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in the original list `a`, `cnt` is the number of duplicate integers in the original list `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value `a[i - 1] - j - 1` and `a[i - 1] - 1 - 1`, `i` is greater than 0, `adv` is greater than 1, and `j` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by appending the value `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, which is equivalent to `a[i - 1] - 1 - 1` since `j` is 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
