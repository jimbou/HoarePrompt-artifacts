Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The program first reads the input, modifies the integers by adding their 1-based index, removes duplicates, and sorts them in descending order. Then, it inserts additional integers between each pair of adjacent integers if their difference is greater than 1. Finally, it prints the resulting list of integers, with the last element decreased by the number of remaining integers.

The program uses a Counter to keep track of the count of each integer in the list, and it uses this count to determine how many additional integers to insert between each pair of adjacent integers. The program also uses a variable `cnt` to keep track of the number of remaining integers that need to be inserted.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the lexicographically largest `b` that Stack can make.

Correctness: **True**
