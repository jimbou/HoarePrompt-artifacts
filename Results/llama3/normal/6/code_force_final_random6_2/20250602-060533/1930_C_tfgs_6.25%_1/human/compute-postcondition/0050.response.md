Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an empty list, `counter` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in the original list `a`, `cnt` is greater than 0, `cnt` is decreased by 1, `ans` is a list containing all the integers from the original list `a` in descending order, with the integers `a[i - 1] - j - 1` for `j` ranging from 0 to `adv - 1` inserted between each pair of adjacent integers `a[i - 1]` and `a[i]` if `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1` is greater than 0, and `counter[a[i]]` is 0 for all `i`, and the last element of `ans` is decreased by 2**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains the same, `a` is still an empty list, `counter` still contains the frequency of each integer in the original list `a`, `cnt` is still greater than 0 but decreased by 1, and `ans` is still a list containing all the integers from the original list `a` in descending order with the specified inserted integers, but the last element of `ans` has been decreased by 1 again, making it 2 less than its original value.
