Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order that must have at least 1 integer, `counter` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in the original list `a`, `cnt` is the number of duplicate integers in the original list `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, `a[i - 1] - 1 - 1`, and `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, `i` is greater than 0, `adv` is greater than 2, and `j` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to include an additional element, which is `a[i - 1] - j - 1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The list `ans` now contains three elements: `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, `a[i - 1] - 1 - 1`, and `a[i - 1] - j - 1`.
