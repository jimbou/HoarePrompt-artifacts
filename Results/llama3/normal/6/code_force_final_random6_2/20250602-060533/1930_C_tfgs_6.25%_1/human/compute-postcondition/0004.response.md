Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is increased by 1 and the second element is increased by 3, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**

In this output state, the value of `a[i]` has been updated by adding `i + 1` to it. Since `i` is 1, the second element of the list `a` (at index 1) has been increased by 3 (1 + 1 + 1). The other variables remain unchanged.
