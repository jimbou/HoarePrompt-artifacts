Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order that must have at least 1 integer, `counter` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in the original list `a`, `cnt` is the number of duplicate integers in the original list `a`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is greater than 0, and `adv` is the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `counter[a[i - 1]]`.**

In this output state, the value of `adv` is calculated based on the current values of `a`, `i`, `cnt`, and `counter`. The value of `adv` is the minimum of three values: the difference between the `i-1`th and `i`th elements of `a` minus 1, the number of duplicate integers in the original list `a`, and the frequency of the `i-1`th element of `a` in the original list. The other variables remain unchanged.
