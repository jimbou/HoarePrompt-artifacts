Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is an empty list, counter is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in the original list a, cnt is 0, ans is a list containing all the integers from the original list a in descending order, with the integers a[i - 1] - j - 1 for j ranging from 0 to adv - 1 inserted between each pair of adjacent integers a[i - 1] and a[i] if a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1 is greater than 0, and counter[a[i]] is 0 for all i, and the last element of ans is decreased by cnt.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except that the last element of ans is decreased by cnt. This is because the loop decrements the last element of ans by 1 in each iteration, and the number of iterations is equal to cnt.
