Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order, counter is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in the original list a, cnt is the number of duplicate integers in the original list a, ans is an empty list, i is n - 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if i > 0:
        adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, counter[a[i - 1]])
        for j in range(adv):
            ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
        cnt -= adv
        counter[a[i - 1]] -= adv
    ans.append(a[i])
    counter[a[i]] -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order that must have at least 1 integer, counter is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in the original list a, cnt is the number of duplicate integers in the original list a, ans is a list containing the values a[i - 1] - j - 1 for j ranging from 0 to adv - 1 if i is greater than 0, otherwise ans is an empty list, i is greater than or equal to 0, and counter[a[i - 1]] is the frequency of a[i - 1] minus adv if i is greater than 0, ans also contains the value a[i], and counter[a[i]] is one less than its original value.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order that must have at least 2 integers, counter is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in the original list a, cnt is the number of duplicate integers in the original list a, ans is a list containing the values a[i - 1] - j - 1 for j ranging from 0 to adv - 1 if i is greater than 0, otherwise ans is an empty list, i is greater than or equal to 1, and counter[a[i - 1]] is the frequency of a[i - 1] minus adv if i is greater than 0, ans also contains the value a[i], and counter[a[i]] is one less than its original value. If i > 0, then adv is the minimum of a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, and counter[a[i - 1]], ans now contains the value a[i - 1] - adv - 1, and counter[a[i - 1]] is adv less than its original value, and j is adv. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order that must have at least 2 integers, counter is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in the original list a, cnt is the number of duplicate integers in the original list a minus adv if i is greater than 0, otherwise cnt remains unchanged, ans is a list containing the values a[i - 1] - j - 1 for j ranging from 0 to adv - 1 if i is greater than 0, otherwise ans is an empty list, i is greater than or equal to 2, and counter[a[i - 1]] is the frequency of a[i - 1] minus adv if i is greater than 0, ans also contains the value a[i], and counter[a[i]] is one less than its original value. If i > 0, then adv is equal to counter[a[i - 1]], ans now contains the value a[i - 1] - adv - 1, and counter[a[i - 1]] is adv less than its original value, and j is adv - 1, and ans now contains the value a[i - 1] - j - 1 which is a[i - 1] - adv.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
