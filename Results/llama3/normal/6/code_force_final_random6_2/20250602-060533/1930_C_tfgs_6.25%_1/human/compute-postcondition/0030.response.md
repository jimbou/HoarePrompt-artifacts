Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order that must have at least 2 integers, `counter` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in the original list `a`, `cnt` is the number of duplicate integers in the original list `a`, `ans` is a list containing the values `a[i - 1] - j - 1` for `j` ranging from 0 to `adv - 1` if `i` is greater than 0, otherwise `ans` is an empty list, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `adv` is the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `counter[a[i - 1]]`, `ans` also contains the value `a[i]`, and `counter[a[i]]` is one less than its original value, `adv` must be greater than or equal to 0, `j` is `adv`, and `ans` now contains the value `a[i - 1] - adv - 1`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `ans` will contain all the values `a[i - 1] - j - 1` for `j` ranging from 0 to `adv - 1`, and the value `a[i]`. The variable `j` will be equal to `adv`, and `adv` will be the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `counter[a[i - 1]]`. The other variables `n`, `a`, `counter`, `cnt`, and `i` will remain unchanged.
