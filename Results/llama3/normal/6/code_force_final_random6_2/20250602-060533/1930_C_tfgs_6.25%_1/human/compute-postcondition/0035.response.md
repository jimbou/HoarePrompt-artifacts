Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order that must have at least 2 integers, `counter` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in the original list `a`, `cnt` is the number of duplicate integers in the original list `a`, `ans` is a list containing the values `a[i - 1] - j - 1` for `j` ranging from 0 to `adv - 1` if `i` is greater than 0, otherwise `ans` is an empty list, `i` is greater than or equal to 2, and `counter[a[i - 1]]` is the frequency of `a[i - 1]` minus `adv` if `i` is greater than 0, `ans` also contains the value `a[i]`, and `counter[a[i]]` is one less than its original value. If `i > 0`, then `adv` is the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `counter[a[i - 1]]`, `ans` now contains the value `a[i - 1] - adv - 1`, and `counter[a[i - 1]]` is `adv` less than its original value, and `j` is `adv`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the variable `adv` has been updated to be the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `counter[a[i - 1]]`. This means that `adv` now holds the smallest value among these three options. The rest of the variables remain unchanged, and their values are still as described in the initial state.
