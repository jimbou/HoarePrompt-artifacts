Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is an empty list, counter is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in the original list a, cnt is 0, ans is a list containing all the integers from the original list a in descending order, with the integers a[i - 1] - j - 1 for j ranging from 0 to adv - 1 inserted between each pair of adjacent integers a[i - 1] and a[i] if a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1 is greater than 0, and counter[a[i]] is 0 for all i.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `a` is empty, the counter dictionary still contains the frequency of each integer in the original list `a`, the count of duplicate integers `cnt` is 0, and the answer list `ans` contains all the integers from the original list `a` in descending order, with the integers `a[i - 1] - j - 1` for `j` ranging from 0 to `adv - 1` inserted between each pair of adjacent integers `a[i - 1]` and `a[i]` if `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1` is greater than 0. The frequency of each integer in the counter dictionary is 0.
