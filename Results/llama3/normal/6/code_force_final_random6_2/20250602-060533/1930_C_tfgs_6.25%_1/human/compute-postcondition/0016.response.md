To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for j in range(adv):`.

From the given state at the end of the previous iteration, we know that `j` is 1 and `adv` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, and `adv` must still be greater than the new value of `j`.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `j` is 2 (incremented by 1)
* `adv` is greater than 2 (since `j` is now 2)

The other variables (`n`, `a`, `counter`, `cnt`, `ans`, and `i`) are not affected by the loop head and remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order that must have at least 1 integer, `counter` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in the original list `a`, `cnt` is the number of duplicate integers in the original list `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value `a[i - 1] - j - 1` and `a[i - 1] - 1 - 1`, `i` is greater than 0, `adv` is greater than 2, and `j` is 2**
