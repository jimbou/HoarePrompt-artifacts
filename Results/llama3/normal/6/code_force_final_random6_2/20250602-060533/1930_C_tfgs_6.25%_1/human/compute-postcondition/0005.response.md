The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 2 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is increased by 1 and the second element is increased by 3, `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**
