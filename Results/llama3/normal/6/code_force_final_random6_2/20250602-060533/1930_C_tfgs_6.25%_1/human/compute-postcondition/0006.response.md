The value of `a[i]` is increased by `i + 1`, where `i` is 2. So, `a[i]` is increased by 3. The first element of `a` is increased by 1 and the second element is increased by 3. The third element of `a` is increased by 3. The values of the other variables are not affected. stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is increased by 1, the second element is increased by 3, and the third element is increased by 3, `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**
