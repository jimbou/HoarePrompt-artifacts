To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `adv`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `adv`. If `adv` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the state of the variables does not ensure that the loop will execute, so we need to adjust the state of `adv` to be at least 1 and `j` to be 0.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order that must have at least 2 integers, `counter` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in the original list `a`, `cnt` is the number of duplicate integers in the original list `a`, `ans` is a list containing the values `a[i - 1] - j - 1` for `j` ranging from 0 to `adv - 1` if `i` is greater than 0, otherwise `ans` is an empty list, `i` is greater than or equal to 2, and `counter[a[i - 1]]` is the frequency of `a[i - 1]` minus `adv` if `i` is greater than 0, `ans` also contains the value `a[i]`, and `counter[a[i]]` is one less than its original value. If `i > 0`, then `adv` is at least 1, `ans` now contains the value `a[i - 1] - adv - 1`, and `counter[a[i - 1]]` is `adv` less than its original value, and `j` is 0.**
