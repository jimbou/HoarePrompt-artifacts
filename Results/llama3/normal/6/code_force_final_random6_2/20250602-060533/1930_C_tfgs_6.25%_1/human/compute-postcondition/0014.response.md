The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and adv, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `adv`. If `j` is less than `adv`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `adv` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `j` must be increased by 1 so `j` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `adv` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order that must have at least 1 integer, `counter` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in the original list `a`, `cnt` is the number of duplicate integers in the original list `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, `i` is greater than 0, `adv` is greater than 1, and `j` is 1**
