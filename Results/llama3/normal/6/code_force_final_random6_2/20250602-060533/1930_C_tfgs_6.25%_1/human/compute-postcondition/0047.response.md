To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and `cnt`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `cnt`. If `cnt` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `cnt` is 0, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `cnt` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the execution of the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an empty list, `counter` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in the original list `a`, `cnt` must be greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing all the integers from the original list `a` in descending order, with the integers `a[i - 1] - j - 1` for `j` ranging from 0 to `adv - 1` inserted between each pair of adjacent integers `a[i - 1]` and `a[i]` if `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1` is greater than 0, and `counter[a[i]]` is 0 for all `i`**
