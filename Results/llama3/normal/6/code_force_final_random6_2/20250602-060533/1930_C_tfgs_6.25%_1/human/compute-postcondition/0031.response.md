Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order that must have at least 2 integers, counter is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in the original list a, cnt is the number of duplicate integers in the original list a minus adv, ans is a list containing the values a[i - 1] - j - 1 for j ranging from 0 to adv - 1 if i is greater than 0, otherwise ans is an empty list, i is greater than or equal to 1, adv is the minimum of a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, and counter[a[i - 1]], ans also contains the value a[i], and counter[a[i]] is one less than its original value, j is adv, and ans now contains the value a[i - 1] - adv - 1, and counter[a[i - 1]] is adv less than its original value.**
