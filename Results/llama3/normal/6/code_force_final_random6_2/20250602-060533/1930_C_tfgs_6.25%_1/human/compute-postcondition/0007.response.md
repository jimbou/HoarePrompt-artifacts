Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `i` is increased by `i + 1`, `i` is `n - 1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `n` remains unchanged, the list `a` will have each of its elements increased by a value equal to its index plus one, the loop counter `i` will be one less than the value of `n`, and the state of the standard input remains unchanged.
