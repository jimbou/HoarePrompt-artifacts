Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order that must have at least 2 integers, `counter` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in the original list `a`, `cnt` is the number of duplicate integers in the original list `a`, `ans` is a list containing the values `a[i - 1] - j - 1` for `j` ranging from 0 to `adv - 1` if `i` is greater than 0, otherwise `ans` is an empty list, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `adv` is the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `counter[a[i - 1]]`, `ans` also contains the value `a[i]`, and `counter[a[i]]` is one less than its original value**.

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of the variable `adv` which is assigned the minimum value among `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `counter[a[i - 1]]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
