Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order that must have at least 2 integers, counter is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in the original list a, cnt is the number of duplicate integers in the original list a minus adv, ans is a list containing the values a[i - 1] - j - 1 for j ranging from 0 to adv - 1 if i is greater than 0, otherwise ans is an empty list, i is greater than or equal to 2, and counter[a[i - 1]] is the frequency of a[i - 1] minus adv if i is greater than 0, ans also contains the value a[i], and counter[a[i]] is one less than its original value. If i > 0, then adv is equal to counter[a[i - 1]], ans now contains the value a[i - 1] - adv - 1, and counter[a[i - 1]] is adv less than its original value, and j is adv - 1, and ans now contains the value a[i - 1] - j - 1 which is a[i - 1] - adv.**

The code modifies the values of `cnt` and `counter[a[i - 1]]`. The value of `cnt` is decremented by `adv`, and the value of `counter[a[i - 1]]` is decremented by `adv`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
