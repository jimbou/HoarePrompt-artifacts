The only variable in the loop head is variable `cnt`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cnt`. If `cnt` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `cnt` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `cnt` must be decreased by 1.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an empty list, `counter` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in the original list `a`, `cnt` is greater than 0, `cnt` is decreased by 1, `ans` is a list containing all the integers from the original list `a` in descending order, with the integers `a[i - 1] - j - 1` for `j` ranging from 0 to `adv - 1` inserted between each pair of adjacent integers `a[i - 1]` and `a[i]` if `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1` is greater than 0, and `counter[a[i]]` is 0 for all `i`, and the last element of `ans` is decreased by 1**
