Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order that must have at least 2 integers, `counter` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in the original list `a`, `cnt` is the number of duplicate integers in the original list `a`, `ans` is a list containing the values `a[i - 1] - j - 1` for `j` ranging from 0 to `adv - 1` if `i` is greater than 0, otherwise `ans` is an empty list, `i` is greater than or equal to 2, and `counter[a[i - 1]]` is the frequency of `a[i - 1]` minus `adv` if `i` is greater than 0, `ans` also contains the value `a[i]`, and `counter[a[i]]` is one less than its original value. If `i > 0`, then `adv` is at least 1, `ans` now contains the value `a[i - 1] - adv - 1`, and `counter[a[i - 1]]` is `adv` less than its original value, and `j` is 0, and `ans` now contains the value `a[i - 1] - j - 1` which is `a[i - 1] - 1`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `ans` now contains an additional value, which is `a[i - 1] - 1`. This is because the code appends the value `a[i - 1] - j - 1` to the list `ans`, where `j` is 0.
