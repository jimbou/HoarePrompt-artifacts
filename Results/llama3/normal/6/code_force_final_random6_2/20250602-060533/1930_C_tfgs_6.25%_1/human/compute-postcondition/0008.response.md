Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order, counter is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in the original list a, cnt is the number of duplicate integers in the original list a, ans is an empty list, i is n - 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The list `a` is transformed into a sorted list of unique integers in descending order, with duplicates removed. The `counter` dictionary contains the frequency of each integer in the original list `a`. The variable `cnt` represents the number of duplicate integers in the original list `a`, calculated as the difference between the original length of `a` (`n`) and the length of the unique list `a`. The list `ans` is initialized as an empty list. The value of `i` remains unchanged as `n - 1`. The state of stdin is also unchanged, containing multiple test cases minus one.
