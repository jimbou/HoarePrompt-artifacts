To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, n + 1):`. The variables involved are `i` and `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer and is at least 1.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n + 1`. Since `i` is 1, we need to increment it by 1 to make it 2. Additionally, `n` must be at least 2 to satisfy the condition `i < n + 1`.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `t` remains greater than or equal to 0 and is one less than its original value (no change)
* `n` is an integer and is at least 2 (increased from at least 1)
* `i` is 2 (incremented from 1)

The other variables, such as the printed values, are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution.

State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer and is at least 2, `i` is 2**
