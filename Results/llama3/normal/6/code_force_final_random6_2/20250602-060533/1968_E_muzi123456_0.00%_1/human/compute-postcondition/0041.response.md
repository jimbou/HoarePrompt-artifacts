According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is truthy, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a truthy value minus one. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, and the number 1 is being printed, and the value of `i` which is `n` is being printed, and a space is being printed**
