Output State: **`t` is greater than -1, `i` is `n`, and '1' is printed, and the value of `i` which is `n` is being printed**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the value of `t` remains greater than -1 (as it was in the initial state), the value of `i` is equal to `n` (since the loop iterates from 1 to `n`), and the numbers '1' and `n` are printed.
