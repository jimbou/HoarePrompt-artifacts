According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is true, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than -1, which does not ensure that the loop will execute again, because `t` could be 0, which is a falsey value in Python. Therefore, `t` needs to be adjusted to be a truthy value.

State: **`t` is a truthy value, `i` is `n`, and '1' is printed, and the value of `i` which is `n` is being printed, and a space is being printed**
