To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the given state.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, n + 1):`. This means that the loop will iterate over the range of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

The given state at the end of the previous iteration is:

* `t` is greater than -1
* `i` is 2
* `n` must be greater than 1
* '1' is printed
* The value of `i` which is 2 is being printed

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

* The loop will only execute again if `i` is less than `n`.
* Since `i` is currently 2, it needs to be incremented by 1 to 3 for the loop to execute again.
* Since `n` must be greater than 1, it must also be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is greater than -1, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 2**
