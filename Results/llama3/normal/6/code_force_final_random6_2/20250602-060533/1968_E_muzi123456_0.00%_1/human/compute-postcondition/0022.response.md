Output State: **t is a truthy value minus one, i is n, '1' is printed, the value of i which is n is being printed, a space is being printed, n is an integer**.

In this final state, the value of `t` has been decremented by one, but it remains a truthy value. The value of `i` remains unchanged, still equal to `n`. The print statements have been executed, so '1', the value of `i` (which is `n`), and a space have been printed. The value of `n` has been updated to an integer value read from the input.
