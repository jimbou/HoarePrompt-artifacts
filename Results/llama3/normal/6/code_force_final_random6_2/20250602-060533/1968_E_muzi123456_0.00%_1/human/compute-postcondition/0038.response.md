Output State: **`t` is a truthy value minus one, `i` is `n`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, and the number 1 is being printed, and the value of `i` which is `n` is being printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` remains unchanged (it is still a truthy value minus one), the value of `i` has reached the value of `n`, and the value of `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1. Additionally, the number 1 is being printed, followed by the value of `i` which is now equal to `n`.
