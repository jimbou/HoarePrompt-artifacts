Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer, `i` is `n`, '1' is printed `n` times, and the value of `i` which is `n` is printed `n` times.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` remains unchanged, `n` is still an integer, and `i` has returned to its original value which is `n`. The loop has printed '1' `n` times, and the value of `i` (which is `n`) has also been printed `n` times.
