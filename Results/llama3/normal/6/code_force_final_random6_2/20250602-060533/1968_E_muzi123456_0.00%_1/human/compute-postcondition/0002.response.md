Output State: **t is greater than -1, n is an integer**

The first line decrements `t` by 1, making it greater than -1. The second line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since stdin contains no input, the program will wait for user input to assign a value to `n`. The value of `n` is an integer. No other variables are affected.
