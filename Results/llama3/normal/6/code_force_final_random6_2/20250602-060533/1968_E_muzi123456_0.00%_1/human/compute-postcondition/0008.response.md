To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects within it.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, n + 1):`. The objects in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, and '1' is printed.

To adjust the states for the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1, so `i` becomes 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

The state of `t` is not affected by the loop head, so it remains greater than -1.

State: **`t` is greater than -1, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1**
