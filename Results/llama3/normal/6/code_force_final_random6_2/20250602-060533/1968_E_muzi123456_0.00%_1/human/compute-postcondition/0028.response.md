To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.

The value of `n` is an integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`, which is 2. Therefore, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

The state of `t` is not relevant to the loop head, so it remains unchanged.

The state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is a truthy value minus one, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3**
