The `print` statement is executed with the argument `'1'` and the `end` parameter set to `' '`. This means that the string `'1'` will be printed, followed by a space.

Since the initial state does not provide any additional information about the variables `t`, `i`, or `n`, we can ignore them for this specific `print` statement.

Output: **1**
