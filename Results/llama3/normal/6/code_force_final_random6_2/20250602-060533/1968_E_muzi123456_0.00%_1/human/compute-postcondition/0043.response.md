To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1.

Since `i` is `n` before the loop starts, we need to adjust `i` to be 1, which is the starting value of the range. We also need to adjust `n` to be at least 1, so that the loop can execute.

State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer and is at least 1, `i` is 1**
