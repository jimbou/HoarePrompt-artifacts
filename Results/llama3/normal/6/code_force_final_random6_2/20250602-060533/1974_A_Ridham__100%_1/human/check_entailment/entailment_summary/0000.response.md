Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It accurately calculates the minimum number of screens required to display a given number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons. The program first calculates the total space required for the icons, then determines the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons. It then checks if the remaining space on those screens is sufficient to accommodate the 1x1 icons. If not, it calculates the additional screens required to display the remaining 1x1 icons.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including when the number of 2x2 icons is even or odd, and when the space required for the 1x1 icons exceeds the available space on the screens required for the 2x2 icons.

Correctness: **True**
