Output State: **n is at least 1, result is an empty list, x is an integer between 0 and 99, y is an integer between 0 and 99, space_x is equal to x, space_y is equal to 4 times y, total_space is equal to 5 times y plus x, screen_require_for_y is equal to half of y if y is even, otherwise screen_require_for_y is equal to y // 2 + 1, remaining_cells is equal to 15 times screen_require_for_y minus space_y, and stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99).**

In this output state, the value of remaining_cells is calculated based on the values of screen_require_for_y and space_y. If y is even, screen_require_for_y is equal to half of y, and if y is odd, screen_require_for_y is equal to y // 2 + 1. The value of remaining_cells is then calculated as 15 times screen_require_for_y minus space_y. The other variables remain unchanged.
