Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `result` is a list containing either `screen_require_for_y` if `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` if `space_x` is greater than `remaining_cells`, `x` is an integer between 0 and 99, `y` is an integer between 0 and 99, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to 4 times `y`, `total_space` is equal to 5 times `y` plus `x`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`, `remaining_cells` is equal to 15 times `screen_require_for_y` minus `space_y`, and stdin contains either `t-3` lines if `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, or `t-4` lines if `space_x` is greater than `remaining_cells`, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99)**

In this output state, the value of `screen_require_for_y` has been updated to `y // 2 + 1`, which means it is now always one more than the integer division of `y` by 2, regardless of whether `y` is even or odd. The other variables remain unchanged.
