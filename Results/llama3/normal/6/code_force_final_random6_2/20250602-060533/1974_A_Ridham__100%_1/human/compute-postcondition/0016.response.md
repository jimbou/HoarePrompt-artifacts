Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `result` is an empty list, `x` is an integer between 0 and 99, `y` is an integer between 0 and 99, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to 4 times `y`, `total_space` is equal to 5 times `y` plus `x`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to half of `y` if `y` is even, otherwise `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`, `remaining_cells` is equal to 15 times `screen_require_for_y` minus `space_y`, `extra_space` is equal to `space_x` minus `remaining_cells`, `extra_screen` is equal to `extra_space` divided by 15 plus 1, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99), `space_x` is more than `remaining_cells`, and `extra_space` is not a multiple of 15**

In this output state, all the initial state variables remain unchanged except for the new variable `extra_screen`, which is calculated as `extra_space` divided by 15 plus 1. The value of `extra_screen` is now a new piece of information in the output state.
