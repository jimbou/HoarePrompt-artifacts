Output State: **`n` is 0, `result` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is either `screen_require_for_y` if `space_x` is less than or equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` if `space_x` is greater than `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `x` is an integer between 0 and 99, `y` is an integer between 0 and 99, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to 4 times `y`, `total_space` is equal to 5 times `y` plus `x`, `screen_require_for_y` is either half of `y` (integer division) if `y` is even or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, and stdin is empty.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `n` will be 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The `result` list will contain `n` elements, where each element is either the required screen size for the current `y` value if the space required for `x` is less than or equal to the remaining cells, or the sum of the extra screen size and the required screen size for `y` if the space required for `x` is greater than the remaining cells. The values of `x`, `y`, `space_x`, `space_y`, `total_space`, `screen_require_for_y`, and `remaining_cells` will be as defined in the loop body. Finally, the standard input (stdin) will be empty, indicating that all input lines have been processed.
