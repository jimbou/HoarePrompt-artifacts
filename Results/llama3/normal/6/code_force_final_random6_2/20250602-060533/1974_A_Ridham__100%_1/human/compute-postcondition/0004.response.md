Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `result` is an empty list, `x` is an integer between 0 and 99, `y` is an even integer between 0 and 99, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to 4 times `y`, `total_space` is equal to 5 times `y` plus `x`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to half of `y`, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing two space-separated integers.**

In this output state, the value of `screen_require_for_y` has been updated to be half of the current value of `y`, which is an even integer between 0 and 99. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains t-2 lines of input.
