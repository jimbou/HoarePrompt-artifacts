Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 1 and 10^4, result is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99)
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
    space_x = x * 1
    space_y = y * 4
    total_space = space_y + space_x
    if y % 2 == 0:
        screen_require_for_y = y // 2
    else:
        screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1
    remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y
    if space_x <= remaining_cells:
        result.append(screen_require_for_y)
    else:
        extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells
        if extra_space % 15 == 0:
            extra_screen = extra_space // 15
        else:
            extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1
        result.append(extra_screen + screen_require_for_y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is at least 1, result is a list, x is an integer between 0 and 99, y is an integer between 0 and 99, space_x is equal to x, space_y is equal to 4 times y, total_space is equal to 5 times y plus x, screen_require_for_y is equal to half of y if y is even, otherwise screen_require_for_y is equal to y // 2 + 1, remaining_cells is equal to 15 times screen_require_for_y minus space_y, and stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99). If space_x is less than or equal to remaining_cells, then result is a list containing screen_require_for_y. Otherwise, result is a list containing one element which is the sum of extra_screen and screen_require_for_y, extra_space is equal to space_x minus remaining_cells, extra_screen is equal to extra_space divided by 15 if extra_space is a multiple of 15, otherwise extra_screen is equal to extra_space divided by 15 plus 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is at least 2, `result` is a list containing either `screen_require_for_y` if `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` if `space_x` is greater than `remaining_cells`, `x` is an integer between 0 and 99, `y` is an integer between 0 and 99, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to 4 times `y`, `total_space` is equal to 5 times `y` plus `x`, `screen_require_for_y` is either half of `y` (integer division) if `y` is even or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd, `remaining_cells` is equal to 15 times `screen_require_for_y` minus `space_y`, and stdin contains either t-3 lines if `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, or t-4 lines if `space_x` is greater than `remaining_cells`, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is at least 1, `result` is a list containing either `screen_require_for_y` if `space_x` is less than or equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` if `space_x` is greater than `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, and an additional `screen_require_for_y` if `space_x` is less than or equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, otherwise an additional element `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, `x` is an integer between 0 and 99, `y` is an integer between 0 and 99, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to 4 times `y`, `total_space` is equal to 5 times `y` plus `x`, `screen_require_for_y` is either half of `y` (integer division) if `y` is even or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, and stdin contains either `t-3` lines if `space_x` is less than or equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, or `t-4` lines if `space_x` is greater than `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99). If `space_x` is greater than `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `extra_space` is equal to `space_x - remaining_cells`, and `extra_screen` is equal to `extra_space // 15` if `extra_space` is a multiple of 15, otherwise `extra_screen` is equal to `extra_space // 15 + 1




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
