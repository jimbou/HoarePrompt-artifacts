Postcondition: ***n is at least 1, result is a list, x is an integer between 0 and 99, y is an integer between 0 and 99, space_x is equal to x, space_y is equal to 4 times y, total_space is equal to 5 times y plus x, screen_require_for_y is equal to half of y if y is even, otherwise screen_require_for_y is equal to y // 2 + 1, remaining_cells is equal to 15 times screen_require_for_y minus space_y, and stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99). If space_x is less than or equal to remaining_cells, then result is a list containing screen_require_for_y. Otherwise, result is a list containing one element which is the sum of extra_screen and screen_require_for_y, extra_space is equal to space_x minus remaining_cells, extra_screen is equal to extra_space divided by 15 if extra_space is a multiple of 15, otherwise extra_screen is equal to extra_space divided by 15 plus 1.***
