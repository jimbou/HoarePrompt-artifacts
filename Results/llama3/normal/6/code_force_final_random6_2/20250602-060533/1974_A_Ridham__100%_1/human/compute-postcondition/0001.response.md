According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, which ensures that the loop will execute. So, `n` needs to be adjusted to be at least 1.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `result` is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99)**
