Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `result` is a list containing either `screen_require_for_y` if `space_x` is less than or equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` if `space_x` is greater than `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `x` is an integer between 0 and 99, `y` is an integer between 0 and 99, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to 4 times `y`, `total_space` is equal to 5 times `y` plus `x`, `screen_require_for_y` is either half of `y` (integer division) if `y` is even or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, and stdin contains either `t-3` lines if `space_x` is less than or equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, or `t-4` lines if `space_x` is greater than `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99).**

In this output state, the value of `remaining_cells` has been updated to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, which is a more specific expression based on the initial state. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains either `t-3` or `t-4` lines depending on the condition.
