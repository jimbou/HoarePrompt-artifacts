Postcondition: ***n is at least 2, result is a list, x is an integer between 0 and 99, y is an integer between 0 and 99, space_x is equal to x, space_y is equal to 4 times y, total_space is equal to 5 times y plus x, and stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99). If y is even, screen_require_for_y is equal to half of y (integer division) and remaining_cells is equal to 15 times screen_require_for_y minus space_y. If y is odd, screen_require_for_y is equal to y // 2 + 1 and remaining_cells is equal to 15 times screen_require_for_y minus space_y.***
