Output State: **n is at least 2, result is a list, x is an integer between 0 and 99, y is an integer between 0 and 99, space_x is equal to x, space_y is equal to 4 times y, total_space is equal to 5 times y plus x, screen_require_for_y is equal to half of y if y is even, otherwise screen_require_for_y is equal to y // 2 + 1, remaining_cells is equal to 15 times screen_require_for_y minus space_y, and stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99).**

The code block reads two space-separated integers from stdin and assigns them to `x` and `y`, respectively. The values of `x` and `y` are then used to calculate `space_x`, `space_y`, and `total_space`. The values of `n`, `result`, `screen_require_for_y`, and `remaining_cells` are not affected by the code block. The stdin now contains `t-3` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y`.
