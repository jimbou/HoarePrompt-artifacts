Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^4, result is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99)**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`, which is between 1 and 10^4. The second line initializes an empty list `result`. No other variables are affected. The state of `stdin` is updated to contain `t-1` lines, each with two space-separated integers `x` and `y`, as one line has been consumed by the `input()` function.
