Output: **`n` is 0, `result` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is either `screen_require_for_y` if `space_x` is less than or equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` if `space_x` is greater than `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `x` is an integer between 0 and 99, `y` is an integer between 0 and 99, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to 4 times `y`, `total_space` is equal to 5 times `y` plus `x`, `screen_require_for_y` is either half of `y` (integer division) if `y` is even or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, and stdin is empty, and the following is printed: a string containing the elements of the `result` list, each on a new line**
