Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `result` is a list, `x` is an integer between 0 and 99, `y` is an integer between 0 and 99, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to 4 times `y`, `total_space` is equal to 5 times `y` plus `x`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to half of `y` (integer division), `remaining_cells` is equal to 15 times `screen_require_for_y` minus `space_y`, and stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99).**

In this output state, the value of `screen_require_for_y` has been updated to be half of `y` (integer division), which means it will be the integer part of `y` divided by 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
