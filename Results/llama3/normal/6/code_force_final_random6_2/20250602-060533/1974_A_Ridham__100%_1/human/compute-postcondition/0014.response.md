Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `result` is an empty list, `x` is an integer between 0 and 99, `y` is an integer between 0 and 99, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to 4 times `y`, `total_space` is equal to 5 times `y` plus `x`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to half of `y` if `y` is even, otherwise `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`, `remaining_cells` is equal to 15 times `screen_require_for_y` minus `space_y`, `extra_space` is equal to `space_x` minus `remaining_cells`, `extra_screen` is equal to `extra_space` divided by 15, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99), and `space_x` is more than `remaining_cells`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `extra_screen` which is equal to `extra_space` divided by 15. The value of `extra_screen` is an integer because `extra_space` is a multiple of 15. The values of the other variables remain the same, and the stdin still contains t-2 lines of input.
