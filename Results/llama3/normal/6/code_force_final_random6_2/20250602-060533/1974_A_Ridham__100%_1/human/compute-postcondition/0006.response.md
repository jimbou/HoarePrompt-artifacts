Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `result` is an empty list, `x` is an integer between 0 and 99, `y` is an odd integer between 0 and 99, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to 4 times `y`, `total_space` is equal to 5 times `y` plus `x`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`, and stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99).**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains at least 1, the `result` list is still empty, and the values of `x`, `y`, `space_x`, `space_y`, and `total_space` remain the same. A new variable `screen_require_for_y` is introduced, which is calculated as `y // 2 + 1`, where `y` is an odd integer between 0 and 99. The stdin still contains t-2 lines of input, each with two space-separated integers.
