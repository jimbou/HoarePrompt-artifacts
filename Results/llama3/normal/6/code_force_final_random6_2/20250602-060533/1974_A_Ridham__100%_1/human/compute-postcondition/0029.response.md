Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `result` is a list, `x` is an integer between 0 and 99, `y` is an integer between 0 and 99, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to 4 times `y`, `total_space` is equal to 5 times `y` plus `x`, `screen_require_for_y` is either half of `y` (integer division) if `y` is even or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd, `remaining_cells` is equal to 15 times `screen_require_for_y` minus `space_y`, `extra_space` is equal to `space_x` minus `remaining_cells`, `extra_screen` is equal to `extra_space // 15 + 1`, and stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99).**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `result`, `x`, `y`, `space_x`, `space_y`, `total_space`, `screen_require_for_y`, `remaining_cells`, and `extra_space` remain the same as in the initial state. A new variable `extra_screen` is introduced, which is equal to `extra_space // 15 + 1`. The stdin still contains t-3 lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99).
