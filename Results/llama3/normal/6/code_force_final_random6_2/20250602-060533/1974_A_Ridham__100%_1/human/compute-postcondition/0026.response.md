Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `result` is a list containing `screen_require_for_y`, `x` is an integer between 0 and 99, `y` is an integer between 0 and 99, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to 4 times `y`, `total_space` is equal to 5 times `y` plus `x`, `screen_require_for_y` is either half of `y` (integer division) if `y` is even or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd, and `remaining_cells` is equal to 15 times `screen_require_for_y` minus `space_y` which is 15 times (either half of `y` or `y // 2 + 1`) minus 4 times `y`, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99).**

In this output state, the value of `screen_require_for_y` has been appended to the `result` list. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains t-3 lines of input. The `screen_require_for_y` value is either half of `y` (integer division) if `y` is even or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd.
