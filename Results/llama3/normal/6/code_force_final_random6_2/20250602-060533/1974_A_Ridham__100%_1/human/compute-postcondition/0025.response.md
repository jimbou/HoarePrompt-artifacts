Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `result` is a list, `x` is an integer between 0 and 99, `y` is an integer between 0 and 99, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to 4 times `y`, `total_space` is equal to 5 times `y` plus `x`, `screen_require_for_y` is either half of `y` (integer division) if `y` is even or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd, and `remaining_cells` is equal to 15 times `screen_require_for_y` minus `space_y` which is 15 times (either half of `y` or `y // 2 + 1`) minus 4 times `y`. stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99).**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state except that the value of `remaining_cells` has been updated based on the values of `screen_require_for_y` and `space_y`. The value of `remaining_cells` is now calculated as 15 times the screen requirement for `y` minus the space occupied by `y`, which depends on whether `y` is even or odd. All other variables remain unchanged.
