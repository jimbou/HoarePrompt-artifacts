Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in all cases. For example, consider the input:

3
4
12 3 45 67

The program will split the first element 12 into 1 and 2, resulting in the list [1, 2, 3, 45, 67]. However, it will not split the element 45, which is greater than 10, into 4 and 5, resulting in the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67]. This is because the program only splits the element at the previous index if it is greater than the current element and greater than 10. It does not recursively split the elements.

Therefore, the program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make the array sorted in non-descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times.
