#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of non-negative integers, each less than or equal to 99.
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the list 'lst' of non-negative integers (each less than or equal to 99) is sorted in ascending order.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function checks if a given list of non-negative integers (each less than or equal to 99) is sorted in ascending order and returns a boolean value indicating the result. The function does not modify the original list.
