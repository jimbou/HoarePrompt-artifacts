Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to make a sorted array in non-decreasing order by applying the given operation any number of times. The operation involves deleting an element that is at least 10 and inserting its digits in the same position.

The program iterates through the input list and checks if the current element is greater than the next element and if the current element is greater than 10. If both conditions are true, it splits the current element into its digits and inserts them into the list.

After modifying the list, the program calls the function `func_1` to check if the list is sorted in ascending order. If the list is sorted, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The program only checks if the current element is greater than the next element and if the current element is greater than 10. It does not consider the case where the current element is less than or equal to the next element but still greater than 10. In such cases, the program should not split the current element.

For example, consider the input list [12, 3, 45, 67]. The program will split the first element into its digits, resulting in the list [1, 2, 3, 45, 67]. However, it will not split the third element (45) because it is not greater than the next element (67). As a result, the program will incorrectly print 'No' because the list [1, 2, 3, 45, 67] is not sorted in ascending order.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
