Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to make a sorted array in non-descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times. 

The program first reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself. 

The program then iterates over the array from the second element to the end. If it finds an element that is smaller than its previous element and the previous element is greater than 10, it splits the previous element into two digits and inserts them into the array. 

After modifying the array, the program checks if the array is sorted by comparing it with its sorted version using the `func_1` function. If the array is sorted, it prints 'Yes', otherwise, it prints 'No'.

However, there are a couple of issues with the program. 

1. The `func_1` function is not necessary. The program can simply use the built-in `sorted` function to check if the array is sorted.

2. The program does not handle the case where the first element of the array is greater than 10 and needs to be split. 

3. The program does not handle the case where the array has less than two elements.

4. The program does not handle the case where the input array is not a list of integers.

5. The program does not handle the case where the input array is empty.

6. The program does not handle the case where the input array contains non-integer values.

7. The program does not handle the case where the input array contains negative integers.

8. The program does not handle the case where the input array contains integers greater than 99.

9. The program does not handle the case where the input array contains duplicate integers.

10. The program does not handle the case where the input array is already sorted.

Correctness: **False**
