Reasoning:
The given program is incorrect. The program attempts to sort the list by splitting numbers greater than 10 into their digits when they are greater than the next number in the list. However, this approach is flawed because it only checks and splits the numbers once, without considering the possibility that further splits might be needed to achieve a sorted list.

For example, consider the input [12, 3, 45, 67]. The program will split the first number into [1, 2, 3, 45, 67], but it will not split the 45 into [4, 5] because 45 is not greater than the next number 67. However, the correct output should be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67], which is a sorted list.

The program also uses a function func_1 to check if the list is sorted, but this function is not necessary because the program could simply check if the list is sorted after the loop.

Correctness: **False**
