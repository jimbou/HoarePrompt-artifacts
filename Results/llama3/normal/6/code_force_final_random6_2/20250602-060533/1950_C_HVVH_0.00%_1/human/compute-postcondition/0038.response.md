Output: **`day` is 'AM' or 'PM', `n` is an integer between 3 and 1439 inclusive, `h` is an integer between 0 and 23 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 0 and 59 inclusive, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-4` strings `s` of length 5 with format `hh:mm` representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. If `h` is 0, `day` is 'AM' and `h` is 12. Otherwise, if `h` is greater than 12, `day` is 'PM' and `h` is an integer between -12 and 11 inclusive. If `h` is 12, `day` is 'AM', and this is printed: a string in the format 'hh:mm' representing the time in 12-hour format where 'hh' is the value of `h` in two digits and 'mm' is the value of `m` in two digits, and the value of `day` which is either 'AM' or 'PM'**
