The code prints a formatted string containing the time in 12-hour format and the day indicator ('AM' or 'PM').

The time is represented by the variables `h` and `m`, which are integers between 1 and 12 inclusive and between 0 and 59 inclusive, respectively. The `:02d` format specifier in the print statement means that these values will be padded with leading zeros if necessary to make them two digits long.

The day indicator is represented by the variable `day`, which is either 'AM' or 'PM'. If `h` is 12, then `day` is 'AM'. If `h` is greater than 12, then `day` is 'PM' and `h` is decreased by 12. Otherwise, `day` is 'AM' and `h` remains unchanged.

Output: **hh:mm day (where hh is the hour in 12-hour format, mm is the minute, and day is either 'AM' or 'PM')**
