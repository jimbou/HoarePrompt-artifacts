Output: **`day` is 'AM' or 'PM', `n` is an integer between 2 and 1439 inclusive, `h` is an integer between 0 and 23 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 0 and 59 inclusive, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` strings `s` of length 5 with format `hh:mm` representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. If `h` is 0, then `day` is 'AM' and `h` is set to 12. Otherwise, if `h` was originally greater than 11, then `day` is 'PM' and `h` is decreased by 12. If `h` was originally 12, then `day` is 'AM'. Otherwise, `day` remains 'PM' and `h` remains unchanged, and this is printed: a string in the format 'hh:mm' representing the time in 12-hour format, where 'hh' is the value of `h` formatted to be two digits long and 'mm' is the value of `m` formatted to be two digits long, followed by the value of `day` which is either 'AM' or 'PM'.**
