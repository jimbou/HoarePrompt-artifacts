The code prints a formatted string representing a time in 12-hour format, followed by either 'AM' or 'PM'. The time is represented as hours and minutes, with leading zeros if necessary. The hours are adjusted based on the original value of `h` and the value of `day`.

Output: **hh:mm day (where hh is the adjusted hour between 01 and 12, mm is the minute between 00 and 59, and day is either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the original value of h and the value of day)**
