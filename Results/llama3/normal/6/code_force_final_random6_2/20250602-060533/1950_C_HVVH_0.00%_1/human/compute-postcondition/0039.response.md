Output State: **day is 'AM' or 'PM', n is 0, h is an integer between 0 and 23 inclusive, m is an integer between 0 and 59 inclusive, _ is n, stdin contains 0 strings s of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. If h is 0, then day is 'AM' and h is 12. Otherwise, if h is greater than 12, then day is 'PM' and h is an integer between -12 and 11 inclusive. If h is 12, then day is 'AM'.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the day is either 'AM' or 'PM', the number of iterations n is 0, the hour h is between 0 and 23, the minute m is between 0 and 59, and the loop counter _ is equal to the initial value of n. The standard input stdin is empty, containing no strings. The hour h and day are adjusted according to the same rules as before: if h is 0, day is 'AM' and h is set to 12; if h is greater than 12, day is 'PM' and h is decreased by 12; if h is 12, day is 'AM'.
