Output State: **`day` is 'AM', `n` is an integer between 2 and 1439 inclusive, `h` is an integer between 0 and 23 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 0 and 59 inclusive, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` strings `s` of length 5 with format `hh:mm` representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. If `h` is greater than 11, then `h` is decreased by 12.**

The value of `day` is changed to 'AM', while the values of `n`, `h`, `m`, and `_` remain the same. The condition that if `h` is greater than 11, then `h` is decreased by 12, is still valid. The stdin still contains `t-2` strings `s` of length 5 with format `hh:mm` representing a valid time in the 24-hour format.
