Output State: **`day` is 'AM' or 'PM', `n` is an integer between 3 and 1439 inclusive, `h` is an integer between 0 and 23 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 0 and 59 inclusive, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-4` strings `s` of length 5 with format `hh:mm` representing a valid time in the 24-hour format.**

In this output state, the values of `day`, `n`, and `_` remain unchanged. The value of `h` and `m` are updated to the hour and minute values of the first string `s` in the input, respectively. The stdin now contains `t-4` strings `s` of length 5 with format `hh:mm` representing a valid time in the 24-hour format, as one string has been consumed by the input operation.
