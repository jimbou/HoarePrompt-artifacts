Output State: **`day` is 'AM', `n` is an integer between 1 and 1439 inclusive, `h` is an integer between 0 and 23 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 0 and 59 inclusive, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings `s` of length 5 with format `hh:mm` representing a valid time in the 24-hour format.**

In this output state, the value of `day` remains 'AM', and the value of `n` is still an integer between 1 and 1440 inclusive but now it is between 1 and 1439 because one string has been read from stdin. The value of `h` and `m` are assigned the hour and minute from the first string in stdin, respectively. The value of `_` remains 0. The stdin now contains `t-1` strings because one string has been read.
