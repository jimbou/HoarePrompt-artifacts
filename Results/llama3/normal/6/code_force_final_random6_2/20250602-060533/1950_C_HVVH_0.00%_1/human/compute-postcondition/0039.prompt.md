Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: day is 'AM', n is an integer between 1 and 1440 inclusive, stdin contains t strings s of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    h, m = map(int, input().split(':'))
    if h == 0:
        h = 12
        day = 'AM'
    elif h > 12:
        h = h - 12
        day = 'PM'
    else:
        day = 'PM'
        if h == 12:
            day = 'AM'
    print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `day` is 'AM' or 'PM', `n` is an integer between 1 and 1439 inclusive, `h` is an integer between 1 and 12 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 0 and 59 inclusive, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings `s` of length 5 with format `hh:mm` representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. If `h` is 12, then `day` is 'AM'. If `h` is greater than 12, then `day` is 'PM' and `h` is decreased by 12. Otherwise, `day` is 'AM' and `h` remains unchanged. and this is printed: the time in 12-hour format, with hours between 1 and 12, minutes between 0 and 59, and the day as 'AM' or 'PM'

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `day` is 'AM' or 'PM', `n` is an integer between 2 and 1439 inclusive, `h` is an integer between 0 and 23 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 0 and 59 inclusive, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` strings `s` of length 5 with format `hh:mm` representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. If `h` is 0, then `day` is 'AM' and `h` is set to 12. Otherwise, if `h` was originally greater than 11, then `day` is 'PM' and `h` is decreased by 12. If `h` was originally 12, then `day` is 'AM'. Otherwise, `day` remains 'PM' and `h` remains unchanged, and this is printed: a string in the format 'hh:mm' representing the time in 12-hour format, where 'hh' is the value of `h` formatted to be two digits long and 'mm' is the value of `m` formatted to be two digits long, followed by the value of `day` which is either 'AM' or 'PM'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `day` is 'AM' or 'PM', `n` is an integer between 3 and 1439 inclusive, `h` is an integer between 0 and 23 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 0 and 59 inclusive, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-4` strings `s` of length 5 with format `hh:mm` representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. If `h` is 0, `day` is 'AM' and `h` is 12. Otherwise, if `h` is greater than 12, `day` is 'PM' and `h` is an integer between -12 and 11 inclusive. If `h` is 12, `day` is 'AM', and this is printed: a string in the format 'hh:mm' representing the time in 12-hour format where 'hh' is the value of `h` in two digits and 'mm' is the value of `m` in two digits, and the value of `day` which is either 'AM' or 'PM'




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
