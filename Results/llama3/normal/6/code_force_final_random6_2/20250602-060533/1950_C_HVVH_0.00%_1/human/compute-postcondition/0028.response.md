The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 1439 inclusive. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`day` is 'AM' or 'PM', `n` is an integer between 3 and 1439 inclusive, `h` is an integer between 0 and 23 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 0 and 59 inclusive, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` strings `s` of length 5 with format `hh:mm` representing a valid time in the 24-hour format.**
