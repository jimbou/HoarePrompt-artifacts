Output State: **`day` is 'AM' or 'PM', `n` is an integer between 2 and 1439 inclusive, `h` is an integer between 0 and 23 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 0 and 59 inclusive, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` strings `s` of length 5 with format `hh:mm` representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. If `h` is greater than 11, then `day` is 'PM' and `h` is decreased by 12. Otherwise, `day` is 'AM' and `h` remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `h` has been updated to be an integer between 0 and 23 inclusive, and the value of `m` has been updated to be an integer between 0 and 59 inclusive. The value of `day` is still either 'AM' or 'PM', but its value is now dependent on the value of `h`. If `h` is greater than 11, then `day` is 'PM' and `h` is decreased by 12. Otherwise, `day` is 'AM' and `h` remains unchanged. The values of `n`, `_`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
