The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 1439 inclusive. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`day` is 'AM' or 'PM', `n` is an integer between 2 and 1439 inclusive, `h` is an integer between 1 and 12 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 0 and 59 inclusive, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings `s` of length 5 with format `hh:mm` representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. If `h` is 12, then `day` is 'AM'. If `h` is greater than 12, then `day` is 'PM' and `h` is decreased by 12. Otherwise, `day` is 'AM' and `h` remains unchanged.**
