Output State: **day is 'PM', n is an integer between 3 and 1439 inclusive, h is an integer between -12 and 11 inclusive, m is an integer between 0 and 59 inclusive, _ is 2, stdin contains t-4 strings s of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `h` and `day`. The first line subtracts 12 from `h`, which was initially an integer between 0 and 23 inclusive. This operation changes the range of `h` to between -12 and 11 inclusive. The second line assigns the value 'PM' to `day`, which was initially either 'AM' or 'PM'. No other variables are affected by the code.
