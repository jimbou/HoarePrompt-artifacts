Postcondition: ***`day` is 'AM' or 'PM', `n` is an integer between 1 and 1439 inclusive, `h` is an integer between 1 and 12 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 0 and 59 inclusive, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings `s` of length 5 with format `hh:mm` representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. If `h` is 12, then `day` is 'AM'. If `h` is greater than 12, then `day` is 'PM' and `h` is decreased by 12. Otherwise, `day` is 'AM' and `h` remains unchanged.***
