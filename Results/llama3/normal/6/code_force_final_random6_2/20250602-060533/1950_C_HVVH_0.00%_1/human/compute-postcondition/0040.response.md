Functionality: **This function takes an integer t and t strings representing times in 24-hour format as input, converts each time to 12-hour format, and prints the converted time along with 'AM' or 'PM'. The function iterates through each input time, adjusts the hour and day accordingly, and outputs the result. After processing all input times, the function concludes, leaving the input stream empty.**
