The code snippet consists of two lines that assign values to the variables `h` and `day`. The first line sets `h` to 12, and the second line sets `day` to 'AM'. 

The initial state of `h` is 0, and the initial state of `day` is 'AM'. After the first line executes, `h` becomes 12. The second line does not change the value of `day` since it is already 'AM'. 

The other variables in the initial state (`n`, `m`, `_`, and `stdin`) are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **h is 12, day is 'AM', n is an integer between 1 and 1439 inclusive, m is an integer between 0 and 59 inclusive, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings s of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format.**
