The code prints a formatted string representing a time in 12-hour format. The hour part is represented by the value of `h`, which is an integer between 0 and 23 inclusive, but with special handling for certain values. If `h` is 0, it is set to 12 and the day is 'AM'. If `h` is greater than 12, it is adjusted to be between -12 and 11 inclusive, and the day is 'PM'. If `h` is 12, the day is 'AM'. The minute part is represented by the value of `m`, which is an integer between 0 and 59 inclusive. The time is formatted as `hh:mm`, with leading zeros if necessary.

Output: **hh:mm day (where hh is the adjusted hour value, mm is the minute value, and day is either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the hour value)**
