Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to convert 24-hour time format to 12-hour time format. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The function `func()` is defined, but it is not clear why it is defined as it is not being called anywhere in the program. However, for the purpose of this analysis, we will assume that it is being called.

2. Inside the function, the variable `day` is initialized to `'AM'`. This variable is used to store whether the time is in the morning (AM) or afternoon (PM).

3. The variable `n` is assigned the value of the first input, which is the number of test cases.

4. A for loop is used to iterate over each test case. In each iteration, the input time is split into hours (`h`) and minutes (`m`) using the `split()` function.

5. If the hour is 0, it is converted to 12 and the day is set to `'AM'`. This is correct because 00:00 in 24-hour format is equivalent to 12:00 AM in 12-hour format.

6. If the hour is greater than 12, it is subtracted by 12 and the day is set to `'PM'`. This is correct because, for example, 13:00 in 24-hour format is equivalent to 01:00 PM in 12-hour format.

7. If the hour is not 0 and not greater than 12, the day is set to `'PM'`. However, this is incorrect because if the hour is less than 12, the day should be `'AM'`, not `'PM'`. This is a logical error in the program.

8. If the hour is 12, the day is set to `'AM'`. However, this is incorrect because 12:00 in 24-hour format is equivalent to 12:00 PM in 12-hour format, not 12:00 AM.

9. Finally, the converted time is printed in the format `hh:mm day`.

Based on the analysis, the program has logical errors in steps 7 and 8. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
