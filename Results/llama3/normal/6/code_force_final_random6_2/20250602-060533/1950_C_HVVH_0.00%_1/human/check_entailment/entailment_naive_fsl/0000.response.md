Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when the input is 12:00, the program should output 12:00 PM, but it outputs 12:00 AM. This is because the program sets day to 'AM' when h is 0, but it does not handle the case where h is 12 correctly.

In the line `if h == 12: day = 'AM'`, the program sets day to 'AM' when h is 12, but this is incorrect. When h is 12, the day should be 'PM', not 'AM'. This is because 12:00 is noon, which is in the afternoon, not in the morning.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, and its correctness is **False**.
