Reasoning:

The given program is almost correct, but it has a logical error in the condition for setting the day to 'AM' or 'PM'. The current implementation sets the day to 'PM' for all hours between 1 and 11, which is incorrect. The correct implementation should set the day to 'AM' for hours between 1 and 11, and 'PM' for hours between 12 and 23.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
day = 'AM'
n = int(input())
for _ in range(n):
    h, m = map(int, input().split(':'))
    
    if h == 0:
        h = 12
        day = 'AM'
    elif h > 12:
        h = h - 12
        day = 'PM'
    elif h == 12:
        day = 'PM'
    else:
        day = 'AM'
        
    print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```

Correctness: **False**
