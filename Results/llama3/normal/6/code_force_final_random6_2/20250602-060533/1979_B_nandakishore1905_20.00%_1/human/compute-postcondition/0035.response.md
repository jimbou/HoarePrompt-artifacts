Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, k is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute difference between n and m, i is 2, stdin is empty**

The code first reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to n and m, respectively. This means that stdin is now empty. The second line calculates the absolute difference between n and m and assigns it to k. Since k was already defined as the absolute difference between n and m, its value remains the same. The value of i remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
