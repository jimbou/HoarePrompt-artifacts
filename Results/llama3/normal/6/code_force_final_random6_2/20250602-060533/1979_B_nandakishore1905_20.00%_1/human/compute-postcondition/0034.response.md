The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than the integer input, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, stdin is empty. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2. The loop will execute again if the integer input is greater than 1. So, the integer input must be greater than 1 and stdin must not be empty.
State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, k is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute difference between n and m, i is 2, stdin is not empty**
