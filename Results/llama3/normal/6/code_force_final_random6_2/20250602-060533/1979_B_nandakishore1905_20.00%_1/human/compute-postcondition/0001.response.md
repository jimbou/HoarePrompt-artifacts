Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, k is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute difference between n and m, i is 0, stdin is empty**

The code first reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to `n` and `m`, respectively. This leaves stdin empty. Then, it calculates the absolute difference between `n` and `m` and assigns this value to `k`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 0.
