The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and input(), so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value returned by `input()`. If `i` is less than the value returned by `input()`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `input()` is empty, and the value returned by `input()` is unknown. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and `input()` must not be empty and must return a value greater than 1.
State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, k is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute difference between n and m, i is 1, stdin is not empty and returns a value greater than 1**
