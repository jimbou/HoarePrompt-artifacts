Postcondition: ***n is an integer, m is an integer, k is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute difference between n and m, i is 1, stdin is empty. If the absolute difference between n and m, which is k, is a power of 2, then the absolute difference between n and m is being printed. If n is 0 and m is odd, the number 1 is being printed. If n is 0 and m is even, the number 2 is being printed. Otherwise, the difference between k and 2 raised to the power of the length of the binary string representation of k minus 1 is being printed.***
