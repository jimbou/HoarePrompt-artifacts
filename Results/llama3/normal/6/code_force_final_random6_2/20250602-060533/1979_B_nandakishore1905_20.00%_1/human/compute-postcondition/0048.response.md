Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, k is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute difference between n and m, i is equal to the number of test cases, stdin is empty. If k is a power of 2, the absolute difference between n and m which is k is printed. Otherwise, if n is 0 and m is odd, the number 1 is printed. If n is 0 and m is even, the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, the difference between k and 2 to the power of p-1 is printed, where p is the number of digits in the binary representation of k.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the values of n and m are still integers, and k is still the absolute difference between n and m. The variable i has reached the number of test cases, and the standard input (stdin) is empty, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The output of the loop is determined by the conditions inside the loop: if k is a power of 2, k is printed; if n is 0 and m is odd, 1 is printed; if n is 0 and m is even, 2 is printed; otherwise, the difference between k and 2 to the power of p-1 is printed, where p is the number of digits in the binary representation of k.
