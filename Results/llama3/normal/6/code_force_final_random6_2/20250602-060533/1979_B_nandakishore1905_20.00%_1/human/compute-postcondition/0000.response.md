To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and the input from `stdin`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there is input to read from `stdin`. Since `i` is initialized to 0 and will iterate over the range of the input integer, we need to ensure that the input integer is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **stdin contains at least one integer, `i` is 0**
