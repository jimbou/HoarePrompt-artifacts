The code snippet executes the following operations:

1. `l = bin(k).replace('0b', '')`: This line converts the integer `k` to a binary string and assigns it to `l`. The `bin()` function converts an integer to a binary string, and the `replace('0b', '')` method removes the '0b' prefix that `bin()` adds to the binary string.

2. `p = len(l)`: This line calculates the length of the binary string `l` and assigns it to `p`.

3. `q = 2 ** (p - 1)`: This line calculates 2 raised to the power of `p - 1` and assigns it to `q`.

After executing these lines, the state of the variables is as follows:

- `l` is a binary string representation of `k`.
- `p` is the length of the binary string `l`.
- `q` is 2 raised to the power of `p - 1`.

The initial state of `n`, `m`, `k`, `i`, and stdin remains unchanged.

Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, k is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute difference between n and m, i is 1, l is a binary string representation of k, p is the length of the binary string l, q is 2 raised to the power of p - 1, stdin is empty**
