Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, k is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute difference between n and m, i is 0, l is a string of binary digits representing k, p is the number of digits in l, q is 2 to the power of p-1.**

In this final state, the values of n, m, k, and i remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The variable l is assigned a string of binary digits representing the value of k, which is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute difference between n and m. The variable p is assigned the number of digits in the binary representation of k, and the variable q is assigned 2 to the power of p-1.
