The code prints the difference between k and q. k is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute difference between n and m, and q is 2 to the power of p-1. p is the number of digits in the binary representation of k. Therefore, the output will be the difference between the absolute difference of n and m, and 2 to the power of the number of digits in the binary representation of the absolute difference of n and m minus 1.
Output: **k - 2^(p-1) (where k is the absolute difference of n and m, and p is the number of digits in the binary representation of k)**
