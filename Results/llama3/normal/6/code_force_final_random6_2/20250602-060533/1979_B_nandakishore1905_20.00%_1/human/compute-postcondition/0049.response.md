Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers x and y. It calculates the absolute difference k between x and y and prints a value based on the following conditions: if k is a power of 2, it prints k; if x is 0 and y is odd, it prints 1; if x is 0 and y is even, it prints 2; otherwise, it prints the difference between k and 2 to the power of p-1, where p is the number of digits in the binary representation of k. The function processes all test cases and leaves the standard input empty.**
