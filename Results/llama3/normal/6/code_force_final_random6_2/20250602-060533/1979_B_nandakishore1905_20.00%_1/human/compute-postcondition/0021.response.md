Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, k is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute difference between n and m, i is 1, stdin is empty**

The code block reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to `n` and `m`, respectively. The value of `k` is then updated to be the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. The variable `i` remains unchanged. After the execution of the code, stdin is empty because it has been read.
