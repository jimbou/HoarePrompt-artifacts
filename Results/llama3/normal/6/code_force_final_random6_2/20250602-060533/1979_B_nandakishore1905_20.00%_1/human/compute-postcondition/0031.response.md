Postcondition: ***n is an integer, m is an integer, k is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute difference between n and m, i is 1, stdin is empty. If n is 0 and m is even, the number 2 is being printed. Otherwise, l is a binary string representation of k, p is the length of the binary string l, q is 2 raised to the power of p - 1, and the difference between k and q is being printed.***
