Reasoning:

The given program is correct. The program correctly determines whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the direction of the arrow in the second last cell of the second row.

The key insight here is that the robot can only move down from the first row to the second row, and then it must move right to reach the cell (2, n). If the arrow in the second last cell of the second row is pointing left ('<'), then the robot will move left and will not be able to reach the cell (2, n). On the other hand, if the arrow is pointing right ('>'), then the robot will move right and will be able to reach the cell (2, n).

The program correctly implements this logic by checking the direction of the arrow in the second last cell of the second row and printing 'Yes' if it is pointing right and 'No' if it is pointing left.

Correctness: **True**
