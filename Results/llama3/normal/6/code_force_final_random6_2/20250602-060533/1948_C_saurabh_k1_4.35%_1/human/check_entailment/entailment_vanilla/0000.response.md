Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by checking if the second last character in the second row is '<'. If it is, the program prints 'No', otherwise it prints 'Yes'. 

However, this approach is incorrect. The problem requires us to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) by moving left, right, down or up and then following the arrow in the current cell. The program does not take into account the movements of the robot and the arrows in the grid.

For example, consider the case where the input is:

4
>><<
>>><

The program will print 'Yes' because the second last character in the second row is '>'. However, the robot cannot reach the cell (2, 4) because it will get stuck in an infinite loop between cells (1, 2) and (1, 3).

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
