Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of strings, b is a list of strings, _ is 0**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `n` must be greater than 0, `n` becomes a positive integer. The second line assigns a list of strings from the input to `a`. The third line assigns a list of strings from the input to `b`. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0. Stdin now contains `t-1` test cases.
