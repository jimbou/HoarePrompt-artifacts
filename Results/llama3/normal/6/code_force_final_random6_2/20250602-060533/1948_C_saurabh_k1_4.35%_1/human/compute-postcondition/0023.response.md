Output State: **stdin is empty, n is an integer, a is a list of strings, b is a list of strings, _ is t-1. If the second last element of list b is '<', then 'No' is printed. Otherwise, 'Yes' is printed.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the input buffer (stdin) will be empty because all test cases have been processed. The variables n, a, and b will retain their last values from the last iteration of the loop. The loop counter variable _ will be one less than the total number of test cases (t-1). The output will be either 'No' or 'Yes' depending on the value of the second last element of list b in the last test case.
