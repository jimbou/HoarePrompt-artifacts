The only variable in the loop head is variable _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than the integer value of the input, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 0, the integer value of the input is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again _ must be 1 and the integer value of the input must be greater than 1.
