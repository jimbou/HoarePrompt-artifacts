Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and two strings of length n containing '<' and '>' characters. It then checks the second last character of the second string in each test case. If the character is '<', it prints 'No', otherwise it prints 'Yes'. The function processes all test cases and empties the standard input.**
