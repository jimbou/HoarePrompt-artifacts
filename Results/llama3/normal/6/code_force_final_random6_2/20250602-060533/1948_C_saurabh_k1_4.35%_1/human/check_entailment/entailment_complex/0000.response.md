Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The problem statement requires determining whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) in a grid with 2 rows and n columns, where each cell contains an arrow pointing either left or right. The robot starts at cell (1, 1) and moves left, right, down, or up, followed by moving along the arrow in the current cell.

2. The key insight to solving this problem is to realize that the robot can only reach the cell (2, n) if the second last cell in the second row (b[n - 2]) contains an arrow pointing to the right ('>'). This is because the robot needs to move right from the second last cell to reach the last cell.

3. The program correctly implements this insight by checking the second last character of the second string (b[n - 2]) in each test case. If it's '<', the program prints 'No', indicating that the robot cannot reach the cell (2, n). Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.

4. The program correctly handles the input format, reading the number of test cases, the integer n, and the two strings of length n for each test case.

5. The program processes all test cases and empties the standard input, as required.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
