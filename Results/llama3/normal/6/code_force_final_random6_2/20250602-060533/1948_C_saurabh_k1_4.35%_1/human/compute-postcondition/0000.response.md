The only variable in the loop head is variable _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable int(input()). If int(input()) is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to int(input()) is greater than 0 and _ is now 0. 
State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases, _ is 0, int(input()) must be greater than 0**
