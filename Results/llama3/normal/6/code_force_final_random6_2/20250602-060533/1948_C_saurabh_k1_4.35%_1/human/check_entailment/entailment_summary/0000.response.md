Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the provided problem description.

The key insight here is that the robot can only reach the cell (2, n) if the second last character of the second string is not '<'. This is because the robot moves left, right, down, or up first, and then moves along the arrow in the current cell. If the second last character of the second string is '<', it means that the robot will move left when it is in the second last cell of the second row, and therefore it cannot reach the last cell of the second row.

The program correctly checks this condition and prints 'Yes' if the second last character of the second string is not '<', and 'No' otherwise.

Correctness: **True**
