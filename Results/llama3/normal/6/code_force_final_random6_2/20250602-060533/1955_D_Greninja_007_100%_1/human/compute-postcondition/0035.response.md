Output State: **The program returns the sum of the minimum frequencies of common integers between sorted list `a` and sorted list `b` incremented by 1 if the sum of the minimum frequencies of common integers between sorted list `a` and sorted list `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, where `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `b` is a list of `m` integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^6, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m < n <= 2 * 10^5.**
