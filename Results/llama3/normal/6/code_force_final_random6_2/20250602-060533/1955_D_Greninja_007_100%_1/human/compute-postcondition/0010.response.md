Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m < n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `b` is a list of `m` integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^6, `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in sorted list `b`, `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in sorted list `a[:m+1]`, `sm` is the sum of the minimum frequencies of common integers between sorted list `a[:m+1]` and sorted list `b` incremented by 1 if the frequency of `a[r]` in `ca` is less than the frequency of `a[r]` in `cb`, `r` is `m`, and if the sum of the minimum frequencies of common integers between sorted list `a[:m+1]` and sorted list `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0. The current value of `ca[a[r - m]]` is less than or equal to `cb[a[r - m]]` and `sm` is reduced by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `sm` has been decremented by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
