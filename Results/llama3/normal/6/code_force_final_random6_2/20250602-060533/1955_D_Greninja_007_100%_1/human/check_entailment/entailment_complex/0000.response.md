Reasoning: The function `func_1` correctly calculates the number of sublists of length `m` in list `a` that have at least `k` common elements with list `b`. It uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each integer in both lists. The function then iterates over the list `a` from index `m` to `n`, updating the count of common elements and the answer accordingly. The function returns the correct count of sublists that meet the condition.

Correctness: **True**
