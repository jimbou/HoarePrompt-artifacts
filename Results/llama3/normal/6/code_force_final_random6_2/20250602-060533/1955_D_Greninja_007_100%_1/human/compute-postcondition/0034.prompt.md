Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *n, m, and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, b is a list of m integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^6, cb is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in sorted list b, ca is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in sorted list a[:m], and sm is the sum of the minimum frequencies of common integers between sorted list a[:m] and sorted list b. If the sum of the minimum frequencies of common integers between sorted list a[:m] and sorted list b is greater than or equal to k, then ans is 1. Otherwise, ans remains 0.
Code of the loop:
for r in range(m, n):
    if ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]]:
        sm += 1
    ca[a[r]] += 1
    if ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]]:
        sm -= 1
    ca[a[r - m]] -= 1
    if sm >= k:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m < n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `b` is a list of `m` integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^6, `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in sorted list `b`, `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in sorted list `a[:m+1]` with `ca[a[r - m]]` reduced by 1, `sm` is the sum of the minimum frequencies of common integers between sorted list `a[:m+1]` and sorted list `b` incremented by 1 if the frequency of `a[r]` in `ca` is less than the frequency of `a[r]` in `cb`, `r` is `m`. If the sum of the minimum frequencies of common integers between sorted list `a[:m+1]` and sorted list `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m < n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `b` is a list of `m` integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^6, `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in sorted list `b`, `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in sorted list `a[:m+2]` with `ca[a[m]]` reduced by 1 and `ca[a[r]]` incremented by 1 and `ca[a[r - m]]` decremented by 1, `sm` is the sum of the minimum frequencies of common integers between sorted list `a[:m+2]` and sorted list `b` incremented by 1 if the frequency of `a[m+1]` in `ca` is less than the frequency of `a[m+1]` in `cb`. If the frequency of `a[r]` in `ca` is less than the frequency of `a[r]` in `cb`, then the sum of the minimum frequencies of common integers between sorted list `a[:m+2]` and sorted list `b` is incremented by 1. If the sum of the minimum frequencies of common integers between sorted list `a[:m+2]` and sorted list `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0. If `ca[a[r - m]]` is less than or equal to `cb[a[r - m]]`, then `sm` is decremented by 1. If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m < n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `b` is a list of `m` integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^6, `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in sorted list `b`, `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in sorted list `a[:m+2]` with `ca[a[m]]` reduced by 1, `ca[a[r]]` incremented by 2, `ca[a[r - m]]` decremented by 2, `sm` is the sum of the minimum frequencies of common integers between sorted list `a[:m+2]` and sorted list `b` incremented by 1 if the frequency of `a[m+1]` in `ca` is less than the frequency of `a[m+1]` in `cb`. If the frequency of `a[r]` in `ca` is less than the frequency of `a[r]` in `cb`, then the sum of the minimum frequencies of common integers between sorted list `a[:m+2]` and sorted list `b` is incremented by 1. If the sum of the minimum frequencies of common integers between sorted list `a[:m+2]` and sorted list `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0. If `ca[a[r - m]]` is less than or equal to `cb[a[r - m]]`, then `sm` is decremented by 1. If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is incremented by 1, `r` is `m + 1, and `sm` is incremented by 1. If `ca[a[r]]` is not less than `cb[a[r]]`, then `sm` remains unchanged. If `ca[a[r - m]]` is greater than `cb[a[r - m]]`, then `sm` remains unchanged. If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
