Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m < n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `b` is a list of `m` integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^6, `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in sorted list `b`, `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in sorted list `a[:m]`, `sm` is the sum of the minimum frequencies of common integers between sorted list `a[:m]` and sorted list `b` plus 1, `r` is `m`, and if the sum of the minimum frequencies of common integers between sorted list `a[:m]` and sorted list `b` plus 1 is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0. The current value of `ca[a[r]]` is less than the current value of `cb[a[r]]`.**

In this output state, the value of `sm` has been incremented by 1, and the condition for `ans` has been updated accordingly. If the new value of `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 1; otherwise, it remains 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
