Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m < n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `b` is a list of `m` integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^6, `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in sorted list `b`, `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in sorted list `a[:m]`, `sm` is the sum of the minimum frequencies of common integers between sorted list `a[:m]` and sorted list `b`, `r` is `m`, and if the sum of the minimum frequencies of common integers between sorted list `a[:m]` and sorted list `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0. Additionally, if the frequency of `a[r]` in `ca` is less than the frequency of `a[r]` in `cb`, then `sm` is incremented by 1.**
