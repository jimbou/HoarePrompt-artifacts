Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m < n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `b` is a list of `m` integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^6, `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in sorted list `b`, `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in sorted list `a[:m+2]` with `ca[a[m]]` reduced by 1, `sm` is the sum of the minimum frequencies of common integers between sorted list `a[:m+2]` and sorted list `b` incremented by 1 if the frequency of `a[m+1]` in `ca` is less than the frequency of `a[m+1]` in `cb` incremented by 1, `r` is `m+1`. If the sum of the minimum frequencies of common integers between sorted list `a[:m+2]` and sorted list `b` incremented by 1 is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `sm` has been incremented by 1. This means that the sum of the minimum frequencies of common integers between sorted list `a[:m+2]` and sorted list `b` has increased by 1. If this sum is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 2; otherwise, `ans` remains 0.
