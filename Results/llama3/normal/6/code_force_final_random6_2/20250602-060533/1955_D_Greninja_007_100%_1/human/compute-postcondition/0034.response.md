Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m < n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `b` is a list of `m` integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^6, `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in sorted list `b`, `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in sorted list `a` with `ca[a[r - m]]` reduced by 1 for all `r` in range `m` to `n`, `sm` is the sum of the minimum frequencies of common integers between sorted list `a` and sorted list `b` incremented by 1 if the frequency of `a[r]` in `ca` is less than the frequency of `a[r]` in `cb` for all `r` in range `m` to `n`, `r` is `n`, and `ans` is the sum of the minimum frequencies of common integers between sorted list `a` and sorted list `b` incremented by 1 if the sum of the minimum frequencies of common integers between sorted list `a` and sorted list `b` is greater than or equal to `k`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

*   The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.
*   The list `a` remains unchanged.
*   The list `b` remains unchanged.
*   The Counter object `cb` remains unchanged.
*   The Counter object `ca` now contains the frequency of each integer in the entire sorted list `a`, with the frequency of `a[r - m]` reduced by 1 for all `r` in the range `m` to `n`.
*   The variable `sm` now holds the sum of the minimum frequencies of common integers between the entire sorted list `a` and the sorted list `b`, incremented by 1 if the frequency of `a[r]` in `ca` is less than the frequency of `a[r]` in `cb` for all `r` in the range `m` to `n`.
*   The variable `r` now holds the value `n`.
*   The variable `ans` now holds the sum of the minimum frequencies of common integers between the entire sorted list `a` and the sorted list `b`, incremented by 1 if the sum of the minimum frequencies of common integers between the entire sorted list `a` and the sorted list `b` is greater than or equal to `k`.
