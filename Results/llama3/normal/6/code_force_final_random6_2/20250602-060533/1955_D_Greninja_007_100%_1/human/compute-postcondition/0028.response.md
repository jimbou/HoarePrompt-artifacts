Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m < n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `b` is a list of `m` integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^6, `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in sorted list `b`, `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in sorted list `a[:m+2]` with `ca[a[m]]` reduced by 1, `ca[a[r]]` incremented by 2 and `ca[a[r - m]]` decremented by 1, `sm` is the sum of the minimum frequencies of common integers between sorted list `a[:m+2]` and sorted list `b` incremented by 1 if the frequency of `a[m+1]` in `ca` is less than the frequency of `a[m+1]` in `cb`. If the frequency of `a[r]` in `ca` is less than the frequency of `a[r]` in `cb`, then the sum of the minimum frequencies of common integers between sorted list `a[:m+2]` and sorted list `b` is incremented by 1. If the sum of the minimum frequencies of common integers between sorted list `a[:m+2]` and sorted list `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0. If `ca[a[r - m]]` is less than or equal to `cb[a[r - m]]`, then `sm` is decremented by 1. If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is incremented by 1, `r` is `m + 1, and `sm` is incremented by 1. If `ca[a[r]]` is not less than `cb[a[r]]`, then `sm` remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `ca[a[r]]` has been incremented by 1, and the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `sm` and `ans` are still dependent on the frequencies of common integers between sorted list `a[:m+2]` and sorted list `b`, and the relationship between `ca[a[r]]` and `cb[a[r]]`.
