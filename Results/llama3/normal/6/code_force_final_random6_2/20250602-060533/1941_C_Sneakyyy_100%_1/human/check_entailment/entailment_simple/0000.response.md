Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted from a given string to make it beautiful. A string is considered beautiful if it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map". The program iterates over the input string, checking every substring of length 3 to see if it matches either of these substrings. If a match is found, it increments the counter `ans` by 1 and moves the index `i` 3 positions forward. If no match is found, it simply moves the index `i` 1 position forward. The program then prints the value of `ans`, which represents the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. It correctly checks for the substrings "pie" and "map" in the input string and increments the counter `ans` accordingly. It also correctly handles the case where the input string does not contain either of these substrings, in which case it prints 0.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
