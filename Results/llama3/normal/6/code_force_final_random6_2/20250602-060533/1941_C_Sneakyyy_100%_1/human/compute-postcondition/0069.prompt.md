Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^6) followed by a string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    ans = 0
    i = 0
    while i < len(a) - 2:
        s = a[i:i + 3]
        if s == 'map' or s == 'pie':
            i += 3
            ans += 1
        else:
            i += 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The loop variable _ is still 0, stdin is empty, n is an integer greater than 0, a is a string, ans is the number of times 'map' or 'pie' appears in a as a substring of length 3, and i is equal to the length of a - 2, and the number of times 'map' or 'pie' appears in a as a substring of length 3 which is ans is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The value of `_` remains 1, `n` remains an integer, `a` remains a string, `ans` becomes the count of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in string `a`, `i` becomes equal to the length of string `a`, and `stdin` remains empty, and the count of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in string `a` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: _ is 2, n is an integer greater than 2, a is a string, ans is the number of occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in a, i is len(a), and stdin is empty, and the number of occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in a which is ans is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
