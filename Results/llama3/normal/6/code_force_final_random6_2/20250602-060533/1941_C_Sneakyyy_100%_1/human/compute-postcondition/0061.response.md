Output State: **_*_ is 2, n is an integer greater than 2, a is a string with length greater than i + 3, s is a substring of a starting at index i with length 3, i is less than len(a) - 1, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of s has been updated to be a substring of a starting at index i with length 3, instead of starting at index i - 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
