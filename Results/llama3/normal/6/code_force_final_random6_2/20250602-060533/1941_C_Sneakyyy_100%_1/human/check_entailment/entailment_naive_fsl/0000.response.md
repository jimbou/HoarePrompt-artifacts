Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when the string contains overlapping substrings "map" and "pie". For example, if the input string is "mapie", the program will count it as two separate substrings and output 2, but the correct output should be 1, because only one character needs to be removed to make the string beautiful.

In the given program, the while loop checks for the substrings "map" and "pie" and increments the answer by 1 if either of them is found. However, it does not consider the case when these substrings overlap. To fix this, the program should be modified to check for overlapping substrings and handle them correctly.
