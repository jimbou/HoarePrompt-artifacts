Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a string with a length of at least 2, `s` is a substring of `a` with a length of 3 starting from the `i`-th character, if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 4 and `a` must have a length greater than 5, otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 2 and `a` must have a length greater than 3.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `i` is now 4, otherwise, `i` is now 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
