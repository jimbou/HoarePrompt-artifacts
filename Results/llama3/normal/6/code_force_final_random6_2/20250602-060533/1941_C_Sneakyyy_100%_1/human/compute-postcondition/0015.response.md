Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a string with a length greater than the current value of `i` + 2, `s` is a substring of `a` with a length of 3 starting from the `i`-th character, if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 2 and `i` is 6 and `a` must have a length greater than 5. If `s` is not 'map' or 'pie', then if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 4 and `a` must have a length greater than 5, otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 2 and `a` must have a length greater than 3**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `_` remains 0, `n` is still an integer greater than 0, and `a` is a string with a length greater than the current value of `i` + 2. The value of `s` is updated to be a substring of `a` with a length of 3 starting from the `i`-th character. The values of `ans` and `i` depend on the value of `s`. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 2 and `i` is 6, and `a` must have a length greater than 5. If `s` is not 'map' or 'pie', then if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 4, and `a` must have a length greater than 5, otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 2, and `a` must have a length greater than 3.
