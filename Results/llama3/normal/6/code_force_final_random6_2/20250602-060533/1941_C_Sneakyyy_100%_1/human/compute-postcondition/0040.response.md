Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string with a length of at least 7 if `i` is 5, `a` is a string with a length of at least 8 if `i` is 7 and `a` is a string with a length of at least 4 if `i` is 3, `s` is a substring of `a` with a length of 3 starting from index `i-1`, if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 2 and `i` is 7. If `s` is not 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 5 if the original `ans` was 1 and `i` was 4, otherwise `ans` is 0 and `i` is 3.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1. The length of string `a` is still dependent on the value of `i`. The substring `s` is now starting from index `i-1` instead of `i`. The conditions for `ans` and `i` are also updated accordingly.
