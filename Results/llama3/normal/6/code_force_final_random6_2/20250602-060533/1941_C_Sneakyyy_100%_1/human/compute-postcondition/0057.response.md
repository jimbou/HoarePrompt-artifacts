Output State: **_* is 2, n is an integer greater than 2, a is a string with length greater than i + 2, s is a substring of a starting at index i with length 3, i is equal to its original value plus 3, ans is equal to its original value plus 1, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `i` has increased by 3, and the value of `ans` has increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The length of string `a` is still greater than `i + 2`, and `s` is still a substring of `a` starting at index `i` with length 3. The value of `n` is still an integer greater than 2, and `_*` is still 2. Stdin remains empty.
