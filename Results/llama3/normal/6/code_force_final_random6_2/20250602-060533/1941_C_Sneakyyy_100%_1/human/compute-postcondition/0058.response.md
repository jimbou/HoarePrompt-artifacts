Output State: **_* is 2, n is an integer greater than 2, a is a string with length greater than i + 3, s is a substring of a starting at index i - 1 with length 3, i is less than len(a) - 1, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of i has been incremented by 1, so it is now one more than its previous value. The length of string a is still greater than i + 2, but since i has increased by 1, the length of a is now greater than i + 3. The substring s is still of length 3, but it now starts at index i - 1 instead of i, since i has been incremented. The other variables and stdin remain unchanged.
