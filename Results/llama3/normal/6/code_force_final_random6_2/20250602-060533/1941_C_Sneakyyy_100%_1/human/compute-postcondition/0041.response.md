Postcondition: **`_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string with a length of at least 7 if `i` is 4 or 5, `a` is a string with a length of at least 8 if `i` is 6 or 7 and `a` is a string with a length of at least 4 if `i` is 2 or 3, `s` is a substring of `a` with a length of 3 starting from index `i` or `i-1`, if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 3 and `i` is 9, or `ans` is 2 and `i` is 7, or `ans` is 2 and `i` is 6. If `s` is not 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 2 and `i` is 7 if the original `ans` was 1 and `i` was 3, or `ans` is 1 and `i` is 5, or `ans` is 1 and `i` is 4, otherwise `ans` is 1 and `i` is 5, or `ans` is 0 and `i` is 3, or `ans` is 0 and `i` is 2.**
