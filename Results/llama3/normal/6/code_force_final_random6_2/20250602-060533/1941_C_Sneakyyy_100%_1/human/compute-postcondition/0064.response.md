Postcondition: ***_ is 2, n is an integer greater than 2, a is a string with length greater than i + 2, s is a substring of a starting at index i with length 3, i is less than len(a), stdin is empty. If s is either 'map' or 'pie', then i is 3 more than its original value and ans is 3 more than its original value. Otherwise, s is a substring of a starting at index i-1 with length 3.***
