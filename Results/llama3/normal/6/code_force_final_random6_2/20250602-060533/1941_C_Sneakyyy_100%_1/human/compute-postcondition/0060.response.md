According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `len(a) - 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `len(a) - 2`, `a` is a string with length greater than `i + 2`. `a` being a string with length greater than `i + 2` does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `a` is a string with length greater than `i + 3`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **_*_ is 2, n is an integer greater than 2, a is a string with length greater than i + 3, s is a substring of a starting at index i - 1 with length 3, i is less than len(a) - 1, stdin is empty**
