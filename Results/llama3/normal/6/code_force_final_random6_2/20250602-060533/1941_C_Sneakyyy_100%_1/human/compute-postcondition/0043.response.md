Output State: `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string, `ans` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in `a`, `i` is `len(a)`, `stdin` is empty.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the value of `_` remains 1, `n` remains an integer, `a` remains a string, `ans` becomes the count of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in string `a`, `i` becomes equal to the length of string `a`, and `stdin` remains empty.
