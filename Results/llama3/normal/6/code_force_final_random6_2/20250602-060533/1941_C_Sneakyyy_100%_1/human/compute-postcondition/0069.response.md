Output State: **The loop variable `_` is equal to the integer `t` provided in the initial state, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a string, `ans` is the number of occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in `a`, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, and `stdin` is empty, and the number of occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in `a` which is `ans` is being printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that the loop has executed for the specified number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, it has processed the input string (`a`) to count the non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie'. The loop has finished executing all iterations, and the final count of occurrences is being printed.
