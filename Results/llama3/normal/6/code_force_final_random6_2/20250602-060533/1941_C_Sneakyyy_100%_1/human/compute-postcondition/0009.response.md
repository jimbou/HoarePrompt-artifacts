The variable in the loop head is i and a, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables i and a. If i is less than len(a) - 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is either 1 or 3, and a is a string with a length of at least 2. For the loop to execute again, i must be less than len(a) - 2. If i is 1, then len(a) - 2 must be greater than 1, which means len(a) must be greater than 3. If i is 3, then len(a) - 2 must be greater than 3, which means len(a) must be greater than 5. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **_ is 0, stdin is empty, n is an integer greater than 0, a is a string with a length of at least 2, s is a substring of a with a length of 3 starting from the first character. If s is either 'map' or 'pie', then ans is 1 and i is 3 and a must have a length greater than 5. Otherwise, ans is 0 and i is 1 and a must have a length greater than 3**
