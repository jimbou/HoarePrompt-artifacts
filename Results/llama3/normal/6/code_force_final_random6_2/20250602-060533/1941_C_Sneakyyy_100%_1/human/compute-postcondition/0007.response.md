The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` was 0, so the new value of `i` is 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin is still empty. The length of string `a` is still at least 2. The value of `ans` is still 0. The value of `n` is still an integer greater than 0. The value of `_` is still 0. The value of `s` is still a substring of `a` with a length of 3 starting from the first character. `s` is still not equal to 'map' and `s` is still not equal to 'pie'.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a string with a length of at least 2, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1, `s` is a substring of `a` with a length of 3 starting from the first character, `s` is not equal to 'map' and `s` is not equal to 'pie', stdin is empty.**
