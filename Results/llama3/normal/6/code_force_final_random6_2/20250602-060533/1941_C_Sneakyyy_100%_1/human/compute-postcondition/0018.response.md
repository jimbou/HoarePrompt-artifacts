Postcondition: **_ is 0, n is an integer greater than 0, a is a string with a length greater than the current value of i + 2, s is a substring of a with a length of 3 starting from the i-th character. If s is either 'map' or 'pie', then i is either 9 or 7 or 5 and ans is either 3 or 2 or 1. If s is not 'map' or 'pie', then if s is either 'map' or 'pie', then i is 7 and ans is 2 and a must have a length greater than 5. If s is not 'map' or 'pie', then if s is either 'map' or 'pie', then i is 5 and ans is 1 and a must have a length greater than 5, otherwise, i is 3 and ans is 0 and a must have a length greater than 3.**
