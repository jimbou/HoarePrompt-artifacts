Postcondition: **_ is 0, n is an integer greater than 0, a is a string with a length of at least 2, s is a substring of a with a length of 3 starting from the i-th character. If s is either 'map' or 'pie', then ans is 2 and i is 6 and a must have a length greater than 5. If s is not 'map' or 'pie', then if s is either 'map' or 'pie', then ans is 1 and i is 4 and a must have a length greater than 5, otherwise, ans is 0 and i is 2 and a must have a length greater than 3.**
