Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a string with a length of at least 2, `s` is a substring of `a` with a length of 3 starting from the `i`-th character, if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 3 and `a` must have a length greater than 5, otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 1 and `a` must have a length greater than 3.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to be a substring of `a` with a length of 3 starting from the `i`-th character. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions on `ans` and `i` are still dependent on the value of `s`, and the length of `a` is still constrained accordingly.
