Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It iterates over the input string, checking every substring of length 3. If the substring is 'map' or 'pie', it increments the counter and moves the index 3 positions forward. If the substring is not 'map' or 'pie', it moves the index 1 position forward. This approach ensures that all occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' are counted, and the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful is printed.

Correctness: **True**
