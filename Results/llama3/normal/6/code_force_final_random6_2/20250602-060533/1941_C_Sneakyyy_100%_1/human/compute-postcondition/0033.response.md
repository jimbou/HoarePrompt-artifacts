Output State: **_* is 1, n is an integer, a is a string with a length of at least 5, s is a substring of a with a length of 3, if s is either 'map' or 'pie', then ans is 1 and i is 3. Otherwise, ans is 0 and i is 1**

In this output state, the value of s is a substring of a with a length of 3, starting from the index i. The values of the other variables are not affected. The condition for ans and i remains the same, depending on the value of s.
