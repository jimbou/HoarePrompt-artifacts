To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The objects involved are `_` and `n` (where `n` is the value returned by `int(input())`).

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 1, and `n` is an integer.

For the loop to execute again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` needs to be greater than the current value of `_`.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `_` becomes 2
* `n` must be greater than 2

The other variables (`a`, `ans`, `i`, and `stdin`) are not involved in the loop head, so their states remain the same.

State: **`_` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` remains a string, `ans` remains the count of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in string `a`, `i` remains equal to the length of string `a`, and `stdin` remains empty**
