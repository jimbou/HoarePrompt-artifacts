To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The variables involved are `_` and `n` (which is the result of `int(input())`).

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 0, and `n` is an integer greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` needs to be greater than 1.

The other variables `stdin`, `a`, `ans`, and `i` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a string, `ans` is the number of times 'map' or 'pie' appears in `a` as a substring of length 3, and `i` is equal to the length of `a` - 2**
