The variable in the loop head is variable i and a, so we can only adjust those two. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables i and a.  If i is less than len(a) - 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is either 1 or 3 and a is a string with a length of at least 3. If i is 1, then a must be greater than or equal to 4 for the loop to execute again. If i is 3, then a must be greater than or equal to 5 for the loop to execute again. So for the loop to be executed one more time a must be greater than or equal to 5.
State: **_* is 1, n is an integer, a is a string with a length of at least 5, stdin is empty. If s is either 'map' or 'pie', then ans is 1 and i is 3. Otherwise, ans is 0 and i is 1**
