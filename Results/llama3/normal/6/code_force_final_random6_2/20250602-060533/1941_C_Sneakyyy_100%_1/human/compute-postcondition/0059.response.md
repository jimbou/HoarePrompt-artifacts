Postcondition: ***_* is 2, n is an integer greater than 2, a is a string with length greater than i + 2, s is a substring of a starting at index i with length 3, i is less than len(a) - 2, stdin is empty. If s is 'map' or 'pie', then i is equal to its original value plus 3 and ans is equal to its original value plus 1. Otherwise, a is a string with length greater than i + 3, s is a substring of a starting at index i - 1 with length 3, and i is less than len(a) - 1.***
