The code block consists of two lines. The first line increments the value of `i` by 3. Since `i` was initially 0, it becomes 3. The second line increments the value of `ans` by 1. Since `ans` was initially 0, it becomes 1.

No other variables are affected by the code block. The values of `_`, `n`, `a`, and `s` remain unchanged. The stdin remains empty.

Output State: **_ is 1, n is an integer, a is a string with a length of at least 3, ans is 1, i is 3, s is a string of length 3 and equals either 'map' or 'pie', stdin is empty**
