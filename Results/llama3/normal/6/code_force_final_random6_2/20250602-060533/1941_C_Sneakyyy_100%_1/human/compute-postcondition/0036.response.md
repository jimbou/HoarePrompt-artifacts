Postcondition: ***_* is 1, n is an integer, a is a string with a length of at least 5, s is a substring of a with a length of 3. If s is either 'map' or 'pie', then ans is 2 and i is 6. If s is not 'map' or 'pie', then ans is 1 and i is 4 if the original ans was 1 and i was 3, otherwise ans is 0 and i is 2.***
