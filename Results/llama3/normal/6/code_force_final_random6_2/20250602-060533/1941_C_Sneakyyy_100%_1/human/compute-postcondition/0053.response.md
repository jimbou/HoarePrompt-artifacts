The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` was 0, so the new value of `i` is 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **_ is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a string with length greater than 2, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1, `s` is a substring of `a` starting at index 0 with length 3, `stdin` is empty, and `s` is neither 'map' nor 'pie'.**
