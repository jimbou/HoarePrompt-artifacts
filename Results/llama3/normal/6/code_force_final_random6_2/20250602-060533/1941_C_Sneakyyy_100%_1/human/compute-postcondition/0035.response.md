Output State: **_* is 1, n is an integer, a is a string with a length of at least 5, s is a substring of a with a length of 3, if s is either 'map' or 'pie', then ans is 1 and i is 4. Otherwise, ans is 0 and i is 2**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is still 1 and `i` is now 4. Otherwise, `ans` is still 0 and `i` is now 2. The values of `_*`, `n`, `a`, and `s` are still the same as in the initial state.
