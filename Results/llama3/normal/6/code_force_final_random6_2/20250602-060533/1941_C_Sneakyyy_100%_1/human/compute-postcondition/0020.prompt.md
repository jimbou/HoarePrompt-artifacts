Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop variable _ is still 0, stdin is empty, n is an integer greater than 0, a is a string, ans is 0, i is 0
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a) - 2:
    s = a[i:i + 3]
    if s == 'map' or s == 'pie':
        i += 3
        ans += 1
    else:
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: _ is 0, stdin is empty, n is an integer greater than 0, a is a string with a length of at least 2, s is a substring of a with a length of 3 starting from the first character. If s is either 'map' or 'pie', then ans is 1 and i is 3. Otherwise, ans is 0 and i is 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: _ is 0, n is an integer greater than 0, a is a string with a length of at least 2, s is a substring of a with a length of 3 starting from the i-th character. If s is either 'map' or 'pie', then ans is 2 and i is 6 and a must have a length greater than 5. If s is not 'map' or 'pie', then if s is either 'map' or 'pie', then ans is 1 and i is 4 and a must have a length greater than 5, otherwise, ans is 0 and i is 2 and a must have a length greater than 3.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: _ is 0, n is an integer greater than 0, a is a string with a length greater than the current value of i + 2, s is a substring of a with a length of 3 starting from the i-th character. If s is either 'map' or 'pie', then i is either 9 or 7 or 5 and ans is either 3 or 2 or 1. If s is not 'map' or 'pie', then if s is either 'map' or 'pie', then i is 7 and ans is 2 and a must have a length greater than 5. If s is not 'map' or 'pie', then if s is either 'map' or 'pie', then i is 5 and ans is 1 and a must have a length greater than 5, otherwise, i is 3 and ans is 0 and a must have a length greater than 3.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
