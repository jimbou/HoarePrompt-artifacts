Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string with a length of at least 7 if `i` is 4, `a` is a string with a length of at least 8 if `i` is 6 and `a` is a string with a length of at least 4 if `i` is 2, `s` is a substring of `a` with a length of 3 starting from index `i`, if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 2 and `i` is 6. If `s` is not 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 4 if the original `ans` was 1 and `i` was 3, otherwise `ans` is 0 and `i` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to be a substring of `a` with a length of 3 starting from index `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `ans` and `i` are still dependent on the value of `s`, which is now a substring of `a` starting from index `i`.
