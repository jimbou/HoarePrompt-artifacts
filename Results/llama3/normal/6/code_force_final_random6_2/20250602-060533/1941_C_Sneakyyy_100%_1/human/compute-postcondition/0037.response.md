The variable in the loop head is i and a, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i and a.  If i is less than len(a) - 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is either 4, 6 or 2 and a is a string with a length of at least 5. For the loop to be executed one more time, a must be a string with a length of at least 7 if i is 4, a must be a string with a length of at least 8 if i is 6 and a must be a string with a length of at least 4 if i is 2.
State: **_*_ is 1, n is an integer, a is a string with a length of at least 7 if i is 4, a is a string with a length of at least 8 if i is 6 and a is a string with a length of at least 4 if i is 2, s is a substring of a with a length of 3. If s is either 'map' or 'pie', then ans is 2 and i is 6. If s is not 'map' or 'pie', then ans is 1 and i is 4 if the original ans was 1 and i was 3, otherwise ans is 0 and i is 2.**
