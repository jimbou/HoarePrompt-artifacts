#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers, num2 is an integer representing the length of the list a, 2 <= num2 <= 100, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for all i.
    order = 0
    for i in range(1, num2):
        if a[i - 1] >= a[i]:
            order += 1
        
    #State: `a` is a list of integers, `num2` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is equal to `num2`, and `order` is the total number of pairs of adjacent elements in `a` where the first element is greater than or equal to the second element.
    if (order == 0) :
        return True
        #The program returns True, indicating that there are no pairs of adjacent elements in list `a` where the first element is greater than or equal to the second element, and the value of `i` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, specifically equal to `num2`.
    else :
        return False
        #The program returns False

#Overall this is what the function does:This function checks if a given list of integers is strictly increasing, meaning that each element is greater than the previous one. It accepts a list of integers and its length as input, and returns True if the list is strictly increasing, and False otherwise. The function does not modify the input list.
