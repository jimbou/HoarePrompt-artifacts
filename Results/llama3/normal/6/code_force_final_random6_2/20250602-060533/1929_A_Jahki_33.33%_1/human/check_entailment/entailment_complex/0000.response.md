Reasoning:

The given program is designed to calculate the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of an array is defined as the sum of the differences between adjacent elements.

The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array elements. It then checks if the array is already in strictly increasing order using the `func_1` function. If the array is already in strictly increasing order, it prints 0 as the beauty. Otherwise, it sorts the array in ascending order and calculates the beauty by summing the differences between adjacent elements.

The `func_1` function checks if the array is strictly increasing by iterating through the array and checking if each element is greater than the previous one. If it finds a pair of adjacent elements where the first element is not greater than the second element, it returns False. If it iterates through the entire array without finding such a pair, it returns True.

The program's logic is correct. If the array is already in strictly increasing order, its beauty is indeed 0. If the array is not in strictly increasing order, sorting it in ascending order will maximize its beauty, and the program correctly calculates this maximum beauty.

However, there is a small issue with the program. The `func_1` function is not necessary, and the program can be simplified by removing it. The program can directly sort the array and calculate its beauty, regardless of whether it is already in strictly increasing order or not. This is because the beauty of an array is maximized when it is in strictly increasing order, and sorting the array will always result in a strictly increasing order.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is True, but it can be improved by removing the unnecessary `func_1` function.

Correctness: **True**
