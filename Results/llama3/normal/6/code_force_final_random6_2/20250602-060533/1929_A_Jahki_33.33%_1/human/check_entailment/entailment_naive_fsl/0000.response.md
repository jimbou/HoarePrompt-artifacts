Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input array has duplicate elements. In such cases, the function `func_1` will return `True` even if the array is not already sorted in ascending order, because it only checks if each element is greater than or equal to the previous one, but does not check if they are equal. As a result, the program will print `0` instead of the correct maximum beauty.

For example, if the input array is `[2, 2, 3]`, the program will print `0` instead of `1`, which is the correct maximum beauty.
