Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array elements. It then checks if the array is already in strictly increasing order using the `func_1` function. If it is, the program prints 0, indicating that no rearrangement is needed to achieve the maximum beauty. If the array is not in strictly increasing order, the program sorts the array in ascending order and calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements.

The program's logic is correct, and it follows the problem description accurately. The `func_1` function correctly checks if the array is strictly increasing, and the main program correctly calculates the maximum beauty by sorting the array and summing the differences.

However, there is a minor issue with the program. The `func_1` function is not necessary, as the program can simply sort the array and calculate the beauty without checking if the array is already in strictly increasing order. The `func_1` function is redundant and can be removed.

Despite this minor issue, the program's logic is correct, and it produces the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
