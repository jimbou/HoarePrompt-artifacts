The code increments the value of `order` by 1. The initial state does not specify the value of `order`, so we can only say that its value is increased by 1. The values of `a`, `num2`, and `i` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `num2` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `order` is increased by 1**
