Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `num2` is an integer representing the length of the list `a`, `2 <= num2 <= 100`, `1 <= a_i <= 10^9` for all `i`, and `order` is 0.**

In this output state, the code has introduced a new variable `order` and assigned it the value 0. The values of the other variables, `a` and `num2`, remain unchanged. The length of the list `a` is still represented by `num2`, and the elements of `a` are still integers within the range of 1 to 10^9.
