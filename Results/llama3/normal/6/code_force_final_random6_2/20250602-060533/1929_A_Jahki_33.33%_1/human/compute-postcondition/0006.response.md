Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `num2` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `order` is either 1 or 2**

The code increments the value of `order` by 1. Since `order` was initially either 0 or 1, its new value is either 1 or 2. The values of the other variables, `a`, `num2`, and `i`, remain unchanged.
