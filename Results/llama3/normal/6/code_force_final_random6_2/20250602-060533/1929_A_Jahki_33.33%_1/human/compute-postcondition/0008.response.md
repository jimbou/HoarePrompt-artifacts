To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to continue.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, num2):`, which means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `num2`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `num2` is an integer greater than 2.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. Additionally, `num2` must still be greater than the new value of `i`, which is 3.

The other variables, `a` and `order`, are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`a` is a list of integers, `num2` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3**
