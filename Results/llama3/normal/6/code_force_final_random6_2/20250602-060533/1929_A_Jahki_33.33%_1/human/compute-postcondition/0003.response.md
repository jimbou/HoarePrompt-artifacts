Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `num2` is an integer greater than 1, `order` is 1, and `i` is 1. The current value of `i` is 1, and the current value of `a[i - 1]` is greater than or equal to the current value of `a[i]`.**

In this output state, the value of `order` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `order` being 1. The values of `a`, `num2`, and `i` remain unchanged. The relationship between `a[i - 1]` and `a[i]` also remains the same, with `a[i - 1]` being greater than or equal to `a[i]`.
