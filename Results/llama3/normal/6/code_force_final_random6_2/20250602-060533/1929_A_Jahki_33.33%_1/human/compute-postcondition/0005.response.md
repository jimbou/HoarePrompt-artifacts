To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the variables in the loop head according to the loop condition.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, num2):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `num2`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `num2` is greater than 1.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `num2` remains the same, but since `i` is now 2, `num2` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables `a`, `order` are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`a` is a list of integers, `num2` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `order` is either 0 or 1**
