Reasoning:

The problem requires finding a permutation of length n such that there do not exist two distinct indices i and j (1 ≤ i, j < n; i ≠ j) such that p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}.

The given program defines a function func_1() that takes an integer input, generates a list of integers from 1 to the input integer, reverses all odd-indexed elements in the list, and prints the resulting list.

The program's approach is to create a list of integers from 1 to n and then reverse the odd-indexed elements. This ensures that no two consecutive elements in the list have a divisor relationship, satisfying the problem's condition.

The execution summary confirms that the program reverses all odd-indexed elements in the list and prints the resulting list, which aligns with the program's intended behavior.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution summary, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
