Reasoning: 
The given program is incorrect because it only checks if the value of b is even or odd, but it does not consider the value of a. According to the problem description, Bob can cut the rectangle into two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides of the original rectangle. This means that the program should also check if the value of a is even or odd, not just the value of b.

Correctness: **False**
