Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The function `func_1(a, b)` only checks if `b` is even, and returns 'yes' if it is, and 'no' if it's not. However, this does not accurately solve the problem.

The problem requires determining if it's possible to cut a rectangle of size `a x b` into two rectangles with integer sides, and then form a different rectangle from those two rectangles. The function `func_1(a, b)` does not take into account the value of `a`, and only checks if `b` is even. This is not sufficient to solve the problem.

For example, if `a = 3` and `b = 2`, the function will return 'no', but it's actually possible to cut the rectangle into two `3 x 1` rectangles and then form a `1 x 6` rectangle, which is different from the original rectangle.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
