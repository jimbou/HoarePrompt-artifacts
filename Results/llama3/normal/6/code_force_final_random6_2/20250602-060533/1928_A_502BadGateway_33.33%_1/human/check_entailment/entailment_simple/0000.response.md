Reasoning: 

The given program is incorrect. The function `func_1(a, b)` only checks if `b` is even, and returns 'yes' if it is, and 'no' otherwise. However, this is not a sufficient condition to determine if another rectangle can be formed.

For example, if `a` is 3 and `b` is 2, the function will return 'no', but another rectangle can actually be formed by cutting the 3x2 rectangle into two 3x1 rectangles and then forming a 1x6 rectangle.

Similarly, if `a` is 2 and `b` is 4, the function will return 'yes', but another rectangle cannot be formed because the 2x4 rectangle can only be cut into two 2x2 rectangles, and from these, only the 2x4 and 4x2 rectangles can be formed, which are considered the same.

A correct solution would need to consider both `a` and `b`, and check if the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b` is greater than 1, or if `a` and `b` are both even.

Correctness: **False**
