#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
    return 'yes' if b % 2 == 0 else 'no'
    #The program returns 'yes' if b is an even integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), otherwise it returns 'no'.

#Overall this is what the function does:Determines whether a given integer b is even or odd, returning 'yes' if it's even and 'no' if it's odd, considering b is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive).
