Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when the input is 3 2, the program outputs 'no', but according to the problem description, the 3 x 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 x 1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 x 6 rectangle can be formed, which is a different rectangle. Therefore, the correct output should be 'yes'.

The issue with the program is that it only checks if the width (b) is even, but it does not consider the case where the length (a) is even or where the rectangle can be cut into two rectangles with different dimensions. The program needs to be modified to handle these cases correctly.
