Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer and k is greater than the original tickets_bought plus min(m, k - tickets_bought), prices is a list of n positive integers, pq is a min-heap of tuples containing a price and its index in prices, total_cost is the original total_cost plus the product of the popped price plus price_increase and min(m, k - tickets_bought), tickets_bought is the original tickets_bought plus min(m, k - tickets_bought) and tickets_bought is less than k, price_increase is the original price_increase plus min(m, k - tickets_bought).**

The code snippet modifies the values of `total_cost`, `tickets_bought`, and `price_increase`. The first line removes the tuple with the smallest price from the min-heap `pq` and assigns it to `price` and `day`. The second line increments the `price` by the `price_increase`. The third line calculates the number of tickets to buy, which is the minimum of `m` and `k - tickets_bought`. The fourth line adds the product of the updated `price` and `tickets_to_buy` to `total_cost`. The fifth line increments `tickets_bought` by `tickets_to_buy`. The sixth line increments `price_increase` by `tickets_to_buy`.
