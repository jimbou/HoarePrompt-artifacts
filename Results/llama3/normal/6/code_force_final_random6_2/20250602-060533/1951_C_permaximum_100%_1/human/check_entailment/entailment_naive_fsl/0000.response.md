Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in the case where the number of tickets to be bought (k) is greater than the number of days (n) times the maximum number of tickets that can be bought per day (m). In this case, the program will try to buy more tickets than are available, which is not possible.

For example, if n = 3, m = 2, and k = 7, the program will try to buy 7 tickets, but it is only possible to buy 6 tickets (2 tickets per day for 3 days). The program will not handle this case correctly and will produce an incorrect result.

The program should check if k is greater than n * m and handle this case separately, for example by returning an error message or by adjusting the number of tickets to be bought to the maximum possible value.
