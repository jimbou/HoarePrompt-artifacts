Functionality: **Calculates the total cost of buying a specified number of tickets with increasing prices.**

The function accepts parameters: n (number of days), m (number of tickets that can be bought per day), k (total number of tickets to buy), and prices (a list of prices for each day).

The function returns the total cost of buying k tickets, considering that the price increases after each purchase. The price increase is proportional to the number of tickets bought.

The function's purpose is to simulate a ticket-buying scenario where the price increases as more tickets are bought, and it calculates the total cost of buying a specified number of tickets.
