Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer and k is greater than the original tickets_bought plus min(m, k - tickets_bought), prices is a list of n positive integers, pq is a min-heap of tuples containing a price and its index in prices, total_cost is the original total_cost plus the product of the popped price plus price_increase and min(m, k - tickets_bought), tickets_bought is the original tickets_bought plus min(m, k - tickets_bought), price_increase is the original price_increase plus min(m, k - tickets_bought).**

In this output state, the values of n, m, and k remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The list of prices and the min-heap pq also remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The total_cost is incremented by the product of the popped price plus price_increase and min(m, k - tickets_bought). The tickets_bought is incremented by min(m, k - tickets_bought). The price_increase is incremented by min(m, k - tickets_bought).
