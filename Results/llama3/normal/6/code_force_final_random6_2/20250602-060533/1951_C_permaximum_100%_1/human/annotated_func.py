    #State: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, prices is a list of n positive integers, pq is a min-heap of tuples containing a price and its index in prices, total_cost is the original total_cost plus the sum of the products of the popped price plus price_increase and min(m, k - tickets_bought) for all iterations, tickets_bought is equal to k, price_increase is the original price_increase plus the sum of min(m, k - tickets_bought) for all iterations.
    return total_cost
    #The program returns the total cost which is the original total cost plus the sum of the products of the popped price plus price increase and min(m, k - tickets_bought) for all iterations, where m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, tickets_bought is equal to k, and price_increase is the original price_increase plus the sum of min(m, k - tickets_bought) for all iterations.

#Overall this is what the function does:Calculates the total cost of buying a specified number of tickets with increasing prices.
