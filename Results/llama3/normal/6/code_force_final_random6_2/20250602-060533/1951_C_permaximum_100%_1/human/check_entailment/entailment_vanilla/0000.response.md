Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum spending to purchase k tickets, given the constraints of the problem. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases t, and then for each test case, it reads the number of sale days n, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day m, and the number of tickets to be bought k.

2. It then reads the prices of the tickets for each day and stores them in the list prices.

3. The program defines a function func_1 that takes n, m, k, and prices as input and returns the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

4. Inside the function func_1, it creates a priority queue pq using the prices and their corresponding days. The priority queue is a min-heap, meaning the ticket with the lowest price will be at the top of the heap.

5. The function then initializes variables total_cost to keep track of the total cost, tickets_bought to keep track of the number of tickets bought, and price_increase to keep track of the increase in price due to buying tickets.

6. The function enters a while loop that continues until all k tickets have been bought.

7. Inside the loop, it pops the ticket with the lowest price from the priority queue, adds the price increase to the price, and calculates the number of tickets to buy on the current day. The number of tickets to buy is the minimum of m and the remaining tickets to be bought (k - tickets_bought).

8. It then updates the total cost by adding the cost of the tickets bought on the current day, updates the number of tickets bought, and updates the price increase.

9. Once all k tickets have been bought, the function returns the total cost.

10. The main program prints the result of the function func_1 for each test case.

The program correctly implements the greedy algorithm to solve the problem. It always chooses the ticket with the lowest price and buys as many tickets as possible on the current day, which minimizes the total cost.

Correctness: **True**
