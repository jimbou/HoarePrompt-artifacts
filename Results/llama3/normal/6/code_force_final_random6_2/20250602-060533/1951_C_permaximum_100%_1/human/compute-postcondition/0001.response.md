To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to examine the loop condition: `tickets_bought < k`.

Given the state right before the loop:

- `n` is a positive integer
- `m` is a positive integer
- `k` is a positive integer
- `prices` is a list of `n` positive integers
- `pq` is a min-heap of tuples containing a price and its index in `prices`
- `total_cost` is 0
- `tickets_bought` is 0
- `price_increase` is 0

The loop condition depends on the values of `tickets_bought` and `k`. Since `tickets_bought` is 0, to ensure the loop can execute at least once, `k` must be greater than 0. However, `k` is already stated to be a positive integer, which inherently means it is greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to the state of `k` or any other variables for the loop to execute the first time, as the condition is already satisfied with the given states.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `prices` is a list of `n` positive integers, `pq` is a min-heap of tuples containing a price and its index in `prices`, `total_cost` is 0, `tickets_bought` is 0, `price_increase` is 0**
