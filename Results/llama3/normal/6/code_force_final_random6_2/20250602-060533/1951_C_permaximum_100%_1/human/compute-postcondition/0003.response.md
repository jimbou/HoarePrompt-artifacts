The variable in the loop head is variable tickets_bought and k, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable tickets_bought and k.  If tickets_bought is less than k, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, tickets_bought is the original tickets_bought plus min(m, k - tickets_bought) and k is a positive integer, So for the loop to be executed one more time k needed to have been greater than the original tickets_bought plus min(m, k - tickets_bought).
State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer and k is greater than the original tickets_bought plus min(m, k - tickets_bought), prices is a list of n positive integers, pq is a min-heap of tuples containing a price and its index in prices, total_cost is the original total_cost plus the product of the popped price plus price_increase and min(m, k - tickets_bought), tickets_bought is the original tickets_bought plus min(m, k - tickets_bought), price_increase is the original price_increase plus min(m, k - tickets_bought)**
