Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It uses a priority queue to keep track of the cheapest ticket prices and buys as many tickets as possible on the cheapest days. The `price_increase` variable is used to keep track of the increase in price due to buying tickets on previous days.

The program correctly handles the case where the number of tickets to buy is less than the maximum number of tickets that can be bought on a day. It also correctly handles the case where the number of tickets to buy is more than the maximum number of tickets that can be bought on a day, by buying as many tickets as possible on the cheapest days and then buying the remaining tickets on the next cheapest days.

The program also correctly calculates the total cost by adding the cost of the tickets bought on each day to the total cost.

Therefore, the program is correct and will produce the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Correctness: **True**
