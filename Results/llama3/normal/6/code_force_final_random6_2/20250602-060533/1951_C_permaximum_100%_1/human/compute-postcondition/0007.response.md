Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, prices is a list of n positive integers, pq is a min-heap of tuples containing a price and its index in prices, total_cost is the original total_cost plus the sum of the products of the popped price plus price_increase and min(m, k - tickets_bought) for all iterations, tickets_bought is equal to k, price_increase is the original price_increase plus the sum of min(m, k - tickets_bought) for all iterations.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is:

* n, m, and k remain positive integers.
* prices remains a list of n positive integers.
* pq remains a min-heap of tuples containing a price and its index in prices.
* total_cost is the sum of the original total_cost and the products of the popped price plus price_increase and min(m, k - tickets_bought) for all iterations.
* tickets_bought is equal to k, indicating that the loop has executed enough times to buy k tickets.
* price_increase is the sum of the original price_increase and the sum of min(m, k - tickets_bought) for all iterations, reflecting the cumulative increase in price due to the loop's iterations.
