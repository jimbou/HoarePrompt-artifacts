Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly initializes a min-heap `pq` with the prices and their indices. This allows it to efficiently select the day with the lowest price.

2. The program correctly calculates the number of tickets to buy on each day, which is the minimum of `m` (the maximum number of tickets that can be bought per day) and `k - tickets_bought` (the remaining number of tickets to buy).

3. The program correctly updates the total cost by adding the product of the price and the number of tickets bought.

4. The program correctly updates the `price_increase` variable, which keeps track of the total increase in price due to the tickets bought so far.

5. The program correctly terminates when `tickets_bought` reaches `k`, which means all the required tickets have been bought.

6. The program correctly returns the total cost, which is the sum of the costs of all the tickets bought.

Therefore, the program correctly calculates the minimum spending to purchase `k` tickets.

Correctness: **True**
