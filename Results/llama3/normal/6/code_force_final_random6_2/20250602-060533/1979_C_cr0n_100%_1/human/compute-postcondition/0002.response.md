Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `vals` is a list of integers greater than 1 that must have at least 1 integer, `x` is the first integer in `vals`, `den` is the result of `func_1(den, x)`, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `den` has been updated to be the result of the function `func_1` called with the original value of `den` (which is equal to `x`) and `x` as arguments. The values of `N`, `vals`, and `x` remain unchanged. The stdin remains empty.
