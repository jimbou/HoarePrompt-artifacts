Output State: **N is a positive integer, vals is an empty list, x is the last integer in the initial vals, den is the result of func_1 applied to the initial den and each integer in the initial vals in order, stdin is empty**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same positive integer value for N, an empty list for vals (since all elements have been processed), the last integer from the initial vals list as the value for x, and the result of applying func_1 to the initial denominator and each integer in the initial vals list in order as the value for den. The stdin remains empty as it was not affected by the loop.
