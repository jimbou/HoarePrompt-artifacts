Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The problem requires determining how to distribute coins among different outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Function `func_1` calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two positive integers, which is used in `func_2` to calculate the LCM of a list of integers.

Function `func_2` calculates the LCM of the list of integers, then subtracts the sum of the quotients of the LCM divided by each integer. If the result is positive, it prints the quotients; otherwise, it prints -1 and returns None.

The logic of `func_2` is correct because it ensures that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. This is achieved by subtracting the sum of the quotients from the LCM, which guarantees that the total amount of coins bet is less than the LCM.

The execution summaries of the functions also support this reasoning. The output hints for `func_1` indicate that it correctly calculates the LCM of two positive integers, and the output hints for `func_2` indicate that it correctly calculates the LCM of a list of integers and prints the quotients if the result is positive.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution summaries of the functions, the given program is correct.
