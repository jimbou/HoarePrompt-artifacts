To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head and how it changes from one iteration to the next.

The loop head is `for x in vals:`, which means we're iterating over the elements of the list `vals`. The variable `x` takes on the value of each element in `vals` in each iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

* `N` is a positive integer (no change needed)
* `vals` is a list of integers greater than 1 that must have at least 1 integer (no change needed)
* `x` is the first integer in `vals` (will change to the next integer in `vals`)
* `den` is the result of `func_1(den, x)` (no change needed, as it's not part of the loop head)
* `stdin` is empty (no change needed)

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to consider what happens to `x` and `vals`. Since `x` is the first integer in `vals` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `vals` must have at least two integers, and `x` should become the second integer in `vals`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `vals` is a list of integers greater than 1 that must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in `vals`, `den` is the result of `func_1(den, x)`, `stdin` is empty**
