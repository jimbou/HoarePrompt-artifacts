Output State: **N is a positive integer equal to the number of integers in the input, vals is a list of integers greater than 1, den is the first integer in vals, stdin is empty**

In this final state, N is a positive integer equal to the number of integers in the input, vals is a list of integers greater than 1, den is the first integer in vals, and stdin is empty. The code first reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to N, then reads a list of integers from stdin and assigns it to vals. The third line assigns the first integer in vals to den. Since vals contains integers greater than 1, den is also greater than 1. The stdin is empty after the code execution because all the inputs have been read.
