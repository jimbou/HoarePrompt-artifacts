Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `vals` is a list of integers greater than 1 that must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in `vals`, `den` is the result of `func_1(func_1(den, x), x)`, `stdin` is empty**

In this output state, the value of `den` has been updated to be the result of calling `func_1` with the previous value of `den` and `x` as arguments, and then calling `func_1` again with the result and `x` as arguments. The other variables remain unchanged.
