Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `vals` is a list of integers greater than 1 that must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in `vals`, `den` is the result of `func_1(func_1(func_1(den, x), x), x)`, `stdin` is empty**

In this output state, the value of `den` has been updated to be the result of `func_1(func_1(func_1(den, x), x), x)`, which is a nested application of the `func_1` function to the previous value of `den` and the value of `x`. The other variables, `N`, `vals`, and `x`, remain unchanged, and `stdin` is still empty.
