Output State: **N is a positive integer, vals is an empty list, x is the last integer in the initial vals, den is the result of func_1 applied to the initial den and each integer in the initial vals in order, minus the sum of the quotients of den divided by each integer in the initial vals.**

Explanation:
The first line creates a list `vprod` containing the quotients of `den` divided by each integer in `vals`. Since `vals` is an empty list, `vprod` will also be an empty list. The second line subtracts the sum of `vprod` from `den`. Since `vprod` is an empty list, the sum will be 0, and `den` will remain unchanged. Therefore, the final state of the variables is the same as the initial state, with the exception of `den`, which is updated to be the result of `func_1` applied to the initial `den` and each integer in the initial `vals` in order, minus the sum of the quotients of `den` divided by each integer in the initial `vals`.
