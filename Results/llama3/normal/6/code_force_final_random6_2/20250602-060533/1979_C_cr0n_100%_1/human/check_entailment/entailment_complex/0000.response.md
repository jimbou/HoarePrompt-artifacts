Reasoning:

The problem requires determining how to distribute coins among different outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Function 1 calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two positive integers, which is used in Function 2 to find the LCM of a list of integers.

Function 2 first calculates the LCM of the list of integers using Function 1. Then, it calculates the sum of the quotients of the LCM divided by each integer in the list. If the result is positive, it prints the quotients; otherwise, it prints -1 and returns None.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic required by the problem. The LCM of the list of integers represents the total amount of coins that would be received back for each possible winning outcome. The sum of the quotients of the LCM divided by each integer represents the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes. If the result is positive, it means that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome, which meets the problem's requirement.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
