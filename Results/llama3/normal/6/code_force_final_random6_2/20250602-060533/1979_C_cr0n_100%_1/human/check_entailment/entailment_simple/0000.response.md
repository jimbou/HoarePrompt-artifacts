Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem where you need to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. The program uses the concept of least common multiple (LCM) to find the optimal distribution of coins.

The program first reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the number of outcomes and the multipliers for each outcome. It then calculates the LCM of all the multipliers using the `func_1` function.

The program then calculates the product of the LCM and each multiplier, and subtracts the sum of these products from the LCM. If the result is less than or equal to 0, it means that there is no way to distribute the coins as required, and the program prints -1.

If the result is greater than 0, it means that there is a way to distribute the coins, and the program prints the products of the LCM and each multiplier.

The program is correct because it correctly calculates the LCM of the multipliers and uses it to find the optimal distribution of coins. The program also correctly handles the case where there is no way to distribute the coins as required.

Correctness: **True**
