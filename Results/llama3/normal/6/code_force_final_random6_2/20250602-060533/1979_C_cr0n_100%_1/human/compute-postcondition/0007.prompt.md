Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: N is a positive integer equal to the number of integers in the input, vals is a list of integers greater than 1, den is the first integer in vals, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for x in vals:
    den = func_1(den, x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `N` is a positive integer, `vals` is a list of integers greater than 1 that must have at least 1 integer, `x` is the first integer in `vals`, `den` is the result of `func_1(den, x)`, stdin is empty

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `N` is a positive integer, `vals` is a list of integers greater than 1 that must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in `vals`, `den` is the result of `func_1(func_1(den, x), x)`, `stdin` is empty

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `N` is a positive integer, `vals` is a list of integers greater than 1 that must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in `vals`, `den` is the result of `func_1(func_1(func_1(den, x), x), x)`, `stdin` is empty




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
