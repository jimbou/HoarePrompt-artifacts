Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program is designed to solve the problem of distributing coins in a game with n possible outcomes, where each outcome has a multiplier k_i. The goal is to distribute the coins such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program uses two functions: `func_1` calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers using the formula `a * b // gcd(a, b)`, and `func_2` solves the main problem.

In `func_2`, the program first reads the number of outcomes N and the multipliers vals. It then calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all the multipliers using `func_1`. The LCM is used to calculate the product of each multiplier and the LCM, which represents the amount of coins that would be received back for each outcome if it wins.

The program then calculates the sum of these products and subtracts it from the LCM to get the remaining amount of coins that can be distributed. If this remaining amount is less than or equal to 0, the program prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required.

Otherwise, the program prints the products of each multiplier and the LCM, which represent the amounts of coins that should be bet on each outcome.

The program works correctly for all possible inputs because it correctly calculates the LCM of the multipliers and uses it to determine the amounts of coins that should be bet on each outcome. The program also correctly handles the case where there is no way to distribute the coins as required, printing -1 in this case.

Therefore, the program is correct, and the Correctness is **True**.
