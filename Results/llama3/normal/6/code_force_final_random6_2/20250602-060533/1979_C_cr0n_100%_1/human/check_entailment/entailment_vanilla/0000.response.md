Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of distributing coins among different outcomes in a game such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first reads the number of outcomes (N) and the multipliers for each outcome (vals).

2. It then calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all the multipliers using the `func_1` function. This LCM represents the total amount of coins that would be received back if any of the outcomes were to win.

3. The program then calculates the product of the LCM and each multiplier, and stores these products in the `vprod` list. These products represent the amount of coins that would be bet on each outcome.

4. The program then calculates the difference between the LCM and the sum of the products in `vprod`. This difference represents the amount of coins that would be left over after betting on all outcomes.

5. If the difference is less than or equal to 0, the program prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required.

6. Otherwise, the program prints the products in `vprod`, which represent the amount of coins to bet on each outcome.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
