The only objects in the loop head are variables  x and list  vals, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the vals.  If the list has at least 3 integers the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, vals has at least 2 integers, x is the second integer in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 integers and the x is the third integer in the list.
State: **`N` is a positive integer, `vals` is a list of integers greater than 1 that must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in `vals`, `den` is the result of `func_1(func_1(den, x), x)`, `stdin` is empty**
