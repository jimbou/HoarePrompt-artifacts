Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n*(n-1)` modulo `M`, `s` is `k*(k-1)*c*i*c*m + k*c*a`, `a` is `m*f`, `i` is `k-1`, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `stdin` contains no test cases**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is as follows:

The variables `n`, `m`, `M`, `c`, `a`, `u`, `v`, `f`, and `stdin` remain unchanged from their initial states. The variable `k` is still an integer, but its value is now equal to the number of iterations of the loop. The variable `s` has been updated to be the sum of the products of `c`, `i`, `c`, `m`, and `c`, `a` for each iteration of the loop. The variable `i` has been updated to be `k-1`, which is the last value it took on during the loop's execution.
