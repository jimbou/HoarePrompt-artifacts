Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of the number of children (n), the number of pairs of friends (m), and the number of excursions (k).

2. It calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of n*(n-1) modulo 10^9 + 7, which is used to calculate the probability of choosing a pair of friends in each excursion.

3. It calculates the sum of the friendship values of all pairs of friends (a).

4. It calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions (s). This is done by summing up the product of the probability of choosing a pair of friends in each excursion and the sum of the friendship values of all pairs of friends.

5. Finally, it prints the remainder of s divided by 10^9 + 7 for each test case, which is the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions modulo 10^9 + 7.

The program correctly implements the mathematical formula for the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions, and it handles the modulo operation correctly.

Correctness: **True**
