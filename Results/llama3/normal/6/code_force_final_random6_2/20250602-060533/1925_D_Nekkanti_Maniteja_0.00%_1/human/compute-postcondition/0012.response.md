Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n*(n-1)` modulo `M`, `s` is `c * a + c * c * m * i + c * i * c * m + c * a`, `a` is the original value of `a` plus `m` times the value of `f`, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `m` test cases**

The value of `s` is updated by adding `c * i * c * m + c * a` to its original value. The other variables remain unchanged. The new value of `s` can be simplified to `2 * c * a + c * c * m * i + c * i * c * m`, which is a combination of the original value of `s` and the additional terms. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus `m` test cases.
