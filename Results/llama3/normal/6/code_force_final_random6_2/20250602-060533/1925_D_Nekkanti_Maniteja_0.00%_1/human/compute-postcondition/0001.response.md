Output State: **i is 0, n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, M is 1000000007, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n*(n-1) modulo M, s is 0, a is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case**

In this output state, the value of `i` remains unchanged at 0. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned integer values from the first line of the input in stdin, which contains multiple test cases. The variable `M` is assigned the value of 1000000007. The variable `c` is assigned the modular multiplicative inverse of `n*(n-1)` modulo `M`. The variables `s` and `a` are initialized to 0. After executing the code, stdin contains one less test case than initially.
