Output State: **`i` is `k`, `k` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n*(n-1)` modulo `M`, `s` is `c * (m-1) * c * m + c * a + c * m * c * m + c * a + ... + c * (k-1) * c * m + c * a`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer, stdin contains no test cases**

The output state after the loop executes all iterations is characterized by the variable `i` being equal to `k`, indicating that the loop has completed `k` iterations. The values of `n`, `m`, `M`, `c`, `a`, `u`, `v`, and `f` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop. The value of `s` is the cumulative sum of the terms `c * i * c * m + c * a` for all iterations, where `i` ranges from `m-1` to `k-1`.
