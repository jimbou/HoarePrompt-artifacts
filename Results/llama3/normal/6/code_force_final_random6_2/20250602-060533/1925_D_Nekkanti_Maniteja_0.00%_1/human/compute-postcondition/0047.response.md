The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `k` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n*(n-1)` modulo `M`, `s` is `c * i * c * m + c * a`, `a` is `m*f`, `i` is 1, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `stdin` contains no test cases**
