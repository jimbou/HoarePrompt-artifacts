stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains an integer t, followed by t sets of inputs. Each set of inputs contains an integer k, followed by k lines of input. Each line of input contains three integers: n, m, and k, followed by m lines of input, each containing three integers: a_i, b_i, and f_i.
