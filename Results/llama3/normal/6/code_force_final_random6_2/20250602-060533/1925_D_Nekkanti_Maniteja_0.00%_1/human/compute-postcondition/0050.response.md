Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 2, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n*(n-1)` modulo `M`, `s` is `4*c*i*c*m + 3*c*a`, `a` is `m*f`, `i` is 2, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `stdin` contains no test cases**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to `4*c*i*c*m + 3*c*a` by adding `c * i * c * m + c * a` to its previous value. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
