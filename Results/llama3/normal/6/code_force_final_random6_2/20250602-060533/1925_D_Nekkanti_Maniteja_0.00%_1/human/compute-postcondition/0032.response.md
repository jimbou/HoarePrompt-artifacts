Output State: **`i` is `m+1`, `k` is an integer greater than `m+1`, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n*(n-1)` modulo `M`, `s` is `c * (m-1) * c * m + c * a + c * m * c * m + c * a + c * (m+1) * c * m + c * a`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer, stdin contains no test cases**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated by adding `c * i * c * m + c * a` to its previous value. Since `i` is `m+1`, the new value of `s` can be expressed as `c * (m-1) * c * m + c * a + c * m * c * m + c * a + c * (m+1) * c * m + c * a`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
