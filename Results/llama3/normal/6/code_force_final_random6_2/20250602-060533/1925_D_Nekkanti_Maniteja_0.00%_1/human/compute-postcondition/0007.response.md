Output State: **i is 2, n is an integer, m is at least 2, k is an integer, M is 1000000007, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n*(n-1) modulo M, s is 0, a is the original value of a plus 2 times the value of f, u is an integer, v is an integer, f is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases**

In this output state, the values of `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c`, and `s` remain unchanged. The value of `a` is updated by adding the value of `f` to its original value, and then adding the new value of `f` again, effectively doubling the value of `f` and adding it to the original value of `a`. The values of `u`, `v`, and `f` are updated to the values read from the input. The number of test cases in `stdin` is reduced by three.
