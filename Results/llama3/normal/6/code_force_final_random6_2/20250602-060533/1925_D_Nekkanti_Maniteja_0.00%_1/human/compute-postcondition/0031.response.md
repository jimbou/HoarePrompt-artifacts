The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and k, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `m`, `k` is greater than `m`. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is `m+1` and for the loop to execute again `k` must be greater than `m+1`.
State: **`i` is `m+1`, `k` is an integer greater than `m+1`, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n*(n-1)` modulo `M`, `s` is `c * (m-1) * c * m + c * a + c * m * c * m + c * a`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer, stdin contains no test cases**
