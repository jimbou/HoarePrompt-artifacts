Output: **`i` is `k-1`, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n*(n-1)` modulo `M`, `s` is `c * a + c * c * m * i + c * i * c * m + c * a + ... (k times)`, `a` is the original value of `a` plus `m` times the value of `f`, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `m` test cases, and the value of `s` modulo `M` is being printed**
