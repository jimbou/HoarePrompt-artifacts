Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, M is 1000000007, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n*(n-1) modulo M, s is 0, a is 0, i is an integer, u is an integer, v is an integer, f is an integer, stdin contains no test cases**

The code block assigns the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input to their respective variables. It then calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of `n*(n-1)` modulo `M` and assigns it to `c`. The variable `s` is reset to 0, and `a` is also reset to 0. The values of `i`, `u`, `v`, and `f` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `s` modulo `M` is not printed as the print statement is not included in the provided code snippet.
