Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains an integer t, followed by t sets of inputs. Each set of inputs contains an integer k, followed by k lines of input, each containing three integers: n, m, and k. The function then calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of n*(n-1) modulo 10^9 + 7, and uses this value to compute a sum s. The sum s is calculated as k*(k-1)*c*i*c*m + k*c*a, where c is the modular multiplicative inverse, i is the current test case number, m is the number of lines of input, and a is the sum of the third integer in each line of input. Finally, the function prints the remainder of s divided by 10^9 + 7 for each test case.**
