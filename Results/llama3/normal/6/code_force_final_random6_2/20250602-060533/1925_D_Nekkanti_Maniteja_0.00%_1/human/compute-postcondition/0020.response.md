To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `m`. The loop will execute if `m` is at least 1. Since `i` is initially `k`, we need to adjust `i` to be 0, which is the starting value of the range. We also need to adjust `m` to be at least 1.

State: **`i` is 0, `k` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `m` is at least 1, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n*(n-1)` modulo `M`, `s` is 0, `a` is 0, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer, stdin contains at least 1 test case**
