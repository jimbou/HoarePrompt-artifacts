Output State: **`i` is `t`, `t` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n*(n-1)` modulo `M`, `s` is `k*(k-1)*c*i*c*m + k*c*a`, `a` is `m*f`, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer, stdin contains no test cases, and the remainder of `s` divided by `M` is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing all the test cases, and the final value of `s` modulo `M` is being printed. The values of `i`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c`, `a`, `u`, `v`, and `f` are as described in the output state.
