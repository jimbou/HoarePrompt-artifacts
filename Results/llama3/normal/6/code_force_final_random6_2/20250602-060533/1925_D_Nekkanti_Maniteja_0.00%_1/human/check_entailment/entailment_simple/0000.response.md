Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of children `n`, the number of pairs of friends `m`, and the number of excursions `k`.
3. It calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of `n*(n-1)` modulo `M` (where `M` is 10^9 + 7) and stores it in `c`. This is used to calculate the probability of choosing a pair of friends in each excursion.
4. It initializes `s` to 0, which will store the expected value of the sum of friendship values.
5. It reads the `m` pairs of friends and their friendship values, and calculates the sum of these values in `a`.
6. It then calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion. This is done by iterating over each excursion `i` and adding the probability of choosing a pair of friends (`c * i * c * m`) and the sum of the friendship values (`c * a`) to `s`.
7. Finally, it prints the remainder of `s` divided by `M`, which is the expected value of the sum of friendship values modulo 10^9 + 7.

The program's logic is correct, and it uses the correct formulas to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
