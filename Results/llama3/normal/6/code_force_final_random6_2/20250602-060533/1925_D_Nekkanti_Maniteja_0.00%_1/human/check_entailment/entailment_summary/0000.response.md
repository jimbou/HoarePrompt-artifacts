Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. 

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program correctly reads the input and initializes the necessary variables.
2. It calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of n*(n-1) modulo 10^9 + 7, which is used to calculate the probability of choosing a pair of friends.
3. The program correctly calculates the sum of the friendship values of all pairs of friends.
4. It then calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions using the formula k*(k-1)*c*i*c*m + k*c*a, where c is the modular multiplicative inverse, i is the current test case number, m is the number of lines of input, and a is the sum of the third integer in each line of input.
5. Finally, the program prints the remainder of the expected value divided by 10^9 + 7 for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
