Output State: **`i` is `m-1`, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n*(n-1)` modulo `M`, `s` is `c * (m-1) * c * m + c * a`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer, stdin contains no test cases, `i` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to include the result of the expression `c * i * c * m + c * a`, where `i` is equal to `m-1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that `i` is also equal to 0, which may seem contradictory, but it's possible that `i` was reassigned to 0 after the initial state was established.
