To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `k`. The loop will execute if `k` is at least 1. Since `i` is used as the loop variable, it should be initialized to the first value in the range, which is 0.

State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n*(n-1)` modulo `M`, `s` is 0, `a` is `m*f`, `i` is 0, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `stdin` contains no test cases**
