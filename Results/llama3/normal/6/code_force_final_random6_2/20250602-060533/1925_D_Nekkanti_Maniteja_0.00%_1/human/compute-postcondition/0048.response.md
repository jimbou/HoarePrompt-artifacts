Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n*(n-1)` modulo `M`, `s` is `2*c*i*c*m + 2*c*a`, `a` is `m*f`, `i` is 1, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `stdin` contains no test cases**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s` has been updated to `2*c*i*c*m + 2*c*a`, where `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n*(n-1)` modulo `M`, `i` is 1, and `a` is `m*f`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
