The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `k` must be greater than 2.
State: **`i` is 2, `k` is greater than 2, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n*(n-1)` modulo `M`, `s` is `c * a + c * c * m * i + c * i * c * m + c * a`, `a` is the original value of `a` plus `m` times the value of `f`, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `m` test cases**
