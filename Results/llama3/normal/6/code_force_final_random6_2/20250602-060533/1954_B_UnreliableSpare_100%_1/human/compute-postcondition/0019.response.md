The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n` inclusive, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1, `flag` is False if there exists at least one pair of adjacent elements in `arr` that are not equal, otherwise `flag` is True. If the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, then `cnt` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` is the minimum value between the original value of `ans` and `cnt`, `cnt` is 0, and `val` is the first element of `arr`.**
