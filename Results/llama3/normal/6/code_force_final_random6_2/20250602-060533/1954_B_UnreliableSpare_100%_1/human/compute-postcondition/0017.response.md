Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, arr is a list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin is empty, i is 0, flag is False, ans is the minimum value between the original value of ans and cnt, cnt is 0, and val is the first element of arr.**

The code snippet updates the values of `ans` and `cnt`. The first line assigns the minimum value between the original value of `ans` (which is Infinity) and `cnt` (which is 0) to `ans`. Since `cnt` is 0, `ans` becomes 0. The second line resets `cnt` to 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
