Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it not beautiful.

Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. The program first checks if all adjacent elements in the array are equal. If they are, it prints -1, which is correct because removing any number of elements from an array with all equal elements will still result in a beautiful array.

2. If not all adjacent elements are equal, the program finds the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any element in the array. This is done by iterating through the array and keeping track of the count of consecutive occurrences of the current element. The minimum count is updated whenever a new element is encountered.

3. The program correctly handles the case where the minimum count is 0, which means that there are no consecutive occurrences of any element. In this case, the program prints 0, which is correct because removing 0 elements will make the array not beautiful.

4. The program also correctly handles the case where the minimum count is greater than 0. In this case, the program prints the minimum count, which is correct because removing this number of elements will make the array not beautiful.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it not beautiful.

Correctness: **True**
