Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n` inclusive, `stdin` is empty, `i` is `n`, `flag` is False if there exists at least one pair of adjacent elements in `arr` that are not equal, otherwise `flag` is True, `ans` is the minimum value between the original value of `ans` and the maximum number of consecutive occurrences of `val` in `arr`, `cnt` is 0, and `val` is the first element of `arr`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

*   The value of `n` remains unchanged, which is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive.
*   The value of `arr` remains unchanged, which is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n` inclusive.
*   The value of `stdin` remains unchanged, which is empty.
*   The value of `i` is now `n`, indicating that the loop has executed `n` times.
*   The value of `flag` remains unchanged, which is False if there exists at least one pair of adjacent elements in `arr` that are not equal, otherwise it is True.
*   The value of `ans` is now the minimum value between the original value of `ans` and the maximum number of consecutive occurrences of `val` in `arr`.
*   The value of `cnt` is now 0.
*   The value of `val` remains unchanged, which is the first element of `arr`.
