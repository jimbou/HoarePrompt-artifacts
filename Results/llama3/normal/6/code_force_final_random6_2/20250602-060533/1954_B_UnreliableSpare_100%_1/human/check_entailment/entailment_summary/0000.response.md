Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it not beautiful. 

The program first checks if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it prints -1, because it's impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements. 

If the elements are not all the same, it finds the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any element in the array. This is because removing these consecutive occurrences would make the array not beautiful, as there would be no pair of adjacent equal elements that could be used to make all elements equal. 

The program uses a variable 'ans' to keep track of the minimum count of consecutive occurrences, and updates it whenever it finds a smaller count. 

Finally, it prints the minimum count, which is the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array not beautiful.

Correctness: **True**
