Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 3 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, arr is a list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin is empty, i is 2, flag is False. If arr[i] is not equal to arr[i - 1], then the program executes the if part. Otherwise, the program does not execute any additional operations.***
