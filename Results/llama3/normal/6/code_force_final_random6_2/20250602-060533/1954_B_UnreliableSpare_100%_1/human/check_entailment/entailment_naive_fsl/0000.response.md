Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input array has only two distinct elements, and they are alternating. In this case, the program will output the count of one of the elements, but it should output 1, because removing one element can make the array not beautiful.

For example, the input [1, 2, 1, 2, 1] should output 1, but the program will output 2.
