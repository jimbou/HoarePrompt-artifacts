Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n` inclusive, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 0, `flag` is False if there exists at least one pair of adjacent elements in `arr` that are not equal, otherwise `flag` is True, `ans` is Infinity, `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is 1, and the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to `val`.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `cnt` being 1. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and conditions.
