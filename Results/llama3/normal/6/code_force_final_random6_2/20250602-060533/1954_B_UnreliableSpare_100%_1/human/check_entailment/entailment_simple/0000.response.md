Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it not beautiful. 

The program first checks if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it prints -1, indicating that it is impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements. 

If the elements are not all the same, it then finds the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of the first element in the array. This is because the array can be made not beautiful by removing all occurrences of the first element, except for one. 

The program correctly handles the edge case where the array has only one element, in which case it prints -1. 

The program also correctly handles the case where the array has multiple elements, but all elements are the same, in which case it prints -1. 

The program correctly handles the case where the array has multiple elements, and not all elements are the same, in which case it prints the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array not beautiful. 

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
