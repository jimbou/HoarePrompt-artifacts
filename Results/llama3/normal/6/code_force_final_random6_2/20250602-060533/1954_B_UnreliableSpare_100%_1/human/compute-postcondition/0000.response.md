Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, arr is a list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, flag is True, stdin is empty**

Explanation:
The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to n. Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases, and each test case starts with an integer n, the value of n will be between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive.

The second line reads n integers from stdin and assigns them to arr. Since each test case consists of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n) that form a beautiful array, the values in arr will be between 1 and n inclusive.

The third line assigns True to flag. This line does not depend on any previous values, so flag will always be True after this line executes.

Since the code reads from stdin, the remaining input in stdin will be empty after the code executes.
