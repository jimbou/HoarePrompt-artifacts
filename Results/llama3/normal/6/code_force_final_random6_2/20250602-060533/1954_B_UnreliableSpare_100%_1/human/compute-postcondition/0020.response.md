Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n` inclusive, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1, `flag` is False if there exists at least one pair of adjacent elements in `arr` that are not equal, otherwise `flag` is True. If the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, then `cnt` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` is the minimum value between the original value of `ans` and `cnt`, `cnt` is 1, and `val` is the first element of `arr`.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1. If the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, then `cnt` is now 2. Otherwise, `ans` is the minimum value between the original value of `ans` and the original value of `cnt`, and `cnt` is now 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
