Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n` inclusive, `stdin` is empty, `i` is `n`, `ans` is the minimum value between the original value of `ans` and 0, `cnt` is 0, and `val` is the first element of `arr`. If there are no pairs of adjacent elements in `arr` that are not equal, meaning all adjacent elements in `arr` are equal, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, there exists at least one pair of adjacent elements in `arr` that are not equal, and the minimum value between the original value of `ans` and 0 is printed.***
