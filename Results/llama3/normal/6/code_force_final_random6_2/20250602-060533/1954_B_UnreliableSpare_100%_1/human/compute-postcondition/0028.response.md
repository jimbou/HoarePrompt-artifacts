Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n` inclusive, `stdin` is empty, `i` is `n`, `flag` is False if there exists at least one pair of adjacent elements in `arr` that are not equal, otherwise `flag` is True, `ans` is the minimum value between the original value of `ans` and 0, `cnt` is 0, and `val` is the first element of `arr`.**

The code updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum between its original value and `cnt`, which is 0. Therefore, `ans` is now the minimum value between its original value and 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
