Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, arr is a list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin is empty, i is 1, flag is False if there exists at least one pair of adjacent elements in arr that are not equal, otherwise flag is True. If the current value of arr[i] is equal to val, then cnt is 1. Otherwise, ans is the minimum value between the original value of ans and cnt, cnt is 0, and val is the first element of arr.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the minimum value between the original value of `ans` and `cnt` to `ans`. Since `cnt` is 0, `ans` becomes the minimum value between its original value and 0. The second line assigns 0 to `cnt`. 

The final state includes all the information from the precondition that remains valid after the code execution, and updates the values of `ans` and `cnt` that are modified by the code. The value of `ans` is now the minimum value between its original value and 0, and the value of `cnt` is now 0.
