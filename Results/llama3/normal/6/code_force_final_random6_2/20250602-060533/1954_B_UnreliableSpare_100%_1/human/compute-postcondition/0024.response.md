Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n` inclusive, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 2, `flag` is False if there exists at least one pair of adjacent elements in `arr` that are not equal, otherwise `flag` is True, `cnt` is 3 if the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, otherwise `ans` is the minimum value between the original value of `ans` and 1, `cnt` is 2, and `val` is the first element of `arr`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1. If the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, then `cnt` is now 3. Otherwise, `ans` is now the minimum value between its original value and 1, and `cnt` is now 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
