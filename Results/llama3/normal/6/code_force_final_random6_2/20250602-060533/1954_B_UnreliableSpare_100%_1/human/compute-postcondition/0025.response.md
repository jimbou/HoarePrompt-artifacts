Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, arr is a list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin is empty, i is 2, flag is False if there exists at least one pair of adjacent elements in arr that are not equal, otherwise flag is True, ans is the minimum value between the original value of ans and cnt, cnt is 0, val is the first element of arr.**

The code block consists of two lines. The first line assigns the minimum value between the original value of `ans` and `cnt` to `ans`. Since `cnt` is 2, `ans` becomes the minimum value between its original value and 2. The second line resets `cnt` to 0. No other variables are affected.
