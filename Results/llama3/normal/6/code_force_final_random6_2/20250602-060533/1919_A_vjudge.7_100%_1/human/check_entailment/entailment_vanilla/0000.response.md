Reasoning:

The problem is asking us to determine who will win a game between Alice and Bob, where they take turns exchanging wallets and removing coins. The game ends when one player cannot make a valid move.

The provided program uses a simple approach to solve this problem. It reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. It then checks if the sum of the coins in both wallets is even or odd. If the sum is even, it prints 'Bob', otherwise it prints 'Alice'.

The reasoning behind this approach is that the game is symmetric, meaning that the players can mirror each other's moves. If the sum of the coins in both wallets is even, then Alice will always be the one to make the last move, because she will always have an even number of coins in her wallet. Since she cannot make a move with 0 coins, Bob will win. On the other hand, if the sum of the coins in both wallets is odd, then Bob will always be the one to make the last move, and Alice will win.

This approach is correct because it takes into account the symmetry of the game and the fact that the players can mirror each other's moves. It also correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the sum of the coins in both wallets.

Correctness: **True**
