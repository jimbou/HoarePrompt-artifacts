Reasoning:

The given program is correct. The problem description states that the player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses, and the game is played optimally. The key observation here is that the game is won by the player who has the opportunity to make the last move, which happens when the sum of the coins in both wallets is odd.

The program correctly implements this logic by checking if the sum of the coins in both wallets (a + b) is even or odd. If the sum is even, it means that Alice will not have the opportunity to make the last move, so Bob wins. If the sum is odd, it means that Alice will have the opportunity to make the last move, so Alice wins.

The program uses the bitwise AND operator (&) to check if the sum is even or odd. This is a clever optimization, as it avoids the need to explicitly calculate the sum and then check if it's even or odd.

The execution summary correctly describes the behavior of the program, and the example inputs and outputs match the expected behavior.

Correctness: **True**
