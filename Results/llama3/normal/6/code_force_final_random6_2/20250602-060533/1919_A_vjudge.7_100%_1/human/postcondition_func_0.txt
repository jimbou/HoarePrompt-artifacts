This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each case consists of two integers. It then determines the winner of each case based on the sum of the two integers being even or odd, printing 'Bob' for even sums and 'Alice' for odd sums. The function continues this process until all test cases have been read from standard input, ultimately emptying the input buffer.
