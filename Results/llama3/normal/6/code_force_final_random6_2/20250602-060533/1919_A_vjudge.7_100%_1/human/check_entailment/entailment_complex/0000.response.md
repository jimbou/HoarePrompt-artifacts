Reasoning:

The problem statement describes a game where Alice and Bob take turns exchanging wallets and removing coins. The game ends when one player cannot make a valid move, and that player loses. The problem asks to determine who will win the game if both players play optimally.

The given program uses a simple strategy to determine the winner. It checks if the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even or odd. If the sum is even, it prints 'Bob', and if the sum is odd, it prints 'Alice'.

This strategy is correct because of the way the game is structured. When Alice and Bob exchange wallets, the total number of coins remains the same. When a player removes a coin from their wallet, the total number of coins decreases by 1. Since the game starts with an even number of coins (both Alice and Bob have at least 1 coin), the total number of coins will always be even.

If the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even, it means that Alice has an even number of coins and Bob has an even number of coins. In this case, Alice will always be forced to remove a coin from her wallet, leaving her with an odd number of coins. Then, Bob will exchange wallets with Alice, leaving him with an odd number of coins. This process will continue until one of the players has 0 coins, at which point the other player will win.

On the other hand, if the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is odd, it means that one of the players has an odd number of coins and the other has an even number of coins. In this case, the player with the odd number of coins will always be able to exchange wallets with the other player, leaving them with an even number of coins. This process will continue until one of the players has 0 coins, at which point the other player will win.

Therefore, the given program is correct, and the answer is:

Correctness: **True**
