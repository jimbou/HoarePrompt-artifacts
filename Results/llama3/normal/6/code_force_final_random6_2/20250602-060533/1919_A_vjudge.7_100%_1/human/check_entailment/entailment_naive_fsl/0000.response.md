Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the total number of coins in both Alice's and Bob's wallets. The key insight is that the game is won by the player who makes the last move, which is determined by the parity of the total number of coins.

The program uses the bitwise AND operator (&) to check if the sum of the coins is even (a + b & 1 == 0). If the sum is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. This is because if the sum is even, Alice will always be forced to make the last move, which means she will lose.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the examples provided in the problem description. It also handles edge cases, such as when one or both players have only one coin.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all possible inputs.
