The code `test = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `test`. The stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). After accepting the first integer, the stdin now contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9).

Output State: **`test` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9).**
