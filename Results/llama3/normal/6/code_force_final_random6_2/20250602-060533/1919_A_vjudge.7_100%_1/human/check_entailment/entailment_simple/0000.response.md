Reasoning: 

The problem description states that the game is won by the player who can make the last valid move. A valid move consists of two steps: (1) choosing to exchange wallets with the opponent or keeping the current wallet, and (2) removing 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The game ends when a player cannot make a valid move, which happens when their wallet is empty.

The given program uses the fact that the game is won by the player who can make the last valid move. It calculates the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets (a + b) and checks if it is even or odd. If the sum is even, it prints 'Bob', indicating that Bob will win the game. If the sum is odd, it prints 'Alice', indicating that Alice will win the game.

The reasoning behind this is that if the sum of the coins is even, Alice will always be forced to make a move that leaves an even number of coins in her wallet. Since Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, he will always have an even number of coins in his wallet as well. Therefore, when Alice's wallet is empty, Bob's wallet will also be empty, and Bob will win the game.

On the other hand, if the sum of the coins is odd, Alice can always make a move that leaves an odd number of coins in her wallet. This will force Bob to make a move that leaves an even number of coins in his wallet. Therefore, when Bob's wallet is empty, Alice's wallet will still have coins, and Alice will win the game.

Correctness: **True**
