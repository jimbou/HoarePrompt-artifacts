Output State: **`test` is an integer between 0 and 999 and greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9, `t` is 2, stdin contains test-2 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9).**

In this output state, the values of `test`, `t` are still the same as in the initial state. The values of `a` and `b` are updated to be the integers from the first line of the input, which are between 1 and 10^9. The stdin now contains `test-2` lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), since one line has been consumed by the input operation.
