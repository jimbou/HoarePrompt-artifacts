The only variables in the loop head are variables  t and test, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `test`. If `test` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `test` is an integer between 1 and 1000 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `test` is greater than 0 and t is now 0. 
State: **`test` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, stdin contains test-1 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), t is 0**
