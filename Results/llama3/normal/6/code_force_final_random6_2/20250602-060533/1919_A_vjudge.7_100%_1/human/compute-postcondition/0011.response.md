Output State: **`test` is an integer between 0 and 999 and greater than 0, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9, `t` is 1, stdin contains test lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). If the sum of `a` and `b` is even, 'Bob' is printed. If the sum of `a` and `b` is odd, 'Alice' is printed.**

The code reads two integers from the input, which are assigned to `a` and `b`. The values of `test` and `t` remain unchanged. The stdin now contains `test-1` lines, each containing two integers. The condition for printing 'Bob' or 'Alice' is still based on the sum of `a` and `b`.
