Postcondition: ***`test` is an integer between 0 and 999 and greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9, `t` is 2, stdin contains test-2 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). If the sum of `a` and `b` is even, 'Bob' is being printed. Otherwise, 'Alice' is being printed.***
