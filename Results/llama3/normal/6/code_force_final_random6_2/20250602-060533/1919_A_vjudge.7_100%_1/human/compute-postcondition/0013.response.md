Output: **`test` is an integer between 0 and 999 and greater than 0, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9, `t` is 1, stdin contains test lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). If the sum of `a` and `b` is even, 'Bob' is printed. If the sum of `a` and `b` is odd, 'Alice' is printed, and 'Bob' is printed**
