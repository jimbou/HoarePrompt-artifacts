Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least one element, `r` is an integer, `c` is a string with the current value of '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing at least one element which is the remainder of (q - r) divided by n, and `q` is the first element in `ans`. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` contains at least one element which is the remainder of (q + r) divided by n. Otherwise, `temp` remains an empty set.**

In this output state, the value of `temp` has been updated to include the remainder of `(q - r)` divided by `n`. The other variables remain unchanged. The set `temp` now contains at least one element, which is the result of the expression `(q - r) % n`. The value of `c` is still either '1' or '?', and the value of `q` is still the first element in the set `ans`.
