The only variable in the loop head is variable  q, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ans`. If `ans` has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `ans` is not empty, `q` is an element of `ans`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the `ans` must have at least 2 elements and the `q` is the second element of `ans`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is not empty and has at least 2 elements, `r` is an integer, `c` is a string, `q` is the second element of `ans`. If `c` is either '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing one element which is (q - r) % n. Otherwise, `temp` is a set containing one element which is (q + r) % n.**
