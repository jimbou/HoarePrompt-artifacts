The `print(*sorted(ans))` statement will print all the unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for all `q` in the initial `ans`, except 0, plus `n` if 0 was in the initial `ans`, in sorted order.

Since the exact values of `q`, `r`, and `n` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the sorted list of unique values of these expressions.

Output: **a sorted list of unique values of (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n for all q in the initial ans, except 0, plus n if 0 was in the initial ans**
