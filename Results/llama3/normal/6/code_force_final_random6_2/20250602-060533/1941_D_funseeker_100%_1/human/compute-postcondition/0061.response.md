Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 2, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a non-empty set containing at least two elements, `r` is an integer, `q` is another element in the ans. If `c` is '0', `temp` is a set containing at least two elements which are the remainder of the sum of `q` and `r` divided by `n`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing at least four elements which are the remainder of the sum of `q` and `r` divided by `n`, the remainder of the difference of `q` and `r` divided by `n`, the remainder of the sum of `q` and `r` divided by `n`, and the remainder of the difference of `q` and `r` divided by `n`.***
