Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described. The program uses a set to keep track of the possible positions of the ball after each throw. It iterates over the throws, updating the set of possible positions based on the distance and direction of each throw. If the direction is unknown ('?'), it considers both clockwise and counterclockwise directions. After all throws have been processed, it prints the number of unique possible positions and the positions themselves in sorted order.

The program correctly handles the case where the ball's position wraps around the circle (i.e., when the position is 0, it is replaced with n). It also correctly handles the case where the direction of a throw is unknown.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states provided as comments.

Correctness: **True**
