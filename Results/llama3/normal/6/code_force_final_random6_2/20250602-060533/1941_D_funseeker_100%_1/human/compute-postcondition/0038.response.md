Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least 3 elements, `r` is an integer, `c` is a string, and `q` is the third element in `ans`. If `c` is '0', `temp` contains at least one element which is the remainder of (q + r) divided by n. If `c` is '?', `temp` contains at least one element which is the remainder of (q - r) divided by n. If `c` is neither '0' nor '?', `temp` remains unchanged.***
