Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 2, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` <= `n`, `ans` is a set containing all possible values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for all `q` in the initial `ans`, `r` is an integer, `temp` is a set containing all possible values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for all `q` in the initial `ans`**

The value of `ans` is updated to be equal to `temp`, which is a set containing all possible values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for all `q` in the initial `ans`. The values of the other variables are not affected.
