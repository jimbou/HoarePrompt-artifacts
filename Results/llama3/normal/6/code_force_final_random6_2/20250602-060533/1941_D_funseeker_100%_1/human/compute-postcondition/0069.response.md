Output: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` <= `n`, `ans` is a set containing all possible values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for all `q` in the initial `ans`, except 0, plus n if 0 was in the initial `ans`, `r` is an integer, `c` is a string, and the size of the set `ans` which is the number of unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for all `q` in the initial `ans`, except 0, plus n if 0 was in the initial `ans` is being printed**
