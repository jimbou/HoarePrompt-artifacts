Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is not empty and has at least 3 elements, `r` is an integer, `c` is a string, `q` is the third element of `ans`. If `c` is either '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing four elements which are (q - r) % n, (q + r) % n, (q - r) % n and (q + r) % n. If `c` is '0', `temp` is a set containing four elements which are (q + r) % n, (q + r) % n, (q - r) % n and (q + r) % n.**

In this output state, the value of `temp` has been updated by adding a new element `(q + r) % n` to the set. The other variables remain unchanged. The set `temp` now contains four elements, which are a combination of the original elements and the newly added element. The conditions for `c` being either '1', '?', or '0' still apply, determining the composition of the set `temp`.
