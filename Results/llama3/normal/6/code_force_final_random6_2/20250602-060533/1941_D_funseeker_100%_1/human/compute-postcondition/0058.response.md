Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 2, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a non-empty set containing at least two elements, `r` is an integer, `q` is another element in the ans. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing at least three elements which are the remainder of the sum of `q` and `r` divided by `n`, the remainder of the difference of `q` and `r` divided by `n`, and the remainder of the sum of `q` and `r` divided by `n`. If `c` is '0', `temp` is a set containing at least two elements which are the remainder of the sum of `q` and `r` divided by `n` and the remainder of the sum of `q` and `r` divided by `n`.**

In this output state, the value of `temp` has been updated by adding the remainder of the sum of `q` and `r` divided by `n`. The other variables remain unchanged. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` now contains at least three elements, including the new addition. If `c` is '0', `temp` now contains at least two elements, including the new addition.
