Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the possible positions of the ball after a series of throws. It uses a set to keep track of the possible positions, which allows it to efficiently handle the cases where the direction of the throw is unknown ('?').

The program correctly handles the cases where the throw is clockwise or counterclockwise, and it also correctly handles the case where the direction is unknown. It uses the modulo operator to ensure that the positions are wrapped around the circle correctly.

The program also correctly handles the case where the initial position of the ball is 0, by discarding 0 from the set and adding n to it.

I have not found any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
