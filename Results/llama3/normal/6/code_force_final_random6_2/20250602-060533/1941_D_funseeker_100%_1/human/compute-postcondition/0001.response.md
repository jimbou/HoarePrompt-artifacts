According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If `m` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, and `ans` is a set containing `x`. These states do not ensure that the loop will execute, so they need to be adjusted to `m` is greater than 0.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, ans is a set containing `x`**
