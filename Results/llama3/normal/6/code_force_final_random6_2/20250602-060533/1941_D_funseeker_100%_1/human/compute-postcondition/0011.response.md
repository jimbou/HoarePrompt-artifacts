Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is not empty and has at least 2 elements, `r` is an integer, `c` is a string, `q` is the second element of `ans`. If `c` is either '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing two elements which are (q - r) % n and (q + r) % n. Otherwise, `temp` is a set containing two elements which are (q + r) % n and (q + r) % n.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `r`, `c`, and `q` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is in the `temp` set. If `c` is either '1' or '?', `temp` now contains two elements: `(q - r) % n` and `(q + r) % n`. If `c` is not '1' or '?', `temp` now contains two elements: `(q + r) % n` and `(q + r) % n`.
