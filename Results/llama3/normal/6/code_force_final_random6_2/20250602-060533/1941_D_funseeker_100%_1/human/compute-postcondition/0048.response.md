Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 2, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a non-empty set containing all possible values of (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n for all q in the initial ans, `r` is an integer. If `c` is either '0' or '?', then `temp` is a set containing at least one element (q + r) % n for some q in the initial ans. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
