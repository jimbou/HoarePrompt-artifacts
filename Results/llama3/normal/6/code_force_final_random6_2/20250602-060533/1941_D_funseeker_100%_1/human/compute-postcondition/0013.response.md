Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is not empty and has at least 2 elements, `r` is an integer, `c` is a string, `q` is the second element of `ans`. If `c` is either '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing three elements which are (q - r) % n, (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n. If `c` is '0', `temp` is a set containing three elements which are (q + r) % n, (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n.**

In this output state, the value of `temp` has been updated by adding `(q - r) % n` to the set. The other variables remain unchanged. The set `temp` now contains three elements, where the new element `(q - r) % n` is added to the existing elements. The condition on `c` still determines the other two elements in the set `temp`.
