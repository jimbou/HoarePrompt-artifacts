Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is greater than 1, x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, ans is a set containing all possible values of (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n for all q in the initial ans, r is an integer, c is a string, temp is an empty set**

The code snippet consists of three lines. The first line assigns the result of `func_1().split()` to `r` and `c`. Since `func_1()` is not defined in the given code, we assume it returns a string that can be split into two parts. The second line converts the value of `r` to an integer. The third line initializes an empty set `temp`.

The initial state of the variables is preserved, except for `r` which is now an integer, and `temp` which is a new empty set. The value of `ans` is not modified by the code, so it remains a set containing all possible values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for all `q` in the initial `ans`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `x` are not affected by the code and remain the same.
