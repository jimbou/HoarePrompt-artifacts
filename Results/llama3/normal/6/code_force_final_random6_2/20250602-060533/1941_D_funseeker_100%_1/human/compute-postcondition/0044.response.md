Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is greater than 2, x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, ans is a set containing all possible values of (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n for all q in the initial ans, r is an integer, c is a string, temp is an empty set.**

The code snippet executes as follows: The first line assigns the result of `func_1().split()` to `r` and `c`. Since `func_1()` is not defined in the given code, we assume it returns a string containing a space-separated integer and string. The second line converts the value of `r` to an integer. The third line initializes an empty set `temp`. 

The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, and `ans` are not modified by the code snippet. The value of `r` is updated to an integer, and `c` is assigned a string value. The variable `temp` is introduced as an empty set.
