Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is not empty, `r` is an integer, `c` is a string, `q` is an element of `ans`. If `c` is either '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing one element which is (q - r) % n. Otherwise, `temp` is a set containing one element which is (q + r) % n.***
