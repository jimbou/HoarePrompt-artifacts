Reasoning: 
The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described. It correctly reads the input, processes the information about each throw, and calculates the possible positions of the ball after m throws. The program handles the cases where the direction of the throw is unknown ('?') by considering both clockwise and counterclockwise directions. The final positions are stored in a set to ensure uniqueness and then printed in sorted order.

The program also correctly handles the case where the calculated position is 0 by replacing it with n, as the problem statement specifies that the players are numbered from 1 to n.

Overall, the program meets the problem description and is correct.

Correctness: **True**
