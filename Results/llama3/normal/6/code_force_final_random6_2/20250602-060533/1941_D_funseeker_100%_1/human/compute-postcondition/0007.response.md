Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is not empty, `r` is an integer, `c` is a string that is either '1' or '?', `q` is an element of `ans`. The current value of `c` is either '1' or '?'. If `c` was either '0' or '?', `temp` was a set containing one element which was (q + r) % n, but now `c` is '1' or '?', so `temp` remains an empty set.**
