Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 2, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a non-empty set containing all possible values of (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n for all q in the initial ans, `r` is an integer, `c` is a string that is either '0' or '?', and `temp` is a set containing at least one element (q + r) % n for some q in the initial ans.**

In this output state, the value of `temp` has been updated to include at least one element, which is the result of the expression `(q + r) % n` for some `q` in the initial `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged.
