Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing all possible values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for all `q` in the initial `ans`, `r` is an integer, `c` is a string**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be equal to `temp`, which is a set containing all possible values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for all `q` in the initial `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged.
