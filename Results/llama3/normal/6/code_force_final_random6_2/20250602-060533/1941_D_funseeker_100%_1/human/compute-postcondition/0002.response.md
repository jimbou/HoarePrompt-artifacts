Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is greater than 0, x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, ans is a set containing x, r is an integer, c is a string, temp is an empty set**

The code executes as follows: 

The first line assigns the result of `func_1()` to `r` and `c`, splitting the result into two parts. Since `func_1()` is not defined in the provided code, we assume it returns a string that can be split into two parts. The first part is converted to an integer and assigned to `r`, while the second part is assigned to `c` as a string.

The second line creates an empty set and assigns it to `temp`. This does not affect any other variables.

After executing the code, the values of `n`, `m`, `x`, and `ans` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The new variables `r`, `c`, and `temp` are introduced, with `r` being an integer, `c` being a string, and `temp` being an empty set.
