Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least one element, `r` is an integer, `c` is a string that is either '0' or '?', `temp` is a set containing at least one element which is the remainder of (q + r) divided by n, and `q` is the first element in `ans`.**

In this output state, the value of `temp` has been updated to include the remainder of `(q + r)` divided by `n`, where `q` is the first element in `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged.
