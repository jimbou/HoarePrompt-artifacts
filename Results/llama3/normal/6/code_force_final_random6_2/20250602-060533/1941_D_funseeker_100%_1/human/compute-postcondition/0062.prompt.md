Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, m is greater than 2, x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, ans is a set containing all possible values of (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n for all q in the initial ans, r is an integer, c is a string, temp is an empty set.
Code of the loop:
for q in ans:
    if c == '0' or c == '?':
        temp.add((q + r) % n)
    if c == '1' or c == '?':
        temp.add((q - r) % n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 2, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a non-empty set containing all possible values of (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n for all q in the initial ans, `r` is an integer. If `c` is '1', then the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `c` is '?', then `temp` is a set containing at least two elements (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n for some q in the initial ans. If `c` is '0', then `temp` is a set containing at least one element (q + r) % n for some q in the initial ans. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 2, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a non-empty set containing at least two elements, `r` is an integer, `q` is another element in the ans. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing at least two elements which are the remainder of the sum of `q` and `r` divided by `n` and the remainder of the difference of `q` and `r` divided by `n`. If `c` is '0', `temp` is a set containing at least one element which is the remainder of the sum of `q` and `r` divided by `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 2, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a non-empty set containing at least two elements, `r` is an integer, `q` is another element in the ans. If `c` is '0', `temp` is a set containing at least two elements which are the remainder of the sum of `q` and `r` divided by `n`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing at least four elements which are the remainder of the sum of `q` and `r` divided by `n`, the remainder of the difference of `q` and `r` divided by `n`, the remainder of the sum of `q` and `r` divided by `n`, and the remainder of the difference of `q` and `r` divided by `n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
