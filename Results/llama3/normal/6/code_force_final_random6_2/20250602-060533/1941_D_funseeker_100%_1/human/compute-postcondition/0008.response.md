Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is not empty, `r` is an integer, `c` is a string that is either '1' or '?', `q` is an element of `ans`, and `temp` is a set containing one element which is (q - r) % n.**

In this output state, all the variables retain their initial properties, except for `temp`. The value of `temp` is now a set containing a single element, which is the result of the expression `(q - r) % n`. This means that `temp` now holds a unique value that is the remainder of the division of `q - r` by `n`.
