Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 2, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a non-empty set containing all possible values of (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n for all q in the initial ans, `r` is an integer. The current value of `c` is either '1' or '?'. If `c` is '?', then `temp` is a set containing at least two elements (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n for some q in the initial ans. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `temp` has been updated to include the element `(q - r) % n` for some `q` in the initial `ans`. If `c` is '?', then `temp` now contains at least two elements: `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. The other variables remain unchanged.
