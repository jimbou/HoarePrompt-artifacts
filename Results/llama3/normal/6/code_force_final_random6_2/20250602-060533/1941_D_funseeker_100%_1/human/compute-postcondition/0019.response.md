Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is not empty and has at least 3 elements, `r` is an integer, `c` is a string, `q` is the third element of `ans`. If `c` is either '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing five elements which are (q - r) % n, (q + r) % n, (q - r) % n, (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n. If `c` is '0', `temp` is a set containing five elements which are (q + r) % n, (q + r) % n, (q - r) % n, (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n. If `c` is neither '0' nor '?', the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
