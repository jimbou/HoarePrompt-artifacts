Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program's correctness:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `func_2()`, which is correct.

2. For each test case, the program reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the initial player `x` using `func_3()`, which is correct.

3. The program initializes a set `ans` with the initial player `x`, which is correct.

4. The program iterates over each throw. For each throw, it reads the distance `r` and direction `c` using `func_1()`, which is correct.

5. For each throw, the program calculates the possible next players based on the direction `c`. If `c` is '0' or '?', it adds the player `(q + r) % n` to the temporary set `temp`. If `c` is '1' or '?', it adds the player `(q - r) % n` to `temp`. This is correct because the modulus operation `%` ensures that the player number wraps around the circle.

6. After calculating the possible next players for each throw, the program updates the set `ans` with the temporary set `temp`, which is correct.

7. After all throws, the program checks if `0` is in the set `ans` and replaces it with `n` if necessary, which is correct because player numbers range from `1` to `n`.

8. Finally, the program prints the number of possible players and their numbers in sorted order, which is correct.

Correctness: **True**
