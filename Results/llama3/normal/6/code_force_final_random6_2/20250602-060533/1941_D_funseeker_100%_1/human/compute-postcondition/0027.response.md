Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least one element, `r` is an integer, `c` is a string, `temp` is a set, and `q` is the first element in `ans`. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` contains at least one element which is the remainder of (q + r) divided by n. Otherwise, `temp` remains an empty set.***
