Output State: **i is 2, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9)**

The code reads a line from stdin, splits it into two integers, and assigns them to `a` and `b`. The previous values of `a` and `b` are overwritten. The value of `i` remains unchanged. Stdin now contains one less line.
