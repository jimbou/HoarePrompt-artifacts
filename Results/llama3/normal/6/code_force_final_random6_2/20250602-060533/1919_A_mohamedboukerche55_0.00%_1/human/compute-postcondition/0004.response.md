The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and stdin, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and stdin. If `i` is less than the number of lines in stdin, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-3 lines. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and stdin must contain at least t-2 lines.
State: **`i` is 2, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9)**
