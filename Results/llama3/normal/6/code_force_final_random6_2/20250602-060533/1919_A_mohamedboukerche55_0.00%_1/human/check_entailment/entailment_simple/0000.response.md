Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob, where they take turns exchanging wallets and removing coins. The key observation is that the game is won by the player who can make the last move, which happens when the sum of the coins in both wallets is odd.

The given program correctly implements this logic by checking if the sum of the coins in both wallets is even or odd. If the sum is even, Bob wins; if the sum is odd, Alice wins. This is because when the sum is even, Alice will always be the one to make the last move, and when the sum is odd, Bob will always be the one to make the last move.

The program correctly reads the input, splits it into two integers, and applies the logic to determine the winner. The output is also correct, printing "bob" when the sum is even and "alice" when the sum is odd.

Correctness: **True**
