Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob, where they take turns exchanging wallets and removing coins. The game ends when one player cannot make a valid move. The problem statement provides examples and notes that the winner can be determined by the parity of the sum of the coins in both wallets.

The provided Python program reads pairs of integers from standard input, calculates the sum of each pair, and prints 'bob' if the sum is even or 'alice' if the sum is odd. This is based on the observation that if the sum of the coins in both wallets is even, Bob will win, and if the sum is odd, Alice will win.

The program's logic is correct because it accurately implements the strategy for determining the winner based on the parity of the sum of the coins. The program does not contain any syntax errors or logical flaws that would affect its correctness.

Correctness: **True**
