Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. The problem can be solved by determining whether the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even or odd. If the sum is even, Bob will win, and if the sum is odd, Alice will win. This is because the players take turns removing one coin from their wallet, and the player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If the sum of the coins is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring that he will not be the one to make the last move. On the other hand, if the sum of the coins is odd, Alice can always make a move that will leave Bob with an even number of coins, forcing him to make the last move.

The program correctly implements this logic by reading the input pairs of integers, calculating the sum of each pair, and printing 'bob' if the sum is even or 'alice' if the sum is odd.

Correctness: **True**
