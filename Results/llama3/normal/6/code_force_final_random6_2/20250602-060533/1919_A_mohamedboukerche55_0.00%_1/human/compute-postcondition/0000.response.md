To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and the input from `stdin`. The loop will execute as long as there is at least one integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) in the input, followed by `t` lines, each containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9).

State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), i is 0**
