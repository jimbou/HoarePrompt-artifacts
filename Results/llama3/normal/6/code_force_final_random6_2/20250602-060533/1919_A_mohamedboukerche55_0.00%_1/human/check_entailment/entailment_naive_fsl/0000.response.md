Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the total number of coins in both wallets. The key insight is that the game is won by the player who can make the last move, which is determined by the parity of the total number of coins.

The program uses the fact that if the total number of coins is even, Bob will win, and if it's odd, Alice will win. This is because the players take turns removing one coin from their wallet, and the player who can make the last move is the one who has the opportunity to remove the last coin.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including when the number of coins in both wallets is the same, and when one wallet has more coins than the other. It also correctly handles the case when the total number of coins is 1, in which case Alice will win.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the strategy for winning the game. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
