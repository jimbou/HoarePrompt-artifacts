The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and input. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `input`. If `i` is less than `int(input())`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `int(input())` is `t`. So for the loop to execute again `i` is 1 and `int(input())` is `t` and `stdin` contains `t-2` lines, each containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9).
State: **`i` is 1, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9)**
