Output State: **`q` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive), stdin contains q-1 lines, each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9)**

In this output state, the values of `q` and `i` remain unchanged. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values of the first line of input from stdin, which contains three digits between 0 and 9 (inclusive). The stdin now contains q-1 lines of input, each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9).
