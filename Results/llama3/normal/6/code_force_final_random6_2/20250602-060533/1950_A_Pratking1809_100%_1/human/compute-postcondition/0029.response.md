Based on the precondition, the code will print the string 'PEAK' when the print statement is executed.

The variables `q`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not used in the print statement, so their values do not affect the output.

The print statement simply prints the string 'PEAK', which is a literal value.

Output: **PEAK**
