Postcondition: **`q` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive), stdin contains q-1 lines, each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9). The current values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are such that `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`.**
