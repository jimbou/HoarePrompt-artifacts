Output State: **`q` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is `q-1`, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive), `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned the values of the last line of stdin, stdin is empty. If `a` < `b` < `c`, then 'STAIR' is printed. If `a` < `b` and `b` > `c`, then 'PEAK' is printed. Otherwise, 'NONE' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has processed all the input lines from stdin, and the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are the last set of values read from stdin. The loop has printed 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' for each set of values based on the conditions in the loop body. The loop has finished executing, and the program has terminated.
