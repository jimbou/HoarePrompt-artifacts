Output State: **`q` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive), `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned the values of the first line of stdin, stdin contains q-2 lines, each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9).**

In this output state, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to the first line of the input from stdin, which contains three digits between 0 and 9 (inclusive). The values of `q` and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin now contains q-2 lines, each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9), as one line has been consumed by the input operation.
