Postcondition: ***`q` is an integer between 3 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive), `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned the values of the second line of stdin, stdin contains q-3 lines, each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9). If `a` < `b` < `c`, then 'STAIR' is printed. If `a` < `b` and `b` > `c`, then 'PEAK' is printed. Otherwise, 'NONE' is printed.***
