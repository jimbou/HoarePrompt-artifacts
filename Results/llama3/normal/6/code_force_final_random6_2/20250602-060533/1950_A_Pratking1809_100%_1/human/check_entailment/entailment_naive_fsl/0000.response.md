Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly identifies whether the given three digits form a stair, a peak, or neither. It checks the conditions for a stair (a < b < c) and a peak (a < b > c) and prints the corresponding output. If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE".

The program handles all possible cases, including when the digits are equal, and when they do not form a stair or a peak. The use of elif and else statements ensures that only one condition is checked at a time, and the program does not print multiple outputs for a single input.

I could not find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
