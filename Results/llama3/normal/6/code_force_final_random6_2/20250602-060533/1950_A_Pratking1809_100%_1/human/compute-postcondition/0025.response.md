The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `q`. If `i` is less than `q`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `q` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `q` must be greater than 2.
State: **`q` is an integer between 3 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive), `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned the values of the second line of stdin, stdin contains q-2 lines, each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9). If a < b < c, 'STAIR' is printed. If a < b > c, 'PEAK' is printed. Otherwise, 'NONE' is printed.**
