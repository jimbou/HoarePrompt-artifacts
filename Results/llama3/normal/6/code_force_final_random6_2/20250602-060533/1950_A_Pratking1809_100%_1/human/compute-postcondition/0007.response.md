Postcondition: ***`q` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive), stdin contains q-1 lines, each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9). The condition (a < b < c) is false. The current value of a is less than b and b is greater than c***
