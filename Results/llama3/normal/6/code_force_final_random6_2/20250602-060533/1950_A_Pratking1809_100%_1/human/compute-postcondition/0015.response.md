The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `q`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `q`. If `i` is less than `q`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `q` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `q` must be greater than 1.
State: **`q` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive), stdin contains q-1 lines, each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9).**
