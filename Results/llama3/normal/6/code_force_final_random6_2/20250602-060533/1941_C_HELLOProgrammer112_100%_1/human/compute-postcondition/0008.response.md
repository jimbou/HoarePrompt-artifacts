To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The objects involved are `_` and `stdin` (which contains the input).

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 1, and `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases.

For the loop to execute again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `stdin` needs to have at least one more test case.

So, at the start of the next iteration:

* `_` is 2
* `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases (since one test case has been consumed in the previous iteration)

The other variables `a`, `s`, `x`, `y`, and `z` are not involved in the loop head, so their states remain the same.

State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first input, `s` is a string equal to the second input, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`, `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`, `z` is the number of occurrences of 'mapie' in `s`, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases**
