The only variables in the loop head are variable `_` and `int(input())`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `int(input())`. If `int(input())` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains t test cases does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `int(input())` is greater than 0 and `_` is now 0.
State: **stdin contains t test cases that must have at least 1 test case, _ is 0**
