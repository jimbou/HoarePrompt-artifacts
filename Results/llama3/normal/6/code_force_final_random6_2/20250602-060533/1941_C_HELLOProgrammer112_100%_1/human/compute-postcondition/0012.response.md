Output State: **a is an integer equal to the last input, s is a string equal to the last input, x is the number of occurrences of 'map' in s, y is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in s, z is the number of occurrences of 'mapie' in s, _ is t-1, stdin contains 0 test cases, and the sum of the number of occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' minus the number of occurrences of 'mapie' in s is being printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variables a, s, x, y, and z will hold the values corresponding to the last test case. The loop counter _ will be one less than the total number of test cases t. The standard input stdin will be empty, as all test cases would have been processed. Finally, the program will print the sum of the occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' minus the occurrences of 'mapie' for the last test case.
