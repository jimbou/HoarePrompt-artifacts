The code prints the sum of the number of occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' in the string `s`, minus the number of occurrences of 'mapie' in the string `s`. Where `s` is the third input, 'map' is a substring of `s`, 'pie' is a substring of `s`, and 'mapie' is a substring of `s`. The values of 'map', 'pie', and 'mapie' are determined by the number of times they appear in the string `s`.

Output: **x + y - z (where x is the number of occurrences of 'map' in s, y is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in s, and z is the number of occurrences of 'mapie' in s)**
