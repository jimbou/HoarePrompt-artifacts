Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted from a given string to make it beautiful. The string is considered beautiful if it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map".

The program works by counting the number of occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the input string, and then subtracting the number of occurrences of the substring "mapie" (which is a combination of "map" and "pie"). This is because if "mapie" is present in the string, it means that both "map" and "pie" are present, and deleting one of them would make the string beautiful.

The program then prints the sum of the number of occurrences of "map" and "pie" minus the number of occurrences of "mapie". This gives the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

The program correctly handles the case where the string is already beautiful (i.e., it does not contain "map" or "pie"), in which case it prints 0.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
