To determine what will be printed when the given statement executes, let's break down the code step by step.

1. `line.split()`: This splits the seventh line (`line`) into a list of words or tokens, using whitespace as the delimiter. The result is a list of strings, where each string represents a word from the line.

2. `tokens := line.split()`: This is an assignment expression (introduced in Python 3.8) that assigns the result of `line.split()` to the variable `tokens`. So, `tokens` is now a list of words from the seventh line.

3. `{*tokens}`: This is a set comprehension that creates a set from the elements of `tokens`. A set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements. So, `{*tokens}` is a set containing the unique words from the seventh line.

4. `len(tokens)`: This gives the number of elements in the `tokens` list, which is the total number of words in the seventh line.

5. `len({*tokens})`: This gives the number of elements in the set `{*tokens}`, which is the number of unique words in the seventh line.

6. `len(tokens) - len({*tokens})`: This calculates the difference between the total number of words and the number of unique words in the seventh line. Essentially, it counts the number of duplicate words (since the difference between the total count and the unique count gives the count of words that appear more than once).

So, when the `print` statement executes, it will print the number of duplicate words in the seventh line of `stdin`.

Output: **the number of duplicate words in the seventh line of stdin**
