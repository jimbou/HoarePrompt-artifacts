The only objects in the loop head are variables  line and stdin, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the stdin.  If the stdin has at least 5 lines the loop executes again for the fifth time. At the end of the last iteration, stdin has at least 3 lines, line is the third line. So for the loop to be executed one more time the stdin must have at least 5 lines and the line is the fifth line.
State: **`stdin` contains at least five lines, `line` is the fifth line, and this is printed: the difference between the number of tokens in the fifth line and the number of unique tokens in the fifth line**
