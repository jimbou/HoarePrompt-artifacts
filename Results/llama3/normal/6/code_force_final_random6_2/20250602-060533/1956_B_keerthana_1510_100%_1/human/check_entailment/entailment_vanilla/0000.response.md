Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how it works:

1. The program reads input from standard input (`[*open(0)]`).
2. It skips the first two lines of input (`[2::2]`), which correspond to the number of test cases and the first line of each test case (the number of cards).
3. For each remaining line (which represents the cards in the player's hand), it splits the line into tokens (`line.split()`).
4. It then calculates the number of duplicate tokens in the list by subtracting the number of unique tokens (`{*tokens}`) from the total number of tokens (`len(tokens)`).
5. Finally, it prints the result, which represents the maximum number of points the player can score.

The program's logic is correct because it accurately implements the strategy for maximizing the player's score. By counting the number of duplicate cards in the player's hand, the program effectively determines the number of opportunities the player has to score points.

Correctness: **True**
