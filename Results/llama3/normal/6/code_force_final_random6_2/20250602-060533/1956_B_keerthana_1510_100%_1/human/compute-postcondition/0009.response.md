Output State: **`stdin` contains a multiple of 2 plus 1 lines, `line` is the last line, and the difference between the number of tokens in the last line and the number of unique tokens in the last line is being printed.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the input (`stdin`) will have been fully processed, and the last line will have been read and processed. The loop will print the difference between the total number of tokens ( integers ) in the last line and the number of unique tokens in that line.
