Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. The problem asks to find the maximum number of points that can be scored by taking turns optimally, given the cards in the player's hand. The program achieves this by counting the number of duplicate cards in the player's hand, which represents the maximum number of points that can be scored.

The program uses the following logic:

1. It reads the input from the standard input, skipping the first two lines (which contain the number of test cases and the number of cards).
2. It splits each line into tokens (cards) and stores them in the `tokens` variable.
3. It uses the `set` data structure to remove duplicates from the tokens, effectively counting the number of unique cards.
4. It subtracts the number of unique cards from the total number of cards to get the number of duplicate cards, which represents the maximum number of points that can be scored.
5. It prints the result.

This logic is correct because it accurately implements the problem's requirements. The program correctly counts the number of duplicate cards in the player's hand, which represents the maximum number of points that can be scored.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program handles all possible inputs correctly, including edge cases such as an empty input or a single card in the player's hand. Therefore, the program is correct.
