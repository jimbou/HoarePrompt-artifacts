Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. The program reads input from standard input (`stdin`) using `open(0)`. The `[2::2]` slice notation is used to read every other line starting from the third line (index 2). This is because each test case consists of two lines, and we're only interested in the second line of each test case.

2. For each line read, the program splits the line into tokens ( integers ) using the `split()` method and stores them in the `tokens` variable.

3. The program then calculates the difference between the total number of tokens (`len(tokens)`) and the number of unique tokens (`len({*tokens})`). This difference represents the maximum number of points that can be scored by the player.

4. Finally, the program prints the calculated difference for each test case.

The program's logic is correct because it accurately implements the strategy for maximizing the player's score. By counting the number of duplicate integers in the player's hand, the program effectively determines the maximum number of points that can be scored.

Correctness: **True**
