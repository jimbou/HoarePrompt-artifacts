According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable stack. If stack is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, stack is empty. So for the loop to be executed one more time stack must not be empty.
State: **tree is a Tree object, s is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree, x is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, stack is not empty, v is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree and is equal to s, postorder is assigned the value popped from the stack, tree.vertices[v].children is empty, u is the last child of v. If tree.vertices[u].remaining_size is greater than or equal to x, then tree.vertices[v].good_components is increased by tree.vertices[u].good_components plus one. Otherwise, tree.vertices[v].good_components is increased by tree.vertices[u].good_components and tree.vertices[v].remaining_size is increased by tree.vertices[u].remaining_size.**
