Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object, `s` is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` has the same number of elements as the number of children of the root of the tree minus one, `v` is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree and is equal to `s`, `postorder` is assigned the value popped from the stack, `tree.vertices[v].children` has at least one child, `u` is the third child of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by 1**

In this output state, the value of `tree.vertices[v].good_components` has been increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The `tree` object still represents the tree, `s` and `v` still represent the root of the tree, `x` still represents the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` still has the same number of elements as the number of children of the root of the tree minus one, `postorder` still holds the value popped from the stack, and `u` is still the third child of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children`.
