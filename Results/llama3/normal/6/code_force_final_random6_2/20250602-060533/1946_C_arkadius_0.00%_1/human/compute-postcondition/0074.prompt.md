Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tree` is a Tree object, `s` is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is not empty and contains the tuple `(v, True)` at the top, `v` is assigned the value popped from the stack, `postorder` is assigned the value popped from the stack, `tree.vertices[v].children` is empty, `u` is the last child of `v`. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components` plus one. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components` and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size.
Code of the loop:
for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
    stack.append((u, False))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tree` is a Tree object, `s` is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is not empty and contains the tuple `(u, False)` at the top and the tuple `(v, True)` below it, `v` is assigned the value popped from the stack, `postorder` is assigned the value popped from the stack, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least 1 child, `u` is the first child of `v`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tree` is a Tree object, `s` is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` contains the tuple `(u, False)` at the top and the tuple `(u, False)` below it and the tuple `(v, True)` below it, `v` is assigned the value popped from the stack, `postorder` is assigned the value popped from the stack, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least 2 children, `u` is the second child of `v`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `tree` is a Tree object, `s` is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` contains the tuple `(u, False)` at the top, the tuple `(u, False)` below it, the tuple `(v, True)` below it and the tuple `(u, False)` below it, `v` is assigned the value popped from the stack, `postorder` is assigned the value popped from the stack, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least 3 children, `u` is the third child of `v`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
