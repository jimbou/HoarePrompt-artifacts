Postcondition: ***`tree` is a tree data structure with `n` vertices, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= k < n`. If `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returns True, then `beg` is set to `mid`, and `mid` is updated to the average of `mid` and `end` rounded up to the nearest integer. Otherwise, `beg` remains less than `mid`, and `mid` is updated to the average of `beg` and `mid - 1` rounded up to the nearest integer, and `end` is set to `mid - 1`.***
