Output State: **tree is a Tree object, s is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree, x is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, stack is empty, v is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree and is equal to s, postorder is assigned the value popped from the stack, tree.vertices[v].children is empty, u is the last child of v. If tree.vertices[u].remaining_size is greater than or equal to x, then tree.vertices[v].good_components is increased by tree.vertices[u].good_components plus one. Otherwise, tree.vertices[v].good_components is increased by tree.vertices[u].good_components and tree.vertices[v].remaining_size is increased by tree.vertices[u].remaining_size.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: The loop has finished executing, and the stack is empty. The value of `v` remains the same as the root of the tree, and `postorder` is assigned the last value popped from the stack. The children of `v` have been fully traversed, and `u` is the last child of `v`. The `good_components` and `remaining_size` of `v` have been updated based on the values of its children.
