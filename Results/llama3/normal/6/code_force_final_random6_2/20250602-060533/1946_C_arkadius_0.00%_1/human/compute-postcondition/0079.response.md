Postcondition: **The tree object is updated based on the postorder traversal, the postorder is not empty, the tree remains unchanged, `tree.vertices[v].children` is a list of children that must have at least 1 child, `u` is the first child in the list, and `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components`. The current value of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`.**
