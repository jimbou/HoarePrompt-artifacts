Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from a tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x.

The program uses a binary search approach to find the maximum value of x. It starts by initializing the search range to [1, n], where n is the number of vertices in the tree. It then iteratively checks if it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree such that the size of each remaining connected component is at least the current mid value.

The program uses a recursive function (func_2) to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the subtree rooted at a given vertex. A good component is a subtree with a size greater than or equal to x. The function returns a tuple containing the number of good components and the remaining size of the subtree.

The program also uses a non-recursive function (func_1) to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the entire tree. This function uses a stack to perform a post-order traversal of the tree.

The program checks if it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree such that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x by calling func_3. This function checks if the number of good components is greater than k or if the number of good components is equal to k and the remaining size is greater than or equal to x.

If the program finds that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree such that the size of each remaining connected component is at least the current mid value, it updates the search range to [mid + 1, end]. Otherwise, it updates the search range to [beg, mid - 1].

The program repeats this process until the search range contains only one value, which is the maximum value of x.

Correctness: **True**
