It recursively traverses the tree, starting from a given vertex, and aggregates the good components and remaining sizes from its subtrees. The function returns a tuple containing the total number of good components and the total remaining size, which is the sum of 1 and the sizes of all subtrees with a size less than the minimum size.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines the largest integer value 'mid' such that the function func_3(tree, n, k, mid) returns True, given a tree data structure with 'n' vertices and a non-negative integer 'k' representing the number of edges to be removed. It performs a binary search to find this value, iteratively adjusting the search range until it converges on the largest valid 'mid' value. The function returns this largest valid 'mid' value.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that k < n, and the input is in the format of a tree with n vertices, where each vertex is connected to at least one other vertex, and the edges are represented as pairs of vertices (u, v) where 1 <= u, v <= n.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function constructs a tree from input data, where the number of vertices (n) and edges (k) are provided, and each edge is represented as a pair of vertices. It then applies the func_4 function to the constructed tree, n, and k, and prints the result. The function assumes that the input is well-formed, with n and k being positive integers and k being less than n, and that the tree can be successfully constructed from the input edges. The final state of the program is the output of the func_4 function, which is printed to the console.
