Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 2, k is a positive integer less than n, tree is a tree with n vertices and two additional edges between vertices u-1 and v-1, i is 2, u and v are integers equal to the two integers from the input**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables u and v. The second line adds an edge between the vertices u-1 and v-1 to the tree. 

Since n is a positive integer greater than 2 and k is a positive integer less than n, these values remain unchanged. The tree initially has n vertices and an additional edge between vertices u-1 and v-1. After the code executes, the tree still has n vertices but now has two additional edges between vertices u-1 and v-1. The value of i remains 2. The values of u and v are updated to the two integers read from the input.
