Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object, `s` is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is not empty but its size is decreased by one, `v` is assigned the value popped from the stack, `postorder` is assigned the value popped from the stack, `tree.vertices[v].children` is empty, `u` is the last child of `v`. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components` plus one. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components` and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size.**

In this output state, the value of `v` and `postorder` has been updated to the value popped from the stack. The size of the stack has been decreased by one. The values of the other variables are not affected.
