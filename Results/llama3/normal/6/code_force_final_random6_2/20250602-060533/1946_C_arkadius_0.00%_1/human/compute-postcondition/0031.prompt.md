Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`tree` is a Tree object, `s` is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is a list containing tuples with non-negative integers as the first element and boolean values as the second element and stack must not be empty, `v` is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree and is equal to `s`. The current value of `postorder` is `True`.
Code of the loop:
for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
    tree.vertices[v].good_components += tree.vertices[u].good_components
    if tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x:
        tree.vertices[v].good_components += 1
    else:
        tree.vertices[v].remaining_size += tree.vertices[u].remaining_size


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`tree` is a Tree object, `s` is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is a list containing tuples with non-negative integers as the first element and boolean values as the second element and stack must not be empty, `v` is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree and is equal to `s`, `postorder` is `True`, `tree.vertices[v].children` must not be empty, `u` is the first child of `v`. If the remaining size of vertex `u` is greater than or equal to `x`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by 1 plus the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components`. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components` and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`tree` is a Tree object, `s` is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is a list containing tuples with non-negative integers as the first element and boolean values as the second element and stack must not be empty, `v` is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree and is equal to `s`, `postorder` is `True`, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least 2 children, `u` is the second child of `v`. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components` and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`tree` is a Tree object, `s` is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is a list containing tuples with non-negative integers as the first element and boolean values as the second element and stack must not be empty, `v` is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree and is equal to `s`, `postorder` is `True`, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least 3 children, `u` is the third child of `v`. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components` and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
