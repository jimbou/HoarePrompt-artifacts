Reasoning: 
The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from a tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x. The program uses a binary search approach to find the maximum value of x.

The program first constructs a tree data structure from the input edges and then performs a postorder traversal of the tree to calculate the size of each subtree and the number of good components (subtrees with size at least x) for each vertex.

The program then uses a binary search approach to find the maximum value of x. It starts with a range of possible values for x (from 1 to n) and repeatedly checks if it is possible to remove exactly k edges to get a tree with all components of size at least x. If it is possible, it updates the lower bound of the range; otherwise, it updates the upper bound.

The program uses a helper function (func_3) to check if it is possible to remove exactly k edges to get a tree with all components of size at least x. This function calculates the number of good components and the total size of the remaining components and checks if the number of good components is greater than k or if the number of good components is equal to k and the total size of the remaining components is at least x.

The program finally prints the maximum value of x found by the binary search.

Correctness: **True**
