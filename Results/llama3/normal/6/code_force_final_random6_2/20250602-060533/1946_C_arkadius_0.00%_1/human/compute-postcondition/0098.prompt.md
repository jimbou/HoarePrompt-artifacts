You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: tree is a Tree object, s is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree, and x is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each connected component.
    stack = [(s, False)]
    while stack:
        v, postorder = stack.pop()
        
        if not postorder:
            stack.append((v, True))
            for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
                stack.append((u, False))
        
        if postorder:
            for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
                tree.vertices[v].good_components += tree.vertices[u].good_components
                if tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x:
                    tree.vertices[v].good_components += 1
                else:
                    tree.vertices[v].remaining_size += tree.vertices[u].remaining_size
        
    #State: The tree object is updated based on the postorder traversal. The stack is empty. The good components of each vertex are increased by the sum of the good components of its children and by 1 for each child whose remaining size is greater than or equal to x. The remaining size of each vertex is increased by the sum of the remaining sizes of its children whose remaining size is less than x.
    return tree.vertices[s].good_components, tree.vertices[s].remaining_size
    #The program returns a tuple containing the total good components and the remaining size of vertex s in the tree. The total good components include the sum of good components of its children and 1 for each child whose remaining size is greater than or equal to x. The remaining size is the sum of the remaining sizes of its children whose remaining size is less than x.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a tuple containing the total good components and the remaining size of vertex s in the tree. The total good components include the sum of good components of its children and 1 for each child whose remaining size is greater than or equal to x. The remaining size is the sum of the remaining sizes of its children whose remaining size is less than x.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
