Output State: **`tree` is a tree data structure with `n` vertices, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= k < n`, `beg` is less than `mid`, `mid` is an integer equal to the average of `beg` and `mid - 1` rounded up to the nearest integer, and `end` is equal to `mid - 1`.**

In this output state, the value of `end` has been updated to `mid - 1`, which is a specific value. The other variables remain unchanged, and their relationships and properties are still valid. The tree data structure, the number of vertices, and the range of `k` are unaffected by the code. The relationship between `beg`, `mid`, and `end` has been updated to reflect the new value of `end`.
