Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object, `s` is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is not empty and contains the tuple `(u, False)` at the top and the tuple `(v, True)` below it, `v` is assigned the value popped from the stack, `postorder` is assigned the value popped from the stack, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least 1 child, `u` is the first child of `v`**

In this output state, the stack now contains the tuple `(u, False)` at the top, indicating that `u` is being processed and has not been fully visited yet. The tuple `(v, True)` is below it, indicating that `v` has been fully visited. The other variables remain unchanged.
