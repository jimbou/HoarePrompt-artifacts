Output State: *`tree` is a Tree object, `s` is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is a list containing tuples with non-negative integers as the first element and boolean values as the second element and stack must not be empty, `v` is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree and is equal to `s`, `postorder` is `True`, `tree.vertices[v].children` must be empty, `u` is not defined. `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by the sum of `tree.vertices[u].good_components` for all children `u` of `v`. For each child `u` of `v`, if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by the sum of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` for all children `u` of `v`.*

In natural language, after the loop executes all iterations, the output state will have the same values for `tree`, `s`, `x`, `stack`, and `postorder` as in the initial state. The value of `v` will still be equal to `s`. The `children` list of `tree.vertices[v]` will be empty, indicating that all children of `v` have been processed. The value of `u` will not be defined, as it is no longer needed. The `good_components` attribute of `tree.vertices[v]` will be increased by the sum of `good_components` of all children of `v`, plus 1 for each child whose `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`. The `remaining_size` attribute of `tree.vertices[v]` will be increased by the sum of `remaining_size` of all children of `v` whose `remaining_size` is less than `x`.
