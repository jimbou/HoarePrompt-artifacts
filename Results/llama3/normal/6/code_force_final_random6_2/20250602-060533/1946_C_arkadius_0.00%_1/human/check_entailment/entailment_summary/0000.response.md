Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from a tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x.

The program consists of multiple functions, each with a specific purpose:

1. `func_1`: This function calculates and returns the total number of good components and the remaining size of a given vertex in a tree, based on a minimum size requirement for each connected component. It updates the tree object by traversing it in postorder and aggregating the good components and remaining sizes of each vertex's children.

2. `func_2`: This function calculates and returns the total number of good components and the remaining size in a tree, where a good component is a subtree with a size greater than or equal to a specified minimum size. It recursively traverses the tree, starting from a given vertex, and aggregates the good components and remaining sizes from its subtrees.

3. `func_3`: This function determines if a tree with n vertices has at least k connected components with a minimum size of x, or if the total size of components with size less than x is at least x when the number of such components is equal to k.

4. `func_4`: This function determines the largest integer value 'mid' such that the function `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returns True, given a tree data structure with 'n' vertices and a non-negative integer 'k' representing the number of edges to be removed. It performs a binary search to find this value, iteratively adjusting the search range until it converges on the largest valid 'mid' value.

5. `func_5`: This function constructs a tree from input data, where the number of vertices (n) and edges (k) are provided, and each edge is represented as a pair of vertices. It then applies the `func_4` function to the constructed tree, n, and k, and prints the result.

The program correctly implements the required functionality by using a combination of these functions. The `func_5` function is the main entry point, which constructs the tree and applies the `func_4` function to find the maximum number x. The `func_4` function uses a binary search approach to find the largest valid 'mid' value, and the `func_3` function checks if the tree meets the required conditions for a given 'mid' value. The `func_1` and `func_2` functions are used to calculate the good components and remaining sizes of the tree, which are used in the `func_3` function.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the problem requirements.
