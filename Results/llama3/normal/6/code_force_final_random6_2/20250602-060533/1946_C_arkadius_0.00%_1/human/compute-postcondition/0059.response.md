Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object, `s` is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` has the same number of elements as the number of children of the root of the tree minus one, `v` is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree and is equal to `s`, `postorder` is assigned the value popped from the stack, `tree.vertices[v].children` has at least one child, `u` is the third child of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components`**.

In natural language, the output state is: The tree object remains unchanged, the root of the tree is still represented by the non-negative integer `s`, the minimum size of each connected component is still represented by the non-negative integer `x`, the stack still has the same number of elements as the number of children of the root of the tree minus one, the root of the tree is still represented by the non-negative integer `v` which is equal to `s`, the postorder is still assigned the value popped from the stack, the children of the root of the tree are still at least one, the third child of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children` is still `u`, and the good components of the vertex `v` in the tree are increased by the good components of the vertex `u`.
