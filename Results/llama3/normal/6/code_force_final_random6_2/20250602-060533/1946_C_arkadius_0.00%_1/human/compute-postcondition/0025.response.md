Postcondition: ***`tree` is a Tree object, `s` is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is a list containing tuples with non-negative integers as the first element and boolean values as the second element and stack must not be empty, `v` is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree and is equal to `s`, `postorder` is `True`, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least 2 children, `u` is the second child of `v`. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components` and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.***
