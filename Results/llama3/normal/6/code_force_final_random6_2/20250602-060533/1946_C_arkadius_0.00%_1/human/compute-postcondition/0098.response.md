Functionality: **This function calculates and returns the total number of good components and the remaining size of a given vertex in a tree, based on a minimum size requirement for each connected component. It updates the tree object by traversing it in postorder and aggregating the good components and remaining sizes of each vertex's children. The function takes a tree object, a root vertex, and a minimum size requirement as input, and returns a tuple containing the total good components and the remaining size of the root vertex.**
