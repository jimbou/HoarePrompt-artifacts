Functionality: **This function constructs a tree from input data, where the number of vertices (n) and edges (k) are provided, and each edge is represented as a pair of vertices. It then applies the func_4 function to the constructed tree, n, and k, and prints the result. The function assumes that the input is well-formed, with n and k being positive integers and k being less than n, and that the tree can be successfully constructed from the input edges. The final state of the program is the output of the func_4 function, which is printed to the console.**
