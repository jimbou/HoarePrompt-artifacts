Postcondition: ***`tree` is a tree data structure with `n` vertices, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= k < n`. If `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` is true, then `mid` is an integer equal to the average of `mid` and `end` rounded up to the nearest integer, and `beg` is an integer equal to the average of `mid` and `end` rounded up to the nearest integer. Otherwise, `mid` is an integer equal to the average of `beg` and `end` rounded up to the nearest integer, and `end` is equal to `mid - 1`.***
