Postcondition: ***`tree` is a Tree object, `s` is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is a list containing tuples with non-negative integers as the first element and boolean values as the second element and stack must not be empty, `v` is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree and is equal to `s`. If `postorder` is `False`, then the function returns `tree`. If `postorder` is `True`, then `tree.vertices[v].children` must be empty, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by the sum of `tree.vertices[u].good_components` for all children `u` of `v` and by 1 for each child `u` of `v` whose `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`. `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by the sum of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` for all children `u` of `v` whose `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is less than `x`.***
