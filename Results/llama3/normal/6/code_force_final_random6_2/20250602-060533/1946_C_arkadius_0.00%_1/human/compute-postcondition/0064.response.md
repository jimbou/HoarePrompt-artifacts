Postcondition: ***tree is a Tree object, s is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree, x is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each connected component. If postorder is not empty, stack is empty, v is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree and is equal to s, postorder is assigned the value popped from the stack, tree.vertices[v].children is empty, u is the last child of v. If tree.vertices[u].remaining_size is greater than or equal to x, then tree.vertices[v].good_components is increased by tree.vertices[u].good_components plus one. Otherwise, tree.vertices[v].good_components is increased by tree.vertices[u].good_components and tree.vertices[v].remaining_size is increased by tree.vertices[u].remaining_size. If postorder is empty, no changes are made.***
