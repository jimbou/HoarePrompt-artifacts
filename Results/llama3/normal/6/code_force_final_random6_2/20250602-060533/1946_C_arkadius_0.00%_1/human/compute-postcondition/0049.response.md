Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object, `s` is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` has the same number of elements as the number of children of the root of the tree, `v` is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree and is equal to `s`, `postorder` is assigned the value popped from the stack, `tree.vertices[v].children` has at least one child, `u` is the first child of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components` plus one, and the current value of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The tree object and its properties remain the same, except that the number of good components in the vertex `v` is increased by one, in addition to the good components of its child `u`. The stack, the root of the tree, the minimum size of each connected component, and the remaining size of the child `u` remain unchanged.
