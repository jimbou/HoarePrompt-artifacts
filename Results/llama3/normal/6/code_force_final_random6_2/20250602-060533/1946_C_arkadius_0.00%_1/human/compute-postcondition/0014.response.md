Output State: **`tree` is a tree data structure with `n` vertices, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= k < n`, `beg` is less than `mid`, `mid` is an integer equal to the average of `beg` and `end` rounded up to the nearest integer, and `end` is equal to `mid - 1` or `end` is greater than `mid`**.

In this output state, the value of `mid` has been updated to be the average of `beg` and `end` rounded up to the nearest integer, which is calculated as `(beg + end + 1) // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `beg`, `mid`, and `end` is maintained, with `beg` being less than `mid`, and `end` being either equal to `mid - 1` or greater than `mid`.
