Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object, `s` is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` contains the tuple `(u, False)` at the top, the tuple `(u, False)` below it, the tuple `(v, True)` below it and the tuple `(u, False)` below it, `v` is assigned the value popped from the stack, `postorder` is assigned the value popped from the stack, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least 3 children, `u` is the third child of `v`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The tree object and the values of `s` and `x` remain unchanged. The stack now has an additional tuple `(u, False)` at the top, with the previous tuples `(u, False)` and `(v, True)` below it. The values of `v` and `postorder` are still assigned the value popped from the stack. The tree's vertices and children relationships remain the same, with `u` being the third child of `v`.
