Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: tree is a Tree object, s is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree, x is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, stack has the same number of elements as the number of children of the root of the tree plus one, v is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree and is equal to s, postorder is assigned the value popped from the stack, v is assigned the value popped from the stack which is equal to s. The current value of postorder is not empty, tree.vertices[v].children is not empty and has been fully traversed, and u is the last child of v.
Code of the loop:
for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
    tree.vertices[v].good_components += tree.vertices[u].good_components
    if tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x:
        tree.vertices[v].good_components += 1
    else:
        tree.vertices[v].remaining_size += tree.vertices[u].remaining_size


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`tree` is a Tree object, `s` is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` has the same number of elements as the number of children of the root of the tree, `v` is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree and is equal to `s`, `postorder` is assigned the value popped from the stack, `tree.vertices[v].children` has at least one child, `u` is the first child of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children`. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components` plus one. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components`, and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`tree` is a Tree object, `s` is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` has the same number of elements as the number of children of the root of the tree minus one, `v` is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree and is equal to `s`, `postorder` is assigned the value popped from the stack, `tree.vertices[v].children` has at least one child, `u` is the second child of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children`. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components` plus one. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components` and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`tree` is a Tree object, `s` is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` has the same number of elements as the number of children of the root of the tree minus one, `v` is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree and is equal to `s`, `postorder` is assigned the value popped from the stack, `tree.vertices[v].children` has at least one child, `u` is the third child of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children`. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components` and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
