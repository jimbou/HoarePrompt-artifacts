Output State: **`tree` is a tree data structure with `n` vertices, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= k < n`, `beg` is equal to `mid`, `mid` is an integer equal to the average of `mid` and `end` rounded up to the nearest integer, and `end` is equal to `mid - 1` or `end` is greater than `mid`.**

In this output state, the value of `beg` has been updated to be equal to `mid`, while the other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `mid` and `end` is still valid, and `mid` is still the average of `mid` and `end` rounded up to the nearest integer.
