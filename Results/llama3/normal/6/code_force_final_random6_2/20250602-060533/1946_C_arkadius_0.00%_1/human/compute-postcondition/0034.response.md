According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable stack.  If stack is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, stack must not be empty, So for the loop to be executed one more time stack must not be empty.
State: **`tree` is a Tree object, `s` is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` must not be empty, `v` is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree and is equal to `s`.**
