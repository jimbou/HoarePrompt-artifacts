Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. 

One case where the program does not work correctly is when the tree has a vertex with more than two children. In this case, the program does not correctly calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the subtree rooted at that vertex.

For example, consider a tree with 5 vertices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. The edges are (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4). If we want to remove 1 edge, the program should return 2, because we can remove the edge (0, 1) and get two connected components of size 2 and 3. However, the program returns 1, because it incorrectly calculates the number of good components and the remaining size of the subtree rooted at vertex 0.

The problem is in the function func_2, where it does not correctly handle the case when a vertex has more than two children. It only checks the remaining size of the subtree rooted at each child, but it does not check the remaining size of the subtree rooted at the current vertex. This causes the program to incorrectly calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the subtree rooted at the current vertex.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the Correctness is **False**.
