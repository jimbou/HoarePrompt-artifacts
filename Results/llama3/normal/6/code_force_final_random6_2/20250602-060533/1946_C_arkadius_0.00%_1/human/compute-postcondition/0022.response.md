Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object, `s` is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is a list containing tuples with non-negative integers as the first element and boolean values as the second element and stack must not be empty, `v` is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree and is equal to `s`, `postorder` is `True`, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least 2 children, `u` is the second child of `v`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components`.**

In this output state, the value of `tree.vertices[v].good_components` has been updated by adding the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components` to it. The other variables remain unchanged, and their properties and relationships are still valid. The tree structure and the stack remain the same, and the values of `s`, `x`, `v`, and `postorder` are unchanged.
