Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 2, k is a positive integer less than n, tree is a tree with n vertices and three additional edges between vertices u-1 and v-1, i is 3, u and v are integers equal to the two integers from the input**

The code snippet first reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `u` and `v`. Then, it adds an edge between the vertices `u-1` and `v-1` to the tree. The values of `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged. The tree now has three additional edges between the vertices `u-1` and `v-1`.
