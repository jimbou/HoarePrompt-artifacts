Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer less than n, tree is a tree with n vertices**.

The first line assigns the values of `n` and `k` from the input, which are positive integers such that `k` is less than `n`. The second line creates a tree with `n` vertices. The initial state's condition that `k` is less than `n` is still valid after the code execution. The tree is created with `n` vertices, but no edges are added yet.
