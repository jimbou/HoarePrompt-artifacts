Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object, `s` is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is a list containing tuples with non-negative integers as the first element and boolean values as the second element and stack must not be empty, `v` is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree and is equal to `s`, `postorder` is `True`, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least 3 children, `u` is the third child of `v`, and `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `tree.vertices[v].good_components` has been incremented by 1, indicating that the number of good components in the subtree rooted at `v` has increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their original values and properties.
