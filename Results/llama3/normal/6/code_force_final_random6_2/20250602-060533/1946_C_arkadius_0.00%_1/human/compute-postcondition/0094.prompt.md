Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The tree object is updated based on the postorder traversal. The postorder is not empty. If the postorder is not empty, the tree remains unchanged. If the postorder is empty, the tree's vertices are updated as follows: for each vertex v, if the remaining size of its last child u is greater than or equal to x, the good components of v are increased by the good components of u plus one. Otherwise, the good components of v are increased by the good components of u, and the remaining size of v is increased by the remaining size of u. The current value of the postorder is not empty.
Code of the loop:
for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
    tree.vertices[v].good_components += tree.vertices[u].good_components
    if tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x:
        tree.vertices[v].good_components += 1
    else:
        tree.vertices[v].remaining_size += tree.vertices[u].remaining_size


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *The tree object is updated based on the postorder traversal, the postorder is not empty, the tree remains unchanged, `tree.vertices[v].children` is a list of children that must have at least 1 child, `u` is the first child in the list. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components` and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` which is less than `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *The tree object is updated based on the postorder traversal, the postorder is not empty, the tree remains unchanged, `tree.vertices[v].children` is a list of children that must have at least 2 children, `u` is the second child in the list. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components` and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *The tree object is updated based on the postorder traversal, the postorder is not empty, the tree remains unchanged, `tree.vertices[v].children` is a list of children that must have at least 3 children, `u` is the third child in the list. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components` and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
