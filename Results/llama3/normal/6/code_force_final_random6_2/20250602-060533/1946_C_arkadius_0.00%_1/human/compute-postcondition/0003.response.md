The only variable in the loop head is variable i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i and n. If i is less than n, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is 1, n is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, i must be increased by 1, so i is 2 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 2.
State: **n is a positive integer greater than 2, k is a positive integer less than n, tree is a tree with n vertices and an additional edge between vertices u-1 and v-1, i is 2, u and v are integers**
