Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object, `s` is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` has the same number of elements as the number of children of the root of the tree minus one, `v` is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree and is equal to `s`, `postorder` is assigned the value popped from the stack, `tree.vertices[v].children` has at least one child, `u` is the first child of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components`, and the remaining size of `tree.vertices[u]` is less than `x`, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`**.

In natural language, the output state is: The tree object remains unchanged, the root of the tree represented by `s` and `v` remains the same, the minimum size of each connected component `x` remains the same, the stack has one less element, the postorder is assigned the value popped from the stack, the children of the root of the tree remain the same, the first child of the root `u` remains the same, the good components of the root are increased by the good components of the first child, the remaining size of the first child is still less than the minimum size, and the remaining size of the root is increased by the remaining size of the first child.
