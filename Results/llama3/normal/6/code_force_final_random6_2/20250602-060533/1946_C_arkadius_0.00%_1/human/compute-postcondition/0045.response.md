Postcondition: **tree is a Tree object, s is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree, x is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, stack has the same number of elements as the number of children of the root of the tree plus one, v is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree and is equal to s, postorder is assigned the value popped from the stack, v is assigned the value popped from the stack which is equal to s. The current value of postorder is not empty, tree.vertices[v].children is not empty and has been fully traversed, and u is the last child of v.**
