Postcondition: ***The tree object is updated based on the postorder traversal, the postorder is not empty, the tree remains unchanged, `tree.vertices[v].children` is a list of children that must have at least 2 children, `u` is the second child in the list. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components` and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size.***
