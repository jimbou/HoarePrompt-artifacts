Postcondition: **The tree object is updated based on the postorder traversal. If the postorder is not empty, the tree remains unchanged. If the postorder is empty, the tree's vertices are updated as follows: for each vertex v, if the remaining size of its last child u is greater than or equal to x, the good components of v are increased by the good components of u plus one. Otherwise, the good components of v are increased by the good components of u, and the remaining size of v is increased by the remaining size of u.**
