Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object, `s` is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` has the same number of elements as the number of children of the root of the tree minus one, `v` is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree and is equal to `s`, `postorder` is assigned the value popped from the stack, `tree.vertices[v].children` has at least one child, `u` is the second child of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components`, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The tree object and its properties remain unchanged, except for the `remaining_size` of the vertex `v`, which is increased by the `remaining_size` of its second child `u`. The other variables, such as `s`, `x`, `stack`, `postorder`, and the `good_components` of vertex `v`, retain their previous values.
