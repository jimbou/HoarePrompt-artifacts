Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object, `s` is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` has three more elements than before, `v` is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree and is equal to `s`, `postorder` is assigned the value popped from the stack, `v` is assigned the value popped from the stack which is equal to `s`, `tree.vertices[v].children` is not empty and has at least one more child, `u` is the next child of `v`, and `(u, False)` is appended to the stack.**

In natural language, the output state is: The tree object remains unchanged, the root of the tree is still represented by the non-negative integer `s`, the minimum size of each connected component is still represented by the non-negative integer `x`, the stack now has three more elements than before, the root of the tree is still represented by the non-negative integer `v` which is equal to `s`, the postorder is still assigned the value popped from the stack, `v` is still assigned the value popped from the stack which is equal to `s`, the children of the vertex `v` in the tree are not empty and have at least one more child, `u` is still the next child of `v`, and the tuple `(u, False)` is added to the stack.
