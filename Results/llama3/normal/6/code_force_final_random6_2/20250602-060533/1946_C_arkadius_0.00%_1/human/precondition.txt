stdin contains multiple sets of inputs. Each set of input data contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) on the first line, followed by a description of the sets of input data. The first line of each set of input data contains two integers n and k (1 <= k < n <= 10^5) â€” the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges to be removed. Each of the next n - 1 lines of each set of input data contains two integers v and u (1 <= v, u <= n) â€” the next edge of the tree.
