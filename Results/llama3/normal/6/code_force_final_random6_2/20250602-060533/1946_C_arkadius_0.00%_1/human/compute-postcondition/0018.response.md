Output State: **beg = end = the largest integer mid such that func_3(tree, n, k, mid) is True**.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `beg` and `end` will be equal to the largest integer `mid` for which `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returns `True`. This means that the loop will continue to narrow down the range of possible values for `mid` until it finds the largest value that satisfies the condition `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)`. At this point, `beg` and `end` will be equal, indicating that the loop has converged to the desired value.
