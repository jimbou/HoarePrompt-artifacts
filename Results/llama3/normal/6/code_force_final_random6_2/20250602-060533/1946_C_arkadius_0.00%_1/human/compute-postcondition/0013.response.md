To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `beg` and `end` so that `beg` is still less than `end`.

According to the given conditions, if `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` is true, then `mid` is an integer equal to the average of `mid` and `end` rounded up to the nearest integer, and `beg` is an integer equal to the average of `mid` and `end` rounded up to the nearest integer. Otherwise, `mid` is an integer equal to the average of `beg` and `end` rounded up to the nearest integer, and `end` is equal to `mid - 1`.

In both cases, we can see that `mid` is always less than or equal to `end`. To ensure `beg` is less than `end`, we need to adjust `beg` to be less than `mid`.

State: **`tree` is a tree data structure with `n` vertices, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= k < n`, `beg` is less than `mid`, `mid` is an integer equal to the average of `mid` and `end` rounded up to the nearest integer or `mid` is an integer equal to the average of `beg` and `end` rounded up to the nearest integer, and `end` is equal to `mid - 1` or `end` is greater than `mid`**
