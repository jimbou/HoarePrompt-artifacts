To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n`. Since `n` is already a positive integer, we just need to ensure it's greater than 1.

The variable `i` will take values from 1 to `n-1`, so we can set its initial value to 1.

The states of `k` and `tree` are not relevant to the loop execution, so we don't need to adjust them.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer less than `n`, `tree` is a tree with `n` vertices, `i` is 1**
