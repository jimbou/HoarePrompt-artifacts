Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tree` is a Tree object, `s` is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is a list containing a tuple with `s` as the first element and `False` as the second element.
Code of the loop:
while stack:
    v, postorder = stack.pop()
    if not postorder:
        stack.append((v, True))
        for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
            stack.append((u, False))
    if postorder:
        for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
            tree.vertices[v].good_components += tree.vertices[u
                ].good_components
            if tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x:
                tree.vertices[v].good_components += 1
            else:
                tree.vertices[v].remaining_size += tree.vertices[u
                    ].remaining_size


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`tree` is a Tree object, `s` is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is a list containing tuples with non-negative integers as the first element and boolean values as the second element and stack must not be empty, `v` is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree and is equal to `s`. If `postorder` is `False`, then the function returns `tree`. If `postorder` is `True`, then `tree.vertices[v].children` must be empty, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by the sum of `tree.vertices[u].good_components` for all children `u` of `v` and by 1 for each child `u` of `v` whose `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`. `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by the sum of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` for all children `u` of `v` whose `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is less than `x`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *tree is a Tree object, s is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree, x is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each connected component. If postorder is not empty, stack is empty, v is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree and is equal to s, postorder is assigned the value popped from the stack, tree.vertices[v].children is empty, u is the last child of v. If tree.vertices[u].remaining_size is greater than or equal to x, then tree.vertices[v].good_components is increased by tree.vertices[u].good_components plus one. Otherwise, tree.vertices[v].good_components is increased by tree.vertices[u].good_components and tree.vertices[v].remaining_size is increased by tree.vertices[u].remaining_size. If postorder is empty, no changes are made.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: The tree object is updated based on the postorder traversal. If the postorder is not empty, the tree remains unchanged. If the postorder is empty, the tree's vertices are updated as follows: for each vertex v, if the remaining size of its last child u is greater than or equal to x, the good components of v are increased by the good components of u plus one. Otherwise, the good components of v are increased by the good components of u, and the remaining size of v is increased by the remaining size of u.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
