Output State: **The tree object is updated based on the postorder traversal, the postorder is not empty, the tree remains unchanged, `tree.vertices[v].children` is a list of children that must have at least 2 children, `u` is the second child in the list, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components`, and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The tree object is still being updated based on the postorder traversal, and the postorder is still not empty. The tree itself remains unchanged. The list of children for the vertex `v` still has at least 2 children, and `u` is still the second child in this list. The number of good components for vertex `v` has been increased by the number of good components of vertex `u`. Additionally, the remaining size of vertex `v` has been increased by the remaining size of vertex `u`.
