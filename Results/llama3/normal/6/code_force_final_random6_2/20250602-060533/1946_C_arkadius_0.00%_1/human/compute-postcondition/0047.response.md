Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object, `s` is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` has the same number of elements as the number of children of the root of the tree, `v` is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree and is equal to `s`, `postorder` is assigned the value popped from the stack, `tree.vertices[v].children` has at least one child, `u` is the first child of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components`**

In natural language, the output state is: The tree object remains unchanged, the root of the tree and the minimum size of each connected component are still the same. The stack has one less element. The root of the tree and the postorder value are still the same. The children of the root of the tree are still the same. The first child of the root is still the same. The number of good components of the root is increased by the number of good components of its first child.
