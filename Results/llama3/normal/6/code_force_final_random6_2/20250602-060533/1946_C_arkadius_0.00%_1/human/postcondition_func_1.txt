This function calculates and returns the total number of good components and the remaining size in a tree, where a good component is a subtree with a size greater than or equal to a specified minimum size. It recursively traverses the tree, starting from a given vertex, and aggregates the good components and remaining sizes from its subtrees. The function returns a tuple containing the total number of good components and the total remaining size, which is the sum of 1 and the sizes of all subtrees with a size less than the minimum size.
