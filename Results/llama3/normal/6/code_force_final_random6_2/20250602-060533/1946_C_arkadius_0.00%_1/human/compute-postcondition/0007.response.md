Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer less than n, tree is a tree with n vertices and n-1 additional edges between vertices u-1 and v-1, i is n-1, u and v are integers equal to the n-1 integers from the input**.

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will be a tree with n vertices and n-1 additional edges between vertices u-1 and v-1, where u and v are integers equal to the n-1 integers from the input. The variable i will be equal to n-1, and the values of n and k will remain unchanged.
