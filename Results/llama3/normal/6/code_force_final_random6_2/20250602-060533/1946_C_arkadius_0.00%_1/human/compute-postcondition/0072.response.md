According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `tree.vertices[v].children`. If the list has at least 3 children the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `tree.vertices[v].children` has at least 2 children, `u` is the second child of `v`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 children and `u` is the third child of `v`.

State: **`tree` is a Tree object, `s` is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` contains the tuple `(u, False)` at the top and the tuple `(u, False)` below it and the tuple `(v, True)` below it, `v` is assigned the value popped from the stack, `postorder` is assigned the value popped from the stack, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least 3 children, `u` is the third child of `v`**
