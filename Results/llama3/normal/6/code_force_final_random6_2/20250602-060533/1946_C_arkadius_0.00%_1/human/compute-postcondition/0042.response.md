Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object, `s` is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` has four more elements than before, `v` is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree and is equal to `s`, `postorder` is assigned the value popped from the stack, `v` is assigned the value popped from the stack which is equal to `s`, `tree.vertices[v].children` is not empty and has at least one more child, `u` is the next child of `v`, and `(u, False)` is appended to the stack twice.**

In natural language, the output state is: The tree object remains unchanged, the root of the tree represented by `s` and `v` is still a non-negative integer, the minimum size of each connected component represented by `x` is still a non-negative integer, the stack now has four more elements than before, the root of the tree represented by `v` is still equal to `s`, the postorder is still assigned the value popped from the stack, the root of the tree represented by `v` is still assigned the value popped from the stack which is equal to `s`, the children of the vertex `v` in the tree are not empty and have at least one more child, `u` is still the next child of `v`, and the pair `(u, False)` is now appended to the stack twice.
