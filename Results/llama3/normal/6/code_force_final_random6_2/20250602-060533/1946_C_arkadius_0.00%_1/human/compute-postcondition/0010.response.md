Output: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer less than `n`, `tree` is a tree with `n` vertices and `n-1` additional edges between vertices `u-1` and `v-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `u` and `v` are integers equal to the `n-1` integers from the input, and the root of the tree is set to vertex 0 with parent -1, and the result of the function `func_4` with arguments `tree`, `n`, and `k` is being printed**
