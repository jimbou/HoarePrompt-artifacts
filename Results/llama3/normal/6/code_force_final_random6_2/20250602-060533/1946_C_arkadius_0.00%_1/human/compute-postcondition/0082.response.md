Output State: **The tree object is updated based on the postorder traversal, the postorder is not empty, the tree remains unchanged, `tree.vertices[v].children` is a list of children that must have at least 1 child, `u` is the first child in the list, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components`, and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` which is less than `x`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The tree object is still being updated based on the postorder traversal, and the postorder is still not empty. The tree itself remains unchanged. The list of children for the vertex `v` still has at least one child, and `u` is still the first child in this list. The number of good components for vertex `v` is still increased by the number of good components for vertex `u`. Additionally, the remaining size for vertex `v` is now increased by the remaining size of vertex `u`, which is less than `x`.
