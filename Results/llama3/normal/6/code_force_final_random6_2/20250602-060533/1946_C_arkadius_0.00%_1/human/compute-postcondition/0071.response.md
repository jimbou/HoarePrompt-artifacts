Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object, `s` is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` contains the tuple `(u, False)` at the top and the tuple `(u, False)` below it and the tuple `(v, True)` below it, `v` is assigned the value popped from the stack, `postorder` is assigned the value popped from the stack, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least 2 children, `u` is the second child of `v`**

In this output state, the stack now contains the tuple `(u, False)` at the top, which was appended by the code, and the tuple `(u, False)` below it and the tuple `(v, True)` below it, which were already present in the stack. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
