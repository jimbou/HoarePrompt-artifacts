Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object, `s` is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is a list containing tuples with non-negative integers as the first element and boolean values as the second element and stack must not be empty, `v` is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree and is equal to `s`, `postorder` is `True`, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least 3 children, `u` is the third child of `v`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components`, and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The tree object and its properties remain unchanged, except for the remaining size of the vertex `v`, which is increased by the remaining size of its third child `u`. The stack, postorder flag, and other variables remain unchanged.
