Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object, `s` is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is a list containing tuples with non-negative integers as the first element and boolean values as the second element and stack must not be empty, `v` is a non-negative integer representing the root of the tree and is equal to `s`, `postorder` is `True`, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least 2 children, `u` is the second child of `v`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components`, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.**

In this output state, the code has updated the `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` by adding the value of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` to it. The rest of the variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and properties. The tree structure and its components, including the vertices and their relationships, are preserved.
