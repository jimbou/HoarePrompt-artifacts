Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective frequencies, `first` is False, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. The current value of `i` is not a key in the dictionary `mpp`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `n`, `i`, `arr`, `mpp`, `first`, and `_` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. The current value of `i` is still not a key in the dictionary `mpp`. However, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
