Output State: **`n` is 0, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective frequencies, `first` is True if the frequency of `i` in `arr` is 1, otherwise `first` is False, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `n` will be 0, and the value of `i` will be equal to the initial value of `n`. The list `arr` and the dictionary `mpp` will remain unchanged. The value of `first` will be True if the frequency of `i` in `arr` is 1, otherwise it will be False. The value of `_` will still be 0. The state of `stdin` will also remain unchanged.
