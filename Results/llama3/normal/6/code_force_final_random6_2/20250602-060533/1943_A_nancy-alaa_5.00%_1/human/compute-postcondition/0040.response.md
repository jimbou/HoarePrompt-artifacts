Output State: **n is an integer, i is 0, arr is a list of integers, mpp is a dictionary where keys are elements from arr and values are their respective frequencies, first is False, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to an integer value read from the input. The value of `i` remains 0, as it was initially set to `n` and `n` was 0. The list `arr` now contains a new set of integers read from the input. The dictionary `mpp` has been updated to reflect the frequencies of elements in the new `arr`. The variable `first` has been set to False, indicating that the frequency of `i` in `arr` is not 1. The value of `_` remains 1, as it was not modified by the code. Finally, the number of inputs in `stdin` has been reduced by two, as two inputs were read by the code.
