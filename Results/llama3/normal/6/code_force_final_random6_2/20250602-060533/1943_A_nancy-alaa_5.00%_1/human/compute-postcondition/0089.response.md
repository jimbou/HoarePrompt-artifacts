Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, arr is a list of integers, mpp is a dictionary where keys are elements from arr and values are their respective frequencies, first is True, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs. The current value of `i` is in the keys of `mpp` and the frequency of `i` in `mpp` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `n`, `i`, `arr`, `mpp`, `first`, and `_` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, which means the program will exit the current loop or conditional block. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two inputs.
