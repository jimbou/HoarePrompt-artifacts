The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `stdin`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `stdin`. If `_` is less than the number of test cases in `stdin`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs. So for the loop to be executed one more time `_` is 1 and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one input.
State: **`n` is 0, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective frequencies, `first` is True if the frequency of `i` in `arr` is 1, otherwise `first` is False, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one input**
