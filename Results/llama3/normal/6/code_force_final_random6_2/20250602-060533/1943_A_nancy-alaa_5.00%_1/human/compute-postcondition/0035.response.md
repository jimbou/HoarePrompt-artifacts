Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective frequencies, `first` is True if the frequency of `i` in `arr` is 1, otherwise `first` is False, `_` is 0. If `i` is in `mpp.keys()` and `mpp[i]` is 1 and `first` is True, the function returns `i` which is 2 and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
