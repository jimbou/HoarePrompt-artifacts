Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective frequencies, `first` is False, `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs. If `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
