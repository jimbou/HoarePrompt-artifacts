Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective frequencies, `first` is True if the frequency of `i` in `arr` is 1, otherwise `first` is False, `_` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the value of `i` which is 2 is being returned.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `arr`, `mpp`, `first`, and `_` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still 2, but the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Additionally, the value of `i`, which is 2, is being returned.
