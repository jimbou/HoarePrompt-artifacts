Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective frequencies, `first` is True, `_` is 0. If `i` is in `mpp.keys()` and `mpp[i]` is 1, the function returns `i` which is 2 and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.**

In this output state, the value of `first` has been updated to True. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for returning `i` and breaking out of the loop still depends on whether `i` is in `mpp.keys()` and `mpp[i]` is 1.
