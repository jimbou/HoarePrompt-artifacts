Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective frequencies, `first` is True, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `first` has been updated to True, regardless of its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged, and the program continues with the current state.
