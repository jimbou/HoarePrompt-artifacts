Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective frequencies, `first` is True, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, but does not change the values of any variables. The values of `n`, `i`, `arr`, `mpp`, `first`, and `_` remain the same. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.
