Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective frequencies, `first` is True, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. The current value of `i` is a key in the dictionary `mpp` and the frequency of `i` in `arr` is 1.**

The code only changes the value of the variable `first` to True, leaving all other variables and conditions unchanged.
