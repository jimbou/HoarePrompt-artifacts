Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective frequencies, `first` is True, `_` is 0. If the frequency of `i` in `arr` is 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the value of `i` which is 1 has been printed. Otherwise, no change occurs.**

In this output state, the value of `first` has been updated to True, regardless of the frequency of `i` in `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged. If the frequency of `i` in `arr` is 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement and prints the value of `i`, which is 1. If the frequency of `i` in `arr` is not 1, no change occurs.
