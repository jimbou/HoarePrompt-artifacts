Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective frequencies, `first` is True, `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs. If `i` is in the keys of `mpp` and `mpp[i]` is 1 and `first` is True, then the value of `i` which is 1 is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only difference being that the variable `first` is now explicitly set to True, regardless of its previous value. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
