Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective frequencies, `first` is True if `mpp[i]` is 1, otherwise `first` remains False, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs. If `i` is a key in `mpp` and `mpp[i]` is 1, then `first` is set to True. Otherwise, the program continues with the current state.***
