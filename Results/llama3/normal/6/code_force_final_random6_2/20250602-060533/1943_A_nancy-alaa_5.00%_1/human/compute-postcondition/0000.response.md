The only variables in the loop head are variable `_` and the expression `int(input())`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the expression `int(input())`. If the expression is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains multiple test cases. So for the loop to be executed  the expression `int(input())` must be greater than 0 and `_` is now 0.
State: **`stdin` contains multiple test cases, `_` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
