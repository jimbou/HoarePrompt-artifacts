Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the final score of a game played between Alice and Bob. The game involves picking elements from an array `a` and appending them to another array `c`, with the goal of maximizing the MEX (minimum excludant) of `c`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the elements of the array `arr`.
3. It creates a frequency counter `mpp` using the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each element in the array.
4. It initializes a flag `first` to `False`.
5. It iterates over the range of `n` (from 0 to `n-1`) and checks the following conditions:
	* If the current number `i` is not present in the frequency counter `mpp`, it prints `i` and breaks the loop. This is because the MEX of `c` is the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in `c`, and since `i` is not present in `c`, it is the MEX.
	* If the frequency of `i` in `mpp` is 1 and the flag `first` is `True`, it prints `i` and breaks the loop. This is because if `i` has a frequency of 1 and `first` is `True`, it means that Alice has already picked an element, and Bob's turn will not affect the MEX of `c`.
	* If the frequency of `i` in `mpp` is 1 and the flag `first` is `False`, it sets `first` to `True`. This is because if `i` has a frequency of 1 and `first` is `False`, it means that Alice has not picked an element yet, and Bob's turn will affect the MEX of `c`.

The program's logic is correct because it correctly identifies the MEX of `c` by iterating over the range of `n` and checking the frequency of each element in the array. The use of the `first` flag is also correct, as it helps to determine whether Alice has already picked an element or not.

Correctness: **True**
