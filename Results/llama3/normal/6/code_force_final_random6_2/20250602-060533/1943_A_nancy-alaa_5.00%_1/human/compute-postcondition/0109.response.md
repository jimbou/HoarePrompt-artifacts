Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective frequencies, `first` is True if `mpp[2]` is 1, otherwise `first` remains False, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs. If `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution.***
