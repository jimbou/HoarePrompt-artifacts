Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective frequencies, `first` is True, `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `i`, `arr`, `mpp`, `first`, and `_` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two inputs. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The current value of `i` is still in the keys of `mpp` and its frequency is still 1. The value of `i` which is 0 is no longer being printed because we have broken out of the loop or if statement.
