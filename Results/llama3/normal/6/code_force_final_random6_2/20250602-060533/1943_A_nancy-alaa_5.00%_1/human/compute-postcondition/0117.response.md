Output State: **`_` is the number of test cases, `n` is an integer, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective frequencies, `first` is True if `mpp[i]` is 1 for any `i` in the range of `n`, otherwise `first` remains False, stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: the loop has processed all the test cases, and the variables `n`, `i`, `arr`, `mpp`, and `first` have their final values after processing the last test case. The variable `_` has the total number of test cases, and the standard input `stdin` is empty because all test cases have been processed.
