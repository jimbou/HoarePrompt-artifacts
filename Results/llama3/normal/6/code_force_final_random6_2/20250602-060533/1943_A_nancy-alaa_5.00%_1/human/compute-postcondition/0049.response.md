Output: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective frequencies, `first` is True, `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs. The current value of `i` is in the keys of `mpp` and the frequency of `i` in `mpp` is 1. The program has not broken out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the value of `i` which is 0 is being printed**
