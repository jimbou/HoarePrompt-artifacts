According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is `n`, so for the loop to execute, `i` must be 0 and `n` must be greater than 0.
State: **`n` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, arr is a list of integers, mpp is a dictionary where keys are elements from arr and values are their respective frequencies, first is False, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs.**
