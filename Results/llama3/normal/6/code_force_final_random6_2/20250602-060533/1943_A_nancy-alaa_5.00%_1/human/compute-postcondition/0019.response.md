Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective frequencies, `first` is True if the frequency of `i` in `arr` is 1, otherwise `first` is False, `_` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the value of `i` which is 1 has been printed.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `i`, `arr`, `mpp`, `first`, and `_` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the value of `i` which is 1 has been printed. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.
