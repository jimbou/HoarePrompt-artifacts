Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective frequencies, `first` is True, `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs. The current value of `mpp[i]` is 1. If `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.**

In this output state, the value of `first` has been updated to True. The other variables remain unchanged. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`, otherwise, no action is taken.
