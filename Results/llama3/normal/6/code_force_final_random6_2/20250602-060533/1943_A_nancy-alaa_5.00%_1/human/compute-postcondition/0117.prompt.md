Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (the number of elements in the list) and then a list of integers (the elements of the list). The integers in the list are non-negative and less than the number of elements in the list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mpp = Counter(arr)
    first = False
    for i in range(n):
        if i not in mpp.keys():
            print(i)
            break
        if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
            print(i)
            break
        if mpp[i] == 1:
            first = True


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is 0, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective frequencies, `first` is True if the frequency of `i` in `arr` is 1, otherwise `first` is False, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer, i is n, arr is a list of integers, mpp is a dictionary where keys are elements from arr and values are their respective frequencies, first is True if mpp[i] is 1 for any i in range(n), otherwise first remains False, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective frequencies, `first` is True if `mpp[i]` is 1 for any `i` in the range of `n`, otherwise `first` remains False, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
