Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective frequencies, `first` is True if `mpp[i]` is 1, otherwise `first` remains False, `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the value of `i` which is 1 is being printed.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `n`, `arr`, `mpp`, `first`, and `_` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still 1, and it is being printed. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two inputs. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
