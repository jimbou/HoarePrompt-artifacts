Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective frequencies, `first` is True if the frequency of `i` in `arr` is 1, otherwise `first` is False, `_` is 0. If the frequency of `i` in `arr` is 1 and `first` is True, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the value of `i` which is 1 has been printed. Otherwise, no change occurs.**
