Output State: **n is an integer, i is n, arr is a list of integers, mpp is a dictionary where keys are elements from arr and values are their respective frequencies, first is False, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs.**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. The second line assigns a list of integers from stdin to `arr`. The third line creates a dictionary `mpp` where keys are elements from `arr` and values are their respective frequencies. The fourth line sets `first` to `False`. No other variables are affected.
