Based on the initial state, the code will print the value of `i`, which is 1.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

* `i` is initialized to 1.
* The code checks if `i` is in the keys of the dictionary `mpp`. Since `i` is 1, it checks if 1 is a key in `mpp`.
* If 1 is not a key in `mpp`, the code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. However, since we are only given a single print statement, we can assume that the loop or if statement is not relevant to this specific print statement.
* Since `i` is 1 and has been printed, the print statement will output the value of `i`, which is 1.

Output: **1**
