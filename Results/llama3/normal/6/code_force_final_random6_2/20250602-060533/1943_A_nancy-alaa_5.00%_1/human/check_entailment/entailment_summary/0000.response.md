Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer (n) followed by a list of n integers.
2.  It uses a Counter object from the collections module to count the occurrences of each integer in the list.
3.  The program then iterates over the range [0, n) and checks if each integer is present in the Counter object. If an integer is not present, it prints that integer and breaks the loop. This is because the MEX of the array is the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array.
4.  If an integer is present in the Counter object but its count is 1, the program checks if it's the second occurrence of such an integer (i.e., `first` is True). If it is, the program prints that integer and breaks the loop. This is because Alice wants to maximize the score, and if she picks an integer that appears only once, Bob can't pick it, and the MEX of the array will be that integer.
5.  If an integer is present in the Counter object but its count is greater than 1, the program continues to the next integer.
6.  The program processes all test cases and leaves the standard input empty.

Correctness: **True**
