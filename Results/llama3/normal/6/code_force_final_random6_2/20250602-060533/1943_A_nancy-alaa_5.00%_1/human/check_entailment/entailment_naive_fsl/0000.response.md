Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the strategy for Alice to maximize the score and Bob to minimize it. The program uses a Counter to count the occurrences of each number in the array, and then iterates through the numbers from 0 to n. If a number is not present in the array, it prints that number as the score, because Alice can choose that number and Bob cannot. If a number is present in the array but its count is 1, and it's not the first occurrence of a number with count 1, it prints that number as the score, because Alice can choose that number and Bob cannot. If a number is present in the array but its count is greater than 1, or if it's the first occurrence of a number with count 1, it continues to the next number.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including when the array contains only one number, when the array contains multiple numbers with count 1, and when the array contains numbers with count greater than 1. It also correctly handles the case when the array is empty, because the loop will not execute and the program will not print anything.

Therefore, the program is correct and will produce the correct output for all possible inputs.
