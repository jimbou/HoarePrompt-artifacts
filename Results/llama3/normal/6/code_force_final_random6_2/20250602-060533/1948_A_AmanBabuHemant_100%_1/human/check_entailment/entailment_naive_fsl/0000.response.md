Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct because it meets all the requirements specified in the problem description. It correctly handles all possible cases, including when the input number `n` is odd (in which case it prints "NO") and when `n` is even (in which case it constructs a string with exactly `n` special characters and prints "YES" followed by the constructed string).

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the required behavior. The use of the `if n % 2:` condition to check if `n` is odd or even is a good approach, and the construction of the string `s` using the `'AAB' * (n // 2)` expression is efficient and effective.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the program. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
