Reasoning:

1. The problem statement requires building a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly n special characters, where a special character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
2. The given program defines a function `func()` that takes no arguments and reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
3. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and checks if it is odd. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible to build a string with an odd number of special characters.
4. If `n` is even, it constructs a string `s` by repeating the pattern 'AAB' `n // 2` times. This pattern has 2 special characters ('A' and 'B'), so repeating it `n // 2` times will result in a string with exactly `n` special characters.
5. The program then checks if the length of the constructed string `s` is less than 200. If it is, it prints 'YES' followed by the string `s`. If the length of `s` is 200 or more, it prints 'NO'.
6. The program does not handle the case where `n` is 0, but since the problem statement specifies that `n` is between 1 and 50, this is not a concern.

Correctness: **True**
