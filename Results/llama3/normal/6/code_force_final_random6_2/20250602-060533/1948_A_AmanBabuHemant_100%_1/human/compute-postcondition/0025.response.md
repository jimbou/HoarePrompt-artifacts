Based on the initial state, the print statement will print the string `s`, which consists of 'AAB' repeated `n//2` times.

Since `n` is an integer, `n//2` will be the integer division of `n` by 2, which means it will be the largest whole number less than or equal to `n/2`.

For example, if `n` is 4, `n//2` will be 2, and `s` will be 'AAB' repeated 2 times, resulting in 'AABAAB'.

If `n` is 5, `n//2` will be 2, and `s` will be 'AAB' repeated 2 times, resulting in 'AABAAB'.

So, the print statement will print the string `s`, which consists of 'AAB' repeated `n//2` times.

Output: **'AAB' repeated n//2 times**
