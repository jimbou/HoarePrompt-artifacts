Reasoning:

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it checks if the input integer `n` is even or odd. If `n` is odd, it correctly prints 'NO' because it's impossible to construct a string with an odd number of special characters.
3. If `n` is even, it generates a string `s` by repeating 'AAB' `n//2` times. This is a correct approach because each repetition of 'AAB' contributes 2 special characters (at positions 1 and 3), and `n//2` repetitions will result in exactly `n` special characters.
4. The program checks if the length of the generated string `s` is less than 200. This is a valid check because the problem statement guarantees that if a solution exists, it can be represented as a string of length at most 200.
5. If the length of `s` is less than 200, the program correctly prints 'YES' followed by the string `s`. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, and the example output matches the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
