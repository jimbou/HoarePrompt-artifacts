Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string consisting of 'AAB' repeated n//2 times, and stdin contains one input: an integer. If the length of `s` is less than 200, 'YES' is printed and the string `s` is printed, where `s` is 'AAB' repeated n//2 times. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
