Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, and stdin is empty. If `n` is odd, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is even, a string `s` consisting of `n`/2 repetitions of the substring 'AAB' is created. If the length of `s` is less than 200, 'YES' is printed and the string `s` is printed. If the length of `s` is 200 or more, 'NO' is printed.***
