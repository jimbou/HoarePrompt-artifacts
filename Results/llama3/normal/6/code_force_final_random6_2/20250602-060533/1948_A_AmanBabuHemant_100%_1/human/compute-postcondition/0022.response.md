Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string consisting of 'AAB' repeated n//2 times, and stdin contains one input: an integer.**

In this output state, the value of `s` is calculated by repeating the string 'AAB' n//2 times, where n is an integer. The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains one input: an integer.
