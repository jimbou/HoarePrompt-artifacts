To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The objects involved are `_` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 1 and `t` is at least 2.

To execute the loop again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, so `_` becomes 2. The value of `t` remains the same, but since `_` is now 2, `t` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables `n`, `s`, and the contents of `stdin` are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, and stdin contains one input: an integer.**
