Based on the precondition, we can determine the output of the print statement as follows:

* `s` is a string of 'AAB' repeated `n//2` times. Since `n` is an integer, `n//2` will be an integer as well (because `//` is integer division in Python).
* The string `s` will consist of `n//2` repetitions of the substring 'AAB'. For example, if `n` is 6, `s` would be 'AABAAB'.
* The `print(s)` statement will output the entire string `s`.

Output: **'AAB' repeated n//2 times (where n is the value of n)**
