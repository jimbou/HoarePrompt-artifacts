This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n. For each test case, it checks if n is even. If n is odd, it prints 'NO'. If n is even, it generates a string s by repeating 'AAB' n//2 times and checks if the length of s is less than 200. If the length of s is less than 200, it prints 'YES' followed by the string s. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function continues this process until all test cases have been processed, at which point standard input is empty.
