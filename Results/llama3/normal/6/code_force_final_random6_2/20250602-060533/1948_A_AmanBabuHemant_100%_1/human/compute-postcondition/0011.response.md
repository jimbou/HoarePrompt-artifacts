The code prints the string `s`, which consists of `n`/2 repetitions of the substring 'AAB'. Since `n` is an even integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `n`/2 is an integer between 0.5 and 25 inclusive. Therefore, the string `s` will contain between 0.5 and 25 repetitions of 'AAB'.

Output: **A string consisting of between 0.5 and 25 repetitions of 'AAB'**
