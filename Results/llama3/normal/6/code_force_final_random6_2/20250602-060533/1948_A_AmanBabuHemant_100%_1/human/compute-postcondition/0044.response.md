Output State: **`t` is 0, `_` is `t`, `n` is an integer, and stdin is empty. If `n` is odd, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is even, a string `s` is created by repeating 'AAB' n//2 times. If the length of `s` is less than 200, 'YES' is printed and the string `s` is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**

This output state indicates that the loop has finished executing all its iterations. The variable `t` has been decremented to 0, indicating that the loop has completed its specified number of iterations. The variable `_` has been incremented to the initial value of `t`, indicating that the loop has executed `t` times. The variable `n` still holds the last input integer value, and stdin is empty, indicating that all input values have been processed. The output state also describes the final output based on the last input value `n`, which is either 'NO' if `n` is odd, or 'YES' and the string `s` if `n` is even and the length of `s` is less than 200.
