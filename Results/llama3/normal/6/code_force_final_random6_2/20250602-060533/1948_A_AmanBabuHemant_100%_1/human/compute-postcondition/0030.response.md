Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, and stdin contains one input: an integer. If `n` is odd, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is even, a string `s` is created by repeating 'AAB' n//2 times. If the length of `s` is less than 200, 'YES' is printed and the string `s` is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
