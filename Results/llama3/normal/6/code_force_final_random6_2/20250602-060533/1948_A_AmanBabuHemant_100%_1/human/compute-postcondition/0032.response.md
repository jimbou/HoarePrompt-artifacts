The code `n = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `n`. Since stdin contains one input: an integer, this input is consumed and assigned to `n`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer from the input**
