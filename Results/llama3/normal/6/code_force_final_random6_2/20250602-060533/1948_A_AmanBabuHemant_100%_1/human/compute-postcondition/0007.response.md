Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an even integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `s` is a string consisting of `n`/2 repetitions of the substring 'AAB', and stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `s` is calculated by repeating the substring 'AAB' `n`/2 times, where `n` is an even integer between 1 and 50 inclusive. The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged, and stdin remains empty.
