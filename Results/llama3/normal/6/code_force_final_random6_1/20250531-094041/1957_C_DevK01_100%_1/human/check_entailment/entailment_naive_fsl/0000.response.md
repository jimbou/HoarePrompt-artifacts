Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly calculates the number of different final configurations possible when continuing the game after k moves.

The program first reads the input, which includes the size of the chessboard (n) and the number of moves already played (k). It then reads the k moves, which are the positions (r, c) where the white rook was placed.

The program then calculates the number of remaining valid moves by subtracting 2 from n for each move where the white rook was placed at a position (r, c) where r != c, and subtracting 1 from n for each move where the white rook was placed at a position (r, c) where r == c.

The program then calls the function func_1(n) to calculate the number of different final configurations possible with the remaining valid moves. The function func_1(n) uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of configurations.

The dynamic programming approach is correct because it takes into account the fact that the computer will mirror the player's moves, and that the player can only place a white rook at a position (r, c) if the computer has not already placed a black rook at the same position.

The program correctly handles the case where the player places a white rook at a position (r, c) where r == c, in which case the computer skips its turn.

The program also correctly handles the case where the player has already played k moves, and the computer has mirrored those moves.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
