Output State: **dp is [3, (dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)], i is 3, n is a positive integer greater than 3**

Explanation:
The first line of the code adds a new element to the end of the list `dp`. This new element is calculated as `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)`. Since `dp` is initially `[1, 3]` and `i` is 3, the new element is `(3 + 2 * (3 - 1) * 1) % (7 + 10 ** 9)`, which simplifies to `(3 + 4) % (7 + 10 ** 9)`, and further to `7 % (7 + 10 ** 9)`, resulting in `7`. Therefore, `dp` becomes `[1, 3, 7]`.

The second line of the code removes the first element from the list `dp` using the `pop(0)` method. This operation modifies the list `dp` to `[3, 7]`.

The variable `i` remains unchanged throughout the code execution, so its value remains 3.

The variable `n` is not modified by the code and remains a positive integer greater than 3.

Therefore, the final output state is: `dp` is `[3, 7]`, `i` is 3, and `n` is a positive integer greater than 3.
