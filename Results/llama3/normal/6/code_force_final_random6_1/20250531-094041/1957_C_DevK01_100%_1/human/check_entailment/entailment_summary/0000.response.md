Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the number of different final configurations possible when continuing the game after k moves. The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the nth element of a sequence, where each element is the result of a modular calculation involving the previous two elements. This approach ensures that the program can handle large inputs efficiently.

The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard (n) and the number of moves already played (k). It then reads the coordinates of the k moves and updates the size of the chessboard accordingly. After that, it calls the function func_1 to calculate the number of different final configurations possible and prints the result.

The function func_1 uses dynamic programming to calculate the nth element of the sequence. It initializes a list dp with the first two elements of the sequence, then iteratively calculates the next elements using the modular calculation. The function returns the last element of the list, which is the nth element of the sequence.

The program correctly handles the case where the computer cannot mirror the player's move (i.e., when the coordinates of the move are the same). In this case, the program decrements the size of the chessboard by 1 instead of 2.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
