Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The problem statement requires us to find the number of different final configurations possible when we continue the game after k moves. The program correctly calculates this by considering the remaining valid moves on the chessboard.

2. The program correctly handles the case where the computer cannot mirror the player's move (i.e., when r = c). In this case, it simply decrements n by 1, which is correct because the computer's move does not affect the number of valid moves.

3. The function func_1 calculates the number of possible final configurations using dynamic programming. The recurrence relation used in the function is correct: for each i, the number of possible configurations is the sum of the number of configurations for i-1 and 2*(i-1) times the number of configurations for i-2. This is because for each of the i-1 rows, we can place a rook in two different columns, and for each of the i-2 rows, we can place a rook in two different columns and then place another rook in the remaining column.

4. The program correctly handles the modulo operation to prevent overflow.

5. The program correctly returns the last element of the list 'dp', which is the result of the calculation (dp[-1] + 2 * (n - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10**9).

Correctness: **True**
