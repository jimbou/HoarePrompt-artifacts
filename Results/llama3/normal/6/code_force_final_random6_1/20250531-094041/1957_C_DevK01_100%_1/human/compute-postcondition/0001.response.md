According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer and `dp` is a list containing two elements, both equal to 1. So for the loop to be executed `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 and `i` is now 2.
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `dp` is a list containing two elements, both equal to 1, `i` is 2**
