Output State: **dp is [ (dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9), (dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9) ]**

The code adds a new element to the end of the list `dp`, which is the result of the expression `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)`. This expression uses the last two elements of the list `dp` and the value of `i`, which is not defined in the initial state. Since `i` is not defined, we cannot calculate the exact value of the new element.

The second line of the code removes the first element of the list `dp` using the `pop(0)` method. This means that the original first element of the list, which was `3`, is removed.

Therefore, the final state of `dp` is a list with two elements: the new element added in the first line, and the original second element, which is `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)`. The exact values of these elements cannot be determined without knowing the value of `i`.
