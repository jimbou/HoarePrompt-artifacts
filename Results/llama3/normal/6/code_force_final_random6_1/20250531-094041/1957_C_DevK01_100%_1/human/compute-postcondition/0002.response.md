The code snippet provided modifies the `dp` list and the `i` variable. The first line appends a new element to the `dp` list, which is calculated using the last two elements of the list and the value of `i`. The second line removes the first element from the `dp` list.

Since `dp` initially contains two elements, both equal to 1, and `i` is 2, the new element appended to `dp` is calculated as follows:

`dp[-1]` is the last element of the list, which is 1.
`dp[-2]` is the second last element of the list, which is also 1.
`i - 1` is 2 - 1 = 1.
`2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]` is 2 * 1 * 1 = 2.
`dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]` is 1 + 2 = 3.
`3 % (7 + 10 ** 9)` is 3 (since 3 is less than 7 + 10^9).

So, the new element appended to `dp` is 3.

After the first line, `dp` becomes [1, 1, 3].

The second line removes the first element from `dp`, which is 1. So, `dp` becomes [1, 3].

The value of `i` is not modified by the code.

Output State: **dp is [1, 3], i is 2, n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2**
