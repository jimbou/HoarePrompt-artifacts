#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
    dp = [1, 1]
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        dp += [(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)]
        
        dp.pop(0)
        
    #State: dp is [dp[-1] + 2 * (n - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10
    return dp[-1]
    #The program returns the last element of the list 'dp', which is the result of the calculation (dp[-1] + 2 * (n - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10

#Overall this is what the function does:Calculates the nth element of a sequence using dynamic programming, where each element is the result of a modular calculation involving the previous two elements, and returns the calculated value.
