Output State: **dp is [dp[-1] + 2 * (n - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9), dp[-1] + 2 * (n - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)], i is n + 1, n is a positive integer.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a list `dp` containing two elements, both of which are the result of the expression `(dp[-1] + 2 * (n - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)`, and the value of `i` is `n + 1`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as a positive integer.
