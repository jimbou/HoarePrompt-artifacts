The code prints the difference between k and q. Where k is the absolute difference between n and m, and q is 2 to the power of p-1, and p is the number of digits in the binary representation of k.
Output: **k - q (where k is the absolute difference between n and m, and q is 2 to the power of p-1, and p is the number of digits in the binary representation of k)**
