The only variables in the loop head are variable  i and the input from stdin, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input from stdin. If the input from stdin has at least one more line, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line, i is 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time the stdin must have at least one more line and i is 1.
State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, k is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute difference between n and m, i is 1, stdin contains multiple lines of input.**
