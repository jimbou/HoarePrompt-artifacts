Postcondition: **n is an integer, m is an integer, k is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute difference between n and m, i is 1, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line that was read by the code. If the absolute difference between n and m is a power of 2, then the absolute difference between n and m is printed. Otherwise, if n is 0 and m is odd, the number 1 is printed. If n is 0 and m is even, the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, the difference between the absolute difference between n and m and 2 to the power of p-1 is printed, where p is the number of digits in the binary representation of the absolute difference between n and m.**
