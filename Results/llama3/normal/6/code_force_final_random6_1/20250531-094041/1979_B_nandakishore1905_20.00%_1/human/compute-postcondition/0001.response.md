The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the values of `n` and `m` from the input, which is a line of input from stdin containing two space-separated integers. Since `input()` is greater than 0, we know that there is at least one line of input available. After this line executes, stdin will have one less line of input.

The second line calculates the absolute difference between `n` and `m` and assigns it to `k`. This line does not affect the state of stdin or the value of `i`.

Combining the effects of both lines, we can conclude that the final state of the program is:

Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, k is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute difference between n and m, i is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line**
