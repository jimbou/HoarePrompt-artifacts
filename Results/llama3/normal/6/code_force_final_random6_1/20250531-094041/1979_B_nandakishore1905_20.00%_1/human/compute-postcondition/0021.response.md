Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, k is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute difference between n and m, i is 1, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line that was read by the code**

The code first reads a line from stdin, which contains two integers separated by a space. These integers are assigned to `n` and `m`, respectively. The second line calculates the absolute difference between `n` and `m` and assigns it to `k`. Since `k` is defined as the absolute difference between `n` and `m` in the initial state, this line ensures that `k` remains consistent with this definition. The value of `i` is not affected by the code and remains 1. Stdin now contains one less line of input because one line was read by the code.
