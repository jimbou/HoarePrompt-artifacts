Postcondition: ***n is an integer, m is an integer, k is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute difference between n and m, i is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line. If k is a power of 2, k is printed. If k is not a power of 2, then if n is 0 and m is odd, the number 1 is printed. If n is 0 and m is even, the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, the value of k minus 2 raised to the power of p-1 is printed, where p is the number of digits in the binary representation of k.***
