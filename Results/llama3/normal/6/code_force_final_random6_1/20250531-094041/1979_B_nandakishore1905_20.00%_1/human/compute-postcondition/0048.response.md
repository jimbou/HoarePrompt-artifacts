Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, k is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute difference between n and m, i is equal to the number of test cases t, stdin is empty. If the absolute difference between n and m (k) is a power of 2, then k is printed. Otherwise, if n is 0 and m is odd, the number 1 is printed. If n is 0 and m is even, the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, the value of k minus 2 to the power of p-1 is printed, where p is the number of digits in the binary representation of k.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed for all test cases, and the input from stdin has been fully consumed. The loop counter `i` has reached the value of `t`, which is the number of test cases. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` still represent the parameters of the sequences and the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, respectively. The output of the loop is determined by the same conditions as before, depending on whether `k` is a power of 2, `n` is 0 and `m` is odd or even, or `k` is not a power of 2.
