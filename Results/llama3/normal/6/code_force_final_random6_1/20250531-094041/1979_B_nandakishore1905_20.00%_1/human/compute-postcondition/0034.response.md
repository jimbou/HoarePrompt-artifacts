To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for i in range(int(input())):`. The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the input from `stdin`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `stdin` contains multiple lines of input minus one line that was read by the code.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than the number of lines in `stdin`. Since `i` is 1, it must be incremented by 1 to 2. Additionally, `stdin` must have at least one more line for the loop to execute again.

The other variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `i` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple lines of input minus two lines that were read by the code.**
