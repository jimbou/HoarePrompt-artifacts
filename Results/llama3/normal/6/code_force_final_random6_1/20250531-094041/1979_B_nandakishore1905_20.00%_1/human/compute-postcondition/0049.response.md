Functionality: **This function reads multiple lines of input from stdin, where the first line contains the number of test cases, and each subsequent line contains two integers. It calculates the absolute difference between the two integers and prints a value based on the following rules: if the difference is a power of 2, it prints the difference; if the first integer is 0 and the second is odd, it prints 1; if the first integer is 0 and the second is even, it prints 2; otherwise, it prints the difference minus 2 to the power of the number of digits in the binary representation of the difference minus 1. The function processes all test cases and leaves stdin empty.**
