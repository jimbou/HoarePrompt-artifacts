Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) — the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains two integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 10^9, x != y) — the parameters of the sequences.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    k = abs(n - m)
    if k & k - 1 == 0:
        print(k)
    elif n == 0 and m % 2 != 0:
        print(1)
    elif n == 0 and m % 2 == 0:
        print(2)
    else:
        l = bin(k).replace('0b', '')
        p = len(l)
        q = 2 ** (p - 1)
        print(k - q)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer, m is an integer, k is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute difference between n and m, i is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line. If k is a power of 2, k is printed. If k is not a power of 2, then if n is 0 and m is odd, the number 1 is printed. If n is 0 and m is even, the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, the value of k minus 2 raised to the power of p-1 is printed, where p is the number of digits in the binary representation of k.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer, m is an integer, k is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute difference between n and m, i is 1, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line that was read by the code. If the absolute difference between n and m is a power of 2, then the absolute difference between n and m is printed. Otherwise, if n is 0 and m is odd, the number 1 is printed. If n is 0 and m is even, the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, the difference between the absolute difference between n and m and 2 to the power of p-1 is printed, where p is the number of digits in the binary representation of the absolute difference between n and m.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer, m is an integer, k is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute difference between n and m, i is 2, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus two lines that were read by the code. If the absolute difference between n and m (k) is a power of 2, then k is printed. Otherwise, if n is 0 and m is odd, the number 1 is printed. If n is 0 and m is even, the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, the value of k minus 2 to the power of p-1 is printed, where p is the number of digits in the binary representation of k.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
