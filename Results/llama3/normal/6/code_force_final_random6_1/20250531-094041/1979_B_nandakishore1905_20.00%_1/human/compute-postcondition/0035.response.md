Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, k is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute difference between n and m, i is 2, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus two lines that were read by the code.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to `n` and `m`, respectively. This means that `n` and `m` now hold the values of the two integers read from stdin. The second line calculates the absolute difference between `n` and `m` and assigns it to `k`. Since `k` is defined as the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, its value is updated to reflect the new values of `n` and `m`.

The variable `i` is not affected by the code snippet, so its value remains 2. The state of stdin is also updated, as two lines of input have been read by the code.

In summary, the code snippet updates the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, and reduces the number of lines in stdin by two. The final state of the variables and stdin is as described above.
