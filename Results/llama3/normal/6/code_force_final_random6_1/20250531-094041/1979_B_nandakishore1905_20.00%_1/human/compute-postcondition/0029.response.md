The code prints the difference between the absolute difference between the integers n and m, and 2 to the power of the number of digits in the binary representation of the absolute difference between n and m minus 1.
Output: **k - 2^(p-1) (where k is the absolute difference between n and m, and p is the number of digits in the binary representation of k)**
