The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) does ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is at least 1 and `i` is now 0. 
State: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0**
