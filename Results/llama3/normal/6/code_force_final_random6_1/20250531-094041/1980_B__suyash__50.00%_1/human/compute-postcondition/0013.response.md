Postcondition: ***t is at least 1, i is 0, a is a string, b is a list of 3 integers, o is a sorted list of strings in descending order, n is an integer, f is an integer, k is an integer, fav is a string equal to the f-1th element of the original list o, dic is a dictionary where each key is a string from the original list o and each value is the count of that string in the original list o. If the current value of fav's index in list o is greater than k - 1, the program skips to the next iteration of the loop.***
