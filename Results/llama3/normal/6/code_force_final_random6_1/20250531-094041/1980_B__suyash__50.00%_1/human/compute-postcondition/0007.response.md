Postcondition: ***t is at least 1, i is 0, a is a string, b is a list of 3 integers, o is a list of strings, n is an integer, f is an integer, k is an integer, if k is equal to n, 'YES' is printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
