Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a string, `b` is a list of 3 integers, `o` is a sorted list of strings in descending order, `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `dic` is a dictionary where each key is a string from the original list `o` and each value is the count of that string in the original list `o`, `l` is a sorted list of unique strings from `o` in descending order that must have at least 2 elements, `k` is decreased by the count of the string at index `i` in list `l` in the original list `o`. If `k` is less than 0, or otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
