Postcondition: ***t is greater than the length of l plus 2, i is equal to the length of l plus 1, a is a string of space-separated integers, b is a list of 3 integers, o is a list of strings, n is an integer equal to the first integer in b, f is an integer equal to the second integer in b, dic is a dictionary where each key is a string from the original list o and each value is the count of that string in the original list o, l is a sorted list of unique strings from o in descending order, k is an integer equal to the third integer in b, fav is a string equal to the f-1th element of o. If k is equal to n, then we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
