Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether Dmitry's favorite cube will be removed in all cases, not removed in any case, or may be either removed or left. 

The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of cubes, the index of the favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes. It then reads the values shown on the cubes. 

The program sorts the values in descending order and counts the occurrences of each value. It then checks if the favorite cube's value is among the top k values. If it is, the program checks if there are any values greater than the favorite cube's value that would push it out of the top k. If there are, the program prints "MAYBE". If not, it prints "YES". 

If the favorite cube's value is not among the top k values, the program prints "NO". 

The program correctly handles the edge case where k is equal to n, in which case it prints "YES" because all cubes are removed. 

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem and handles all possible cases.

Correctness: **True**
