Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a list of 3 integers, `o` is a sorted list of strings in descending order, `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `dic` is a dictionary where each key is a string from the original list `o` and each value is the count of that string in the original list `o`, `l` is a sorted list of unique strings from `o` in descending order that must have at least 1 element. If `fav` is not equal to the ith element of `l`, then `k` is decreased by the count of the ith element of `l` in the original list `o`. If `k` is less than or equal to 0, 'NO' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made. If `fav` is equal to the ith element of `l`, then `k` is decreased by the count of the string `fav` in the original list `o` and `fav` is set to the ith element of the list `l`. If `k` is less than 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k` is larger or equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and 'YES' is being printed.***
