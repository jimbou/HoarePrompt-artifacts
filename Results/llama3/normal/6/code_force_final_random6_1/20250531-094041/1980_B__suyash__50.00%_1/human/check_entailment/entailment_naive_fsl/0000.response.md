Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when the input is:

5 2 2
4 3 3 2 3

The program outputs "MAYBE", but the correct output should be "YES" because the favorite cube (3) will always be removed in this case.

The issue with the program is that it does not correctly handle the case when the favorite cube has the same value as other cubes. In this case, the program should check if the favorite cube is among the first k cubes with the same value, but it does not do so. Instead, it only checks if the favorite cube is among the first k cubes with a higher value, which is not sufficient.

To fix this issue, the program should be modified to correctly handle the case when the favorite cube has the same value as other cubes. One possible solution is to use a more sophisticated data structure, such as a dictionary, to keep track of the count of each value and then use this information to determine if the favorite cube will be removed.
