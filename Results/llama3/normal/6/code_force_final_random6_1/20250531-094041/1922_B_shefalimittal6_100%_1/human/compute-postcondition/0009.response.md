Output State: **t is an integer equal to the first integer from the first test case and must be greater than 0, idx is n + 2, results is an empty list, data contains the remaining test cases, _ is n - 1, n is an integer equal to the second integer from the first test case and must be greater than 0, v is a list of zeros with a length equal to n + 1, except for the element at index x which is equal to n, where x is the integer value from the data at index 2.**

This output state describes the final state of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations. The variable `t` remains unchanged, `idx` has been incremented by `n`, `results` is still an empty list, `data` contains the remaining test cases, `_` has been incremented by `n-1`, `n` is still the same, and `v` is a list of zeros with a length of `n+1`, except for the element at index `x` which has been incremented by `n`, where `x` is the integer value from the data at index 2.
