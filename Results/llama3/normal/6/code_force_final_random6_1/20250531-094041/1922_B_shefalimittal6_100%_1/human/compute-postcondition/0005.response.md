The only variable in the loop head is variable `_`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **t is an integer equal to the first integer from the first test case and must be greater than 0, idx is 3, results is an empty list, data contains the remaining test cases, _ is 1, n is an integer equal to the second integer from the first test case and must be greater than 1, v is a list of zeros with a length equal to n + 1, except for the element at index x which is equal to 1, where x is the integer value from the data at index 2.**
