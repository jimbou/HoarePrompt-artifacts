To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects within it.

The loop head is `for _ in range(n):`. The only objects in the loop head are `_` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer equal to the second integer from the first test case and must be greater than 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be decremented by 1, since the loop iterates `n` times. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 0.

The state of `_` is not relevant to the loop execution, so we don't need to adjust it.

The other variables in the state (`t`, `idx`, `results`, `data`, `v`, `i`, `cnt`, `ans`, and `x`) are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer equal to the first integer from the second test case and must be greater than 0, `idx` is `n + 5`, `results` is a list containing the string representation of the sum of `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` for all `i` where `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, plus `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` for all `i` where `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, `data` contains the remaining test cases, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer equal to the second integer from the first test case and must be greater than 0, `v` is a list of zeros with a length equal to `n + 1`, where `v[x]` is 2, `i` is `n`, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is 0, and `x` is an integer equal to the value at index `idx - 1` in `data**
