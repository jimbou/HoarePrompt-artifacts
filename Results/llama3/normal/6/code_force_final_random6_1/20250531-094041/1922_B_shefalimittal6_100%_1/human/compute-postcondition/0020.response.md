Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to the first integer from the first test case and must be greater than 0, `idx` is `n` + 2, `results` is an empty list, `data` contains the remaining test cases, `_` is `n` - 1, `n` is an integer equal to the second integer from the first test case and must be greater than 0, `v` is a list of zeros with a length equal to `n` + 1, except for the element at index `x` which is equal to `n`, where `x` is the integer value from the `data` at index 2, `i` is 1, `cnt` is equal to the value of `v` at index `i`, and `ans` is `cnt` * `v[i]` * (`v[i]` - 1) // 2 + `cnt` * `v[i]` * (`v[i]` - 1) // 2 if the value of `v` at index `i` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `ans` is `cnt` * `v[i]` * (`v[i]` - 1) // 2 + `cnt` * `v[i]` * (`v[i]` - 1) // 2.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `ans` has been updated by adding the product of `cnt`, `v[i]`, and (`v[i]` - 1) divided by 2, twice. The value of `ans` is now dependent on the value of `v` at index `i`, which is either 0 or `n`. If `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is the sum of two products of `cnt`, `v[i]`, and (`v[i]` - 1) divided by 2. Otherwise, `ans` is the sum of two products of `cnt`, `v[i]`, and (`v[i]` - 1) divided by 2.
