Output State: **t is an integer equal to the first integer from the second test case and must be greater than n + 1, idx is n + n + 7, results is a list containing the string representation of the sum of cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2 for all i where v[i] is greater than or equal to 2, plus v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6 for all i where v[i] is greater than or equal to 3, and the string representation of ans, data contains the remaining test cases, _ is 2, n is an integer equal to the value at index idx - 3 in data and must be greater than 2, v is a list of zeros with a length equal to n + 1, except for v[x] which is 3, i is n, cnt is 0, ans is 0, and x is an integer equal to the value at index idx - 2 in data.**

The code modifies the value of `idx` by incrementing it by 1, and the value of `x` by assigning it the integer value at index `idx` in `data`. The value of `v[x]` is incremented by 1. No other variables are affected.
