Output State: **t is an integer equal to the first integer from the second test case and must be greater than 0, idx is n + 4, results is a list containing the string representation of the sum of cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2 for all i where v[i] is greater than or equal to 2, plus v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6 for all i where v[i] is greater than or equal to 3, data contains the remaining test cases, _ is 0, n is an integer equal to the second integer from the first test case and must be greater than 0, v is a list of zeros with a length equal to n + 1, where v[x] is 1, i is n, cnt is 0, and ans is 0**

The code block executes as follows: The first line assigns the integer value of the data at index idx to x. Since idx is n + 3, x becomes the integer value of the data at index n + 3. The second line increments idx by 1, making idx equal to n + 4. The third line increments the value of v at index x by 1, making v[x] equal to 1. No other variables are affected.
