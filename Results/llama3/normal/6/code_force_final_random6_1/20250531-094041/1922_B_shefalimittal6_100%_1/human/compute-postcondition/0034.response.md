Output State: **t is an integer equal to the first integer from the second test case and must be greater than 0, idx is n + 3, results is a list containing the string representation of the sum of cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2 for all i where v[i] is greater than or equal to 2, plus v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6 for all i where v[i] is greater than or equal to 3, data contains the remaining test cases, _ is n, n is an integer equal to the second integer from the first test case and must be greater than 0, v is a list of zeros with a length equal to n + 1, i is n, cnt is 0, and ans is 0.**

The code first assigns the integer value from the data at index idx to n. Since idx is n + 2, this means that n is now equal to the second integer from the first test case. The second line increments idx by 1, making it n + 3. The third line creates a new list v of zeros with a length equal to n + 1. This means that the previous values of v, cnt, and ans are no longer valid, and they are now reset to their initial values. The value of t remains unchanged, as it is not affected by the code. The value of results also remains unchanged, as it is not affected by the code. The value of data remains unchanged, as it is not affected by the code. The value of _ remains unchanged, as it is not affected by the code. The value of i remains unchanged, as it is not affected by the code.
