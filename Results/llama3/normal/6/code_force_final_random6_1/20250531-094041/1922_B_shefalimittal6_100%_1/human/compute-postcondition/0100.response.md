The code prints the results of multiple test cases, where each result is the sum of `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` for all `i` where `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, plus `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` for all `i` where `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3. The results are printed one per line.

Output: **`t` is 0, `idx` is the length of `data`, `results` is a list containing the string representation of the sum of `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` for all `i` where `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, plus `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` for all `i` where `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, for each test case, `data` is empty, `_` is the last value of `n`, `n` is the last value of `n`, `v` is a list of zeros with a length equal to the last value of `n` + 1, `i` is the last value of `n`, `cnt` is the sum of all elements in the last `v`, and `ans` is the sum of `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` for all `i` where `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, plus `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` for all `i` where `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, for the last test case, and the results of multiple test cases are printed, one per line.**
