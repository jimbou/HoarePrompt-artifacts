Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to the first integer from the first test case and must be greater than 0, `idx` is `n` + 2, `results` is an empty list, `data` contains the remaining test cases, `_` is `n` - 1, `n` is an integer equal to the second integer from the first test case and must be greater than 0, `v` is a list of zeros with a length equal to `n` + 1, except for the element at index `x` which is equal to `n`, where `x` is the integer value from the `data` at index 2, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is `cnt` * `v[i]` * (`v[i]` - 1) // 2, `i` is 0.**

The code calculates the value of `ans` by multiplying `cnt` (which is 0), `v[i]` (which is greater than or equal to 2), and (`v[i]` - 1) (which is greater than or equal to 1), and then dividing the result by 2. Since `cnt` is 0, the value of `ans` will also be 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
