Output State: **t is an integer equal to the first integer from the second test case and must be greater than n + 1, idx is n + n + 5, results is a list containing the string representation of the sum of cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2 for all i where v[i] is greater than or equal to 2, plus v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6 for all i where v[i] is greater than or equal to 3, and the string representation of ans, data contains the remaining test cases, _ is 0, n is an integer equal to the value at index idx - 2 in data and must be greater than 0, v is a list of zeros with a length equal to n + 1, except for v[x] which is 1, i is n, cnt is 0, ans is 0, and x is an integer equal to the value at index idx - 1 in data**

The code block modifies the values of `x`, `idx`, and `v[x]`. The first line assigns the value at index `idx` in `data` to `x`, which is an integer equal to the value at index `idx - 1` in `data`. The second line increments `idx` by 1. The third line increments the value of `v[x]` by 1, making it 1 since it was initially 0. The remaining variables are not affected by the code block.
