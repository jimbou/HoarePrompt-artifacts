The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the state does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `_` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer equal to the first integer from the second test case and must be greater than n + 1, `idx` is n + n + 4, `results` is a list containing the string representation of the sum of cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2 for all i where v[i] is greater than or equal to 2, plus v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6 for all i where v[i] is greater than or equal to 3, and the string representation of ans, `data` contains the remaining test cases, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer equal to the value at index idx - 1 in data and must be greater than 0, `v` is a list of zeros with a length equal to n + 1, `i` is n, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is 0, and `x` is an integer equal to the value at index idx - 2 in data**
