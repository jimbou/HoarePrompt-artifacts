Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer equal to the first integer from the first test case and must be greater than 0, `idx` is `n` + 2, `results` is an empty list, `data` contains the remaining test cases, `_` is `n` - 1, `n` is an integer equal to the second integer from the first test case and must be greater than 0, `v` is a list of zeros with a length equal to `n` + 1, except for the element at index `x` which is equal to `n`, where `x` is the integer value from the `data` at index 2, `i` is 0. If the value of `v` at index `i` is greater than or equal to 2, then `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is `cnt` * `v[i]` * (`v[i]` - 1) // 2. Otherwise, the values of `cnt` and `ans` remain unchanged.***
