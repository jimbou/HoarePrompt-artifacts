Output State: **t is an integer equal to the first integer from the first test case and must be greater than 0, idx is 2, results is an empty list, data contains the remaining test cases, _ is 0, n is an integer equal to the second integer from the first test case, v is a list of zeros with a length equal to n + 1**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `idx` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 2. The `results` list remains empty as no elements are added to it. The `data` variable still contains the remaining test cases, but the first test case has been processed. The value of `_` remains 0 as it is not modified by the code.

The new variable `n` is assigned the value of the second integer from the first test case, which is an integer. The new variable `v` is a list of zeros with a length equal to `n + 1`, where `n` is the value assigned in the previous line.
