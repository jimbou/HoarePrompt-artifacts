The only variables in the loop head are variable _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer equal to the first integer from the first test case and must be greater than 0, `idx` is 2, `results` is an empty list, `data` contains the remaining test cases, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer equal to the second integer from the first test case, `v` is a list of zeros with a length equal to `n + 1`. So for the loop to be executed, `n` must be greater than 0 and `_` is 0.
State: **`t` is an integer equal to the first integer from the first test case and must be greater than 0, `idx` is 2, `results` is an empty list, `data` contains the remaining test cases, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer equal to the second integer from the first test case and must be greater than 0, `v` is a list of zeros with a length equal to `n + 1**
