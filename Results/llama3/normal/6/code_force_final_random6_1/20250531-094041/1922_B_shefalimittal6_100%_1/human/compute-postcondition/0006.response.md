Output State: **t is an integer equal to the first integer from the first test case and must be greater than 0, idx is 4, results is an empty list, data contains the remaining test cases, _ is 1, n is an integer equal to the second integer from the first test case and must be greater than 1, v is a list of zeros with a length equal to n + 1, except for the element at index x which is equal to 2, where x is the integer value from the data at index 2.**

The code executes as follows: The first line assigns the integer value from the data at index 3 to x. The second line increments idx by 1, making it 4. The third line increments the value of v at index x by 1, making it 2. No other variables are affected.
