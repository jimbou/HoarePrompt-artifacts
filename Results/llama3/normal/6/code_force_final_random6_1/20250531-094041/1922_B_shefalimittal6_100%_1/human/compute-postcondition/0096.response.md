Output State: **t is an integer equal to the first integer from the second test case and must be greater than n + 1, idx is n + n + n + 4, results is a list containing the string representation of the sum of cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2 for all i where v[i] is greater than or equal to 2, plus v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6 for all i where v[i] is greater than or equal to 3, and the string representation of ans, data contains the remaining test cases, _ is n, n is an integer equal to the value at index idx - n - 1 in data and must be greater than 0, v is a list of zeros with a length equal to n + 1, except for v[x] which is n, i is n, cnt is the sum of all elements in v, ans is the sum of cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2 for all i where v[i] is greater than or equal to 2, plus v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6 for all i where v[i] is greater than or equal to 3, and x is an integer equal to the value at index idx - n in data.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the variables in the loop head and body. The loop iterates over the list v, updating the variables cnt and ans based on the values of v[i]. After the loop finishes, the variable i is equal to n, cnt is the sum of all elements in v, and ans is the sum of cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2 for all i where v[i] is greater than or equal to 2, plus v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6 for all i where v[i] is greater than or equal to 3. The other variables in the precondition remain unchanged.
