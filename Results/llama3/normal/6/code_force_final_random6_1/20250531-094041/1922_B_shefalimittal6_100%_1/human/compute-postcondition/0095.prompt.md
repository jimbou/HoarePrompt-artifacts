Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer equal to the first integer from the second test case and must be greater than n + 1, idx is n + n + n + 4, results is a list containing the string representation of the sum of cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2 for all i where v[i] is greater than or equal to 2, plus v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6 for all i where v[i] is greater than or equal to 3, and the string representation of ans, data contains the remaining test cases, _ is n, n is an integer equal to the value at index idx - n - 1 in data and must be greater than 0, v is a list of zeros with a length equal to n + 1, except for v[x] which is n, i is n, cnt is 0, ans is 0, and x is an integer equal to the value at index idx - n in data.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n + 1):
    if v[i] >= 2:
        ans += cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2
    if v[i] >= 3:
        ans += v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6
    cnt += v[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer equal to the first integer from the second test case and must be greater than `n` + 1, `idx` is `n` + `n` + `n` + 4, `results` is a list containing the string representation of the sum of `cnt` * `v[i]` * (`v[i]` - 1) // 2 for all `i` where `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, plus `v[i]` * (`v[i]` - 1) * (`v[i]` - 2) // 6 for all `i` where `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, and the string representation of `ans`, `data` contains the remaining test cases, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer equal to the value at index `idx` - `n` - 1 in `data` and must be greater than 0, `v` is a list of zeros with a length equal to `n` + 1, except for `v[x]` which is `n`, `i` is 0, `cnt` is `v[0]`, `ans` is either `v[0]` * `v[0]` * (`v[0]` - 1) // 2 or `v[0]` * `v[0]` * (`v[0]` - 1) // 2 + `v[0]` * (`v[0]` - 1) * (`v[0]` - 2) // 6 depending on whether `v[0]` is less than 3 or not, and `x` is an integer equal to the value at index `idx` - `n` in `data`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer equal to the first integer from the second test case and must be greater than `n` + 1, `idx` is `n` + `n` + `n` + 4, `results` is a list containing the string representation of the sum of `cnt` * `v[i]` * (`v[i]` - 1) // 2 for all `i` where `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, plus `v[i]` * (`v[i]` - 1) * (`v[i]` - 2) // 6 for all `i` where `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, and the string representation of `ans`, `data` contains the remaining test cases, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer equal to the value at index `idx` - `n` - 1 in `data` and must be greater than 0, `v` is a list of zeros with a length equal to `n` + 1, except for `v[x]` which is `n`, `i` is 1, `cnt` is `v[0]` + `v[1]`, `ans` is either `v[0]` * `v[0]` * (`v[0]` - 1) // 2 + `cnt` * `v[i]` * (`v[i]` - 1) // 2 or `v[0]` * `v[0]` * (`v[0]` - 1) // 2 + `v[0]` * (`v[0]` - 1) * (`v[0]` - 2) // 6 + `cnt` * `v[i]` * (`v[i]` - 1) // 2 depending on whether `v[0]` is less than 3 or not, and `x` is an integer equal to the value at index `idx` - `n` in `data`. If `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is updated to include the sum of `cnt` * `v[i]` * (`v[i]` - 1) // 2 + `v[i]` * (`v[i]` - 1) * (`v[i]` - 2) // 6. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer equal to the first integer from the second test case and must be greater than `n` + 1, `idx` is `n` + `n` + `n` + 4, `results` is a list containing the string representation of the sum of `cnt` * `v[i]` * (`v[i]` - 1) // 2 for all `i` where `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, plus `v[i]` * (`v[i]` - 1) * (`v[i]` - 2) // 6 for all `i` where `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, and the string representation of `ans`, `data` contains the remaining test cases, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer equal to the value at index `idx` - `n` - 1 in `data` and must be greater than 1, `v` is a list of zeros with a length equal to `n` + 1, except for `v[x]` which is `n`, `i` is 2, `cnt` is `v[0]` + `v[1]` + `v[i]`, `ans` is either `v[0]` * `v[0]` * (`v[0]` - 1) // 2 + `cnt` * `v[i]` * (`v[i]` - 1) // 2 or `v[0]` * `v[0]` * (`v[0]` - 1) // 2 + `v[0]` * (`v[0]` - 1) * (`v[0]` - 2) // 6 + `cnt` * `v[i]` * (`v[i]` - 1) // 2 depending on whether `v[0]` is less than 3 or not, and `x` is an integer equal to the value at index `idx` - `n` in `data`. If `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is updated to include the sum of `cnt` * `v[i]` * (`v[i]` - 1) // 2 + `v[i]` * (`v[i]` - 1) * (`v[i]` - 2) // 6. Otherwise, `ans` remains the same.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
