Output State: **t is an integer equal to the first integer from the first test case and must be greater than 0, idx is 5, results is an empty list, data contains the remaining test cases, _ is 2, n is an integer equal to the second integer from the first test case and must be greater than 2, v is a list of zeros with a length equal to n + 1, except for the element at index x which is equal to 3, where x is the integer value from the data at index 2.**

In this output state, the value of `idx` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `v[x]` has been incremented by 1, where `x` is the integer value from the data at index 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
