The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is `n`, `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is `n + 1` and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than `n + 1`.
State: **`t` is an integer equal to the first integer from the second test case and must be greater than n + 1, `idx` is `n + n + 3`, `results` is a list containing the string representation of the sum of `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` for all `i` where `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, plus `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` for all `i` where `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, and the string representation of `ans`, `data` contains the remaining test cases, `_` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer equal to the second integer from the first test case and must be greater than 0, `v` is a list of zeros with a length equal to `n + 1`, where `v[x]` is equal to the number of times `x` appears in the test cases, `i` is `n`, `cnt` is the sum of `v[i]` for all `i`, `ans` is the sum of `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` for all `i` where `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, plus `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` for all `i` where `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, and `x` is an integer equal to the value at index `idx - 1` in `data`.**
