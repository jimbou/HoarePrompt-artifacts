This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It calculates the sum of combinations for each test case, specifically the sum of cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2 for all i where v[i] is greater than or equal to 2, plus v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6 for all i where v[i] is greater than or equal to 3. The results for each test case are stored in a list and then printed, separated by newline characters.
