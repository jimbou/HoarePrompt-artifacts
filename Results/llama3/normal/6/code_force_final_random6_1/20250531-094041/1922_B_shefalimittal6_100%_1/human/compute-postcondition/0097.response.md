Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to the first integer from the second test case and must be greater than `n` + 1, `idx` is `n` + `n` + `n` + 4, `results` is a list containing the string representation of the sum of `cnt` * `v[i]` * (`v[i]` - 1) // 2 for all `i` where `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, plus `v[i]` * (`v[i]` - 1) * (`v[i]` - 2) // 6 for all `i` where `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, and the string representation of `ans` twice, `data` contains the remaining test cases, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer equal to the value at index `idx` - `n` - 1 in `data` and must be greater than 0, `v` is a list of zeros with a length equal to `n` + 1, except for `v[x]` which is `n`, `i` is `n`, `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v`, `ans` is the sum of `cnt` * `v[i]` * (`v[i]` - 1) // 2 for all `i` where `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, plus `v[i]` * (`v[i]` - 1) * (`v[i]` - 2) // 6 for all `i` where `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, and `x` is an integer equal to the value at index `idx` - `n` in `data`.**

In natural language, the output state is that the list `results` now contains the string representation of `ans` twice, and all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is still the sum of `cnt` * `v[i]` * (`v[i]` - 1) // 2 for all `i` where `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, plus `v[i]` * (`v[i]` - 1) * (`v[i]` - 2) // 6 for all `i` where `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3.
