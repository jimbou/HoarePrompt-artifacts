Output State: **t is an integer equal to the first integer from the first test case and must be greater than 0, idx is n + 2, results is an empty list, data contains the remaining test cases, _ is n - 1, n is an integer equal to the second integer from the first test case and must be greater than 0, v is a list of zeros with a length equal to n + 1, except for the element at index x which is equal to n, where x is the integer value from the data at index 2, i is n, cnt is equal to the sum of all elements in v, and ans is the sum of cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2 for all i where v[i] is greater than or equal to 2, plus v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6 for all i where v[i] is greater than or equal to 3.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variables t, idx, results, data, _, and n remain unchanged. The list v remains the same, with all elements being zero except for the element at index x, which is equal to n. The variable i is now equal to n, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The variable cnt is now equal to the sum of all elements in v, and the variable ans is the sum of the products of cnt, v[i], and (v[i] - 1) divided by 2 for all i where v[i] is greater than or equal to 2, plus the products of v[i], (v[i] - 1), and (v[i] - 2) divided by 6 for all i where v[i] is greater than or equal to 3.
