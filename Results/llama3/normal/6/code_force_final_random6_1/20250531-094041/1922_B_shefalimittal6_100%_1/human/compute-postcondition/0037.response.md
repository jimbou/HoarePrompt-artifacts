The only variable in the loop head is variable _ and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than n, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 0, n is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again _ must be 1 and n must be greater than 1.
State: **t is an integer equal to the first integer from the second test case and must be greater than 0, idx is n + 4, results is a list containing the string representation of the sum of cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2 for all i where v[i] is greater than or equal to 2, plus v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6 for all i where v[i] is greater than or equal to 3, data contains the remaining test cases, _ is 1, n is an integer equal to the second integer from the first test case and must be greater than 1, v is a list of zeros with a length equal to n + 1, where v[x] is 1, i is n, cnt is 0, and ans is 0**
