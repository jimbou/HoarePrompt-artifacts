Output State: **t is an integer equal to the first integer from the first test case and must be greater than 0, idx is 3, results is an empty list, data contains the remaining test cases, _ is 0, n is an integer equal to the second integer from the first test case and must be greater than 0, v is a list of zeros with a length equal to n + 1, except for the element at index x which is equal to 1, where x is the integer value from the data at index 2.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `idx` is incremented by 1, making it 3. The `results` list remains empty as no elements are added to it. The `data` contains the remaining test cases, with the first test case being processed. The value of `_` remains 0 as it is not used in the code. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The list `v` has its element at index `x` incremented by 1, where `x` is the integer value from the `data` at index 2.
