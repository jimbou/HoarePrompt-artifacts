To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `n` is already greater than 0, we can conclude that the loop will execute. The variable `_` is the loop variable, which will take on the values from 0 to `n-1` during the loop execution.

State: **`t` is an integer equal to the first integer from the second test case and must be greater than 0, `idx` is `n` + 3, `results` is a list containing the string representation of the sum of `cnt` * `v[i]` * (`v[i]` - 1) // 2 for all `i` where `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, plus `v[i]` * (`v[i]` - 1) * (`v[i]` - 2) // 6 for all `i` where `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, `data` contains the remaining test cases, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer equal to the second integer from the first test case and must be greater than 0, `v` is a list of zeros with a length equal to `n` + 1, `i` is `n`, `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is 0**
