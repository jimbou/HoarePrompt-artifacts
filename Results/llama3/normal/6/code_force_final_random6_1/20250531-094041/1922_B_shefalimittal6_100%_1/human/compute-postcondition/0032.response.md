Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to the first integer from the first test case and must be greater than 0, `idx` is `n + 2`, `results` is a list containing the string representation of the sum of `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` for all `i` where `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, plus `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` for all `i` where `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, `data` contains the remaining test cases, `_` is `n - 1`, `n` is an integer equal to the second integer from the first test case and must be greater than 0, `v` is a list of zeros with a length equal to `n + 1`, except for the element at index `x` which is equal to `n`, where `x` is the integer value from the `data` at index 2, `i` is `n`, `cnt` is equal to the sum of all elements in `v`, and `ans` is the sum of `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` for all `i` where `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, plus `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` for all `i` where `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the `results` list now contains the string representation of the calculated `ans` value. All other variables remain unchanged.
