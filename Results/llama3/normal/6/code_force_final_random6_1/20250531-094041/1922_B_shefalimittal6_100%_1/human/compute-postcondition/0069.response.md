The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer equal to the first integer from the second test case and must be greater than n + 1, `idx` is `n` + `n` + 5, `results` is a list containing the string representation of the sum of `cnt` * `v[i]` * (`v[i]` - 1) // 2 for all `i` where `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, plus `v[i]` * (`v[i]` - 1) * (`v[i]` - 2) // 6 for all `i` where `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, and the string representation of `ans`, `data` contains the remaining test cases, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer equal to the value at index `idx` - 2 in `data` and must be greater than 1, `v` is a list of zeros with a length equal to `n` + 1, except for `v[x]` which is 1, `i` is `n`, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is 0, and `x` is an integer equal to the value at index `idx` - 1 in `data`**
