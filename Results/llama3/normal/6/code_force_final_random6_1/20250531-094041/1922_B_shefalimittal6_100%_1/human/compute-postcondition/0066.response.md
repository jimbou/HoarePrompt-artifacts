Output State: **t is an integer equal to the first integer from the second test case and must be greater than n + 1, idx is n + n + 4, results is a list containing the string representation of the sum of cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2 for all i where v[i] is greater than or equal to 2, plus v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6 for all i where v[i] is greater than or equal to 3, and the string representation of ans, data contains the remaining test cases, _ is n + 1, n is an integer equal to the value at index idx - 1 in data and must be greater than 0, v is a list of zeros with a length equal to n + 1, i is n, cnt is 0, ans is 0, and x is an integer equal to the value at index idx - 2 in data.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `n`, `idx`, `v`, `cnt`, and `ans`. The first line assigns the value at index `idx - 1` in `data` to `n`, which is an integer greater than 0. The second line increments `idx` by 1. The third line creates a new list `v` of zeros with a length equal to `n + 1`. The values of `cnt` and `ans` are not explicitly updated in the code snippet, but since `v` is a new list of zeros, `cnt` becomes 0 and `ans` becomes 0. The value of `x` is not modified in the code snippet, so it remains an integer equal to the value at index `idx - 2` in `data`. The values of `t`, `results`, `data`, and `_` are not modified in the code snippet, so they remain the same.
