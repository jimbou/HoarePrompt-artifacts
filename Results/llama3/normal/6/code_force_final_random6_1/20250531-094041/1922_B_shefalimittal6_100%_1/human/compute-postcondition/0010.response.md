Output State: **t is an integer equal to the first integer from the first test case and must be greater than 0, idx is n + 2, results is an empty list, data contains the remaining test cases, _ is n - 1, n is an integer equal to the second integer from the first test case and must be greater than 0, v is a list of zeros with a length equal to n + 1, except for the element at index x which is equal to n, where x is the integer value from the data at index 2, cnt is 0, ans is 0**

The code snippet initializes two new variables, `cnt` and `ans`, and assigns them both the value 0. The rest of the variables remain unchanged, as the code does not modify them. The final state includes the initial state's information and the new variables `cnt` and `ans` with their assigned values.
