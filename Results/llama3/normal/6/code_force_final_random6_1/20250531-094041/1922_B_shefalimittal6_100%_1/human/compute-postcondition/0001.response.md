The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin is empty, t is an integer equal to the first integer from the first test case, idx is 1, results is an empty list, data contains the remaining test cases does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and `_` is now 0.
State: **stdin is empty, t is an integer equal to the first integer from the first test case and must be greater than 0, idx is 1, results is an empty list, data contains the remaining test cases, _ is 0**
