Output State: **t is an integer equal to the first integer from the second test case and must be greater than 0, idx is n + n + 3, results is a list containing the string representation of the sum of cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2 for all i where v[i] is greater than or equal to 2, plus v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6 for all i where v[i] is greater than or equal to 3, data contains the remaining test cases, _ is n, n is an integer equal to the second integer from the first test case and must be greater than 0, v is a list of zeros with a length equal to n + 1, where v[x] is equal to the number of times x appears in the test cases, i is n, cnt is 0, and ans is 0, and x is an integer equal to the value at index idx - 1 in data.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed n times, where n is the second integer from the first test case. The variable idx has been incremented n times, and the list v has been updated to reflect the frequency of each number in the test cases. The variable x holds the last value read from the data, and the other variables remain unchanged.
