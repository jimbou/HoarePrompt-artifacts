The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 and `t` must be greater than 0.
State: **`t` is an integer equal to the first integer from the second test case and must be greater than 0, `idx` is `n + 2`, `results` is a list containing the string representation of the sum of `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` for all `i` where `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, plus `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` for all `i` where `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, `data` contains the remaining test cases, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer equal to the second integer from the first test case and must be greater than 0, `v` is a list of zeros with a length equal to `n + 1`, except for the element at index `x` which is equal to `n`, where `x` is the integer value from the `data` at index 2, `i` is `n`, `cnt` is equal to the sum of all elements in `v`, and `ans` is the sum of `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` for all `i` where `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, plus `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` for all `i` where `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3.**
