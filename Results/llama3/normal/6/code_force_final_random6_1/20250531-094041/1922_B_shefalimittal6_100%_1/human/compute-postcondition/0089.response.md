The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n` + 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer equal to the first integer from the second test case and must be greater than `n` + 1, `idx` is `n` + `n` + `n` + 4, `results` is a list containing the string representation of the sum of `cnt` * `v[i]` * (`v[i]` - 1) // 2 for all `i` where `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, plus `v[i]` * (`v[i]` - 1) * (`v[i]` - 2) // 6 for all `i` where `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, and the string representation of `ans`, `data` contains the remaining test cases, `_` is `n`, `n` is an integer equal to the value at index `idx` - `n` - 1 in `data` and must be greater than 1, `v` is a list of zeros with a length equal to `n` + 1, except for `v[x]` which is `n`, `i` is 2, `cnt` is `v[0]` + `v[1]`, `ans` is either `v[0]` * `v[0]` * (`v[0]` - 1) // 2 + `cnt` * `v[i]` * (`v[i]` - 1) // 2 or `v[0]` * `v[0]` * (`v[0]` - 1) // 2 + `v[0]` * (`v[0]` - 1) * (`v[0]` - 2) // 6 + `cnt` * `v[i]` * (`v[i]` - 1) // 2 depending on whether `v[0]` is less than 3 or not, and `x` is an integer equal to the value at index `idx` - `n` in `data`. If `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is updated to include the sum of `cnt` * `v[i]` * (`v[i]` - 1) // 2 + `v[i]` * (`v[i]` - 1) * (`v[i]` - 2) // 6. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
