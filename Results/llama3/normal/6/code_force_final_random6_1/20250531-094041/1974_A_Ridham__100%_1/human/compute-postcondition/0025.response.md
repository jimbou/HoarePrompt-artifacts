Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `result` is a list containing either the value of `screen_require_for_y` or the sum of `screen_require_for_y` and `extra_screen`, `remaining_cells` is 11 times `screen_require_for_y` minus 4 times `y`, stdin contains t-2 inputs: each input is a pair of integers x and y, x is an integer, y is an integer, `space_x` is x, `space_y` is 4y, `total_space` is 5x. If y is even, `screen_require_for_y` is y // 2 and `remaining_cells` is 15 * `screen_require_for_y` - 4y. If y is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is y // 2 + 1 and `remaining_cells` is 15 * (`screen_require_for_y`) - 4y. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, the current value of `space_x` is less than or equal to the current value of `remaining_cells` and `result` contains the value of `screen_require_for_y`. If `space_x` is larger than `remaining_cells`, `extra_space` is `space_x` - `remaining_cells`. If `extra_space` is divisible by 15, `extra_screen` is `extra_space` divided by 15. Otherwise, `extra_screen` is (`space_x` - `remaining_cells`) // 15 + 1 and `result` contains the sum of `screen_require_for_y` and `extra_screen`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but with the additional information that `remaining_cells` is now equal to 11 times `screen_require_for_y` minus 4 times `y`. The values of the other variables remain the same, and the conditions for `result` and `extra_screen` are still dependent on the values of `space_x`, `remaining_cells`, and `extra_space`.
