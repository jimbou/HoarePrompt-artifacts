Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 2, `result` is a list containing either the value of `screen_require_for_y` or the sum of `screen_require_for_y` and `extra_screen`, `remaining_cells` is 15 times `screen_require_for_y` minus `space_y`, `space_x` is `x`, `space_y` is `4y`, `total_space` is `5x`, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `extra_space` is `x - (15 times `screen_require_for_y` minus `4y`). If `extra_space` is a multiple of 15, then `extra_screen` is `extra_space` divided by 15. Otherwise, `extra_screen` is `extra_space` divided by 15 plus 1.***
