Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `stdin` contains t-1 inputs: each input is a pair of integers x and y, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `space_x` is x, `space_y` is 4y, `total_space` is 5x. If y is even, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer and `remaining_cells` is 15 * `screen_require_for_y` - 4y. If y is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is y // 2 + 1 and `remaining_cells` is 15 * (y // 2 + 1) - 4y. `space_x` is larger than `remaining_cells`, `extra_space` is `space_x` - `remaining_cells`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `extra_space` which is calculated as the difference between `space_x` and `remaining_cells`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
