Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 0, result is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 inputs: each input is a pair of integers x and y, x is an integer, y is an integer, space_x is x, space_y is 4y, total_space is 5x. If y is even, screen_require_for_y is an integer. If y is odd, screen_require_for_y is y // 2 + 1.***
