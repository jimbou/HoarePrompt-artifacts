Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, result is an empty list, stdin contains t inputs: each input is a pair of integers x and y
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
    space_x = x * 1
    space_y = y * 4
    total_space = space_y + space_x
    if y % 2 == 0:
        screen_require_for_y = y // 2
    else:
        screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1
    remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y
    if space_x <= remaining_cells:
        result.append(screen_require_for_y)
    else:
        extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells
        if extra_space % 15 == 0:
            extra_screen = extra_space // 15
        else:
            extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1
        result.append(extra_screen + screen_require_for_y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `result` is a list containing either the value of `screen_require_for_y` or the sum of `screen_require_for_y` and `extra_screen`, `stdin` contains t-2 inputs: each input is a pair of integers x and y, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `space_x` is x, `space_y` is 4y, `total_space` is 5x. If y is even, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer and `remaining_cells` = 15 * `screen_require_for_y` - 4y. If y is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is y // 2 + 1 and `remaining_cells` = 15 * (y // 2 + 1) - 4y. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, the current value of `space_x` is less than or equal to the current value of `remaining_cells` and `result` contains the value of `screen_require_for_y`. If `space_x` is larger than `remaining_cells`, `extra_space` is `space_x` - `remaining_cells`. If `extra_space` is divisible by 15, `extra_screen` is `extra_space` divided by 15. Otherwise, `extra_screen` is (`space_x` - `remaining_cells`) // 15 + 1 and `result` contains the sum of `screen_require_for_y` and `extra_screen`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 1, `result` is a list containing either the value of `screen_require_for_y` or the sum of `screen_require_for_y` and `extra_screen`, `remaining_cells` is 11 times `screen_require_for_y` minus 4 times `y` or 15 * `screen_require_for_y` - 4y, stdin contains t-3 inputs: each input is a pair of integers x and y, x is an integer, y is an integer, `space_x` is x, `space_y` is 4y, `total_space` is 5x. If y is even, `screen_require_for_y` is y // 2 and `remaining_cells` is 15 * `screen_require_for_y` - 4y. If y is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is y // 2 + 1 and `remaining_cells` is 15 * (`screen_require_for_y`) - 4y. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, the current value of `space_x` is less than or equal to the current value of `remaining_cells` and `result` contains the value of `screen_require_for_y`. If `space_x` is larger than `remaining_cells`, `extra_space` is `space_x` - `remaining_cells`. If `extra_space` is divisible by 15, `extra_screen` is `extra_space` divided by 15. Otherwise, `extra_screen` is (`space_x` - `remaining_cells`) // 15 + 1 and `result` contains the sum of `screen_require_for_y` and `extra_screen

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 2, `result` is a list containing either the value of `screen_require_for_y`, the sum of `screen_require_for_y` and `extra_screen`, and `screen_require_for_y`. `remaining_cells` is 15 times `screen_require_for_y` minus `space_y`, `space_x` is `x`, `space_y` is `4y`, `total_space` is `5x`, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer. If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`. If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, then `result` contains either the value of `screen_require_for_y` or the sum of `screen_require_for_y` and `extra_screen`, and `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, `result` contains either the value of `screen_require_for_y` or the sum of `screen_require_for_y` and `extra_screen`, and also contains the value of `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`. In the latter case, `extra_space` is `x - (15 times `screen_require_for_y` minus `4y`). If `extra_space` is a multiple of 15, then `extra_screen` is `extra_space` divided by 15. Otherwise, `extra_screen` is `extra_space` divided by 15 plus 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
