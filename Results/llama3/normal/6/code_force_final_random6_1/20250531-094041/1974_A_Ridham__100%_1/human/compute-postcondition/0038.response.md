Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `result` is a list containing either the value of `screen_require_for_y` or the sum of `screen_require_for_y` and `extra_screen`, `remaining_cells` is 15 times `screen_require_for_y` minus `space_y`, `space_x` is `x`, `space_y` is `4y`, `total_space` is `5x`, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer. If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`. If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1`.**

In this output state, the value of `remaining_cells` has been updated to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, which is a new expression based on the values of `screen_require_for_y` and `space_y`. The other variables remain unchanged, and their values are still dependent on the initial conditions.
