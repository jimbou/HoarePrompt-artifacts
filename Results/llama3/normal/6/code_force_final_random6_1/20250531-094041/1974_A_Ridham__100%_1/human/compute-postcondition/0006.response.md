Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer equal to `y // 2 + 1`, `x` is an integer, `y` is an odd integer, `space_x` is `x`, `space_y` is `4y`, `total_space` is `5x`, and stdin contains t-1 inputs: each input is a pair of integers x and y**.

In this output state, the value of `screen_require_for_y` is calculated based on the value of `y`, which is an odd integer. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains t-1 inputs, each consisting of a pair of integers x and y.
