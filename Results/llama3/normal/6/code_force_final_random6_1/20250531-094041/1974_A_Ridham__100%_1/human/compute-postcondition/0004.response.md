Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer, `space_x` is x, `space_y` is 4y, `total_space` is 5x, stdin contains t-1 inputs: each input is a pair of integers x and y, x is an integer, y is an integer, and the current value of y is even.**

In this output state, the value of `screen_require_for_y` is calculated by performing integer division of `y` by 2, resulting in an integer value. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains t-1 inputs. The current value of y is still even, as it was in the initial state.
