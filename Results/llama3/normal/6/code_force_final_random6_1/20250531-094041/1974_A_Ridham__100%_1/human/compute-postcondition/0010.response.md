Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `result` is a list containing the value of `screen_require_for_y`, `stdin` contains t-2 inputs: each input is a pair of integers x and y, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `space_x` is x, `space_y` is 4y, `total_space` is 5x. If y is even, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer and `remaining_cells` = 15 * `screen_require_for_y` - 4y. If y is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is y // 2 + 1 and `remaining_cells` = 15 * (y // 2 + 1) - 4y. The current value of `space_x` is less than or equal to the current value of `remaining_cells`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `screen_require_for_y` has been appended to the `result` list. The number of inputs in `stdin` has decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged, with their values still satisfying the given conditions.
