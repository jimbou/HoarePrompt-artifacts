This function reads t+1 inputs from stdin, where t is an integer followed by t pairs of integers x and y. It calculates the minimum number of screens required to display each pair of integers, considering the space requirements for x and y, and appends the result to a list. The function then prints the list of results, one value per line, and leaves stdin empty.
