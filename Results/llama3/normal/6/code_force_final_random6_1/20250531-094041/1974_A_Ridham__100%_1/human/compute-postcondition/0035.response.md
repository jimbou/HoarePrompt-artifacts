Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `result` is a list containing either the value of `screen_require_for_y` or the sum of `screen_require_for_y` and `extra_screen`, `remaining_cells` is 11 times `screen_require_for_y` minus 4 times `y` or 15 * `screen_require_for_y` - 4y, `space_x` is `x`, `space_y` is 4y, `total_space` is 5x, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`**

In this output state, the value of `screen_require_for_y` has been updated to be the integer division of `y` by 2. The other variables remain unchanged, and their values are still dependent on the initial state.
