The code prints the elements of the `result` list, each on a new line. The `result` list contains either the value of `screen_require_for_y` or the sum of `screen_require_for_y` and `extra_screen` for each input pair of integers x and y.

Since `n` is an integer equal to 0, it is likely that the input pairs of integers x and y are not provided, and therefore, the `result` list is empty.

Output: **(nothing, an empty output)**
