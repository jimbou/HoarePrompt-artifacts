Output State: **n is an integer greater than 2, result is a list containing either the value of screen_require_for_y or the sum of screen_require_for_y and extra_screen, remaining_cells is 11 times screen_require_for_y minus 4 times y or 15 * screen_require_for_y - 4y, space_x is x, space_y is 4y, total_space is 5x, x is an integer, y is an integer.**

The code snippet reads a pair of integers x and y from stdin, assigns x to space_x, and calculates space_y as 4 times y and total_space as the sum of space_x and space_y. The values of n, result, remaining_cells, screen_require_for_y, and extra_screen are not affected by the code. The state of stdin is not included in the output state as it is empty after the code execution.
