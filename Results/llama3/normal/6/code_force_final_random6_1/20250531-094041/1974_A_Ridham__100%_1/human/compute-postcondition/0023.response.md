Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `result` is a list containing either the value of `screen_require_for_y` or the sum of `screen_require_for_y` and `extra_screen`, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1`, `stdin` contains `t-2` inputs: each input is a pair of integers `x` and `y`, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `space_x` is `x`, `space_y` is `4y`, `total_space` is `5x`. If `y` is even, `remaining_cells` is `15 * screen_require_for_y - 4y`. If `y` is odd, `remaining_cells` is `15 * (y // 2 + 1) - 4y`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, the current value of `space_x` is less than or equal to the current value of `remaining_cells` and `result` contains the value of `screen_require_for_y`. If `space_x` is larger than `remaining_cells`, `extra_space` is `space_x - remaining_cells`. If `extra_space` is divisible by 15, `extra_screen` is `extra_space` divided by 15. Otherwise, `extra_screen` is `(space_x - remaining_cells) // 15 + 1` and `result` contains the sum of `screen_require_for_y` and `extra_screen`.**

In this output state, the value of `screen_require_for_y` has been updated to `y // 2 + 1`, which is the new value assigned by the code. The other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
