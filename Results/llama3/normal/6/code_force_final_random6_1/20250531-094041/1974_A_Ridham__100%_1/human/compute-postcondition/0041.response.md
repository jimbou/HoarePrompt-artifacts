Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `result` is a list containing either the value of `screen_require_for_y` or the sum of `screen_require_for_y` and `extra_screen`, `remaining_cells` is 15 times `screen_require_for_y` minus `space_y`, `space_x` is `x`, `space_y` is `4y`, `total_space` is `5x`, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `extra_space` is `x - (15 times `screen_require_for_y` minus `4y`), `extra_screen` is (`x - (15 times `screen_require_for_y` minus `4y`) ) // 15**

In this output state, the value of `extra_screen` is calculated by performing integer division of `extra_space` by 15. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
