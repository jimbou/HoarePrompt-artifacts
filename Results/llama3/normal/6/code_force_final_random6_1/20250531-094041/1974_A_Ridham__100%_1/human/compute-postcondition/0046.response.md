Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to 0, `result` is a list containing either the value of `screen_require_for_y` or the sum of `screen_require_for_y` and `extra_screen` for each input pair of integers x and y, `stdin` is empty.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `n` will be 0, indicating that all inputs have been processed. The `result` list will contain the calculated values for each input pair of integers x and y, which can be either the value of `screen_require_for_y` or the sum of `screen_require_for_y` and `extra_screen`. The `stdin` will be empty, as all inputs have been consumed by the loop.
