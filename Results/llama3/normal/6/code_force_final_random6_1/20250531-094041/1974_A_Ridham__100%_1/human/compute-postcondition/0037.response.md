Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 2, result is a list containing either the value of screen_require_for_y or the sum of screen_require_for_y and extra_screen, remaining_cells is 11 times screen_require_for_y minus 4 times y or 15 * screen_require_for_y - 4y, space_x is x, space_y is 4y, total_space is 5x, x is an integer, y is an integer. If y is even, screen_require_for_y is y // 2. If y is odd, screen_require_for_y is y // 2 + 1.***
