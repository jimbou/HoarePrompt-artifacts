Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `result` is a list containing one element which is the sum of `screen_require_for_y` and `extra_screen`, `stdin` contains t-2 inputs: each input is a pair of integers x and y, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `space_x` is x, `space_y` is 4y, `total_space` is 5x. If y is even, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer and `remaining_cells` is 15 * `screen_require_for_y` - 4y. If y is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is y // 2 + 1 and `remaining_cells` is 15 * (y // 2 + 1) - 4y. `space_x` is larger than `remaining_cells`, `extra_space` is `space_x` - `remaining_cells`. If `extra_space` is divisible by 15, `extra_screen` is `extra_space` divided by 15. Otherwise, `extra_screen` is (`space_x` - `remaining_cells`) // 15 + 1.**

In natural language, the output state is that the list `result` now contains one element which is the sum of the required screens for y and the extra screens that can be accommodated with the extra space. The values of other variables remain the same, but the number of inputs in `stdin` has decreased by 1.
