Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, result is a list containing either the value of screen_require_for_y or the sum of screen_require_for_y and extra_screen, stdin contains t-2 inputs: each input is a pair of integers x and y, x is an integer, y is an integer, space_x is x, space_y is 4y, total_space is 5x. If y is even, screen_require_for_y is an integer and remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - 4y. If y is odd, screen_require_for_y is y // 2 + 1 and remaining_cells = 15 * (y // 2 + 1) - 4y. If space_x is less than or equal to remaining_cells, the current value of space_x is less than or equal to the current value of remaining_cells and result contains the value of screen_require_for_y. If space_x is larger than remaining_cells, extra_space is space_x - remaining_cells. If extra_space is divisible by 15, extra_screen is extra_space divided by 15. Otherwise, extra_screen is (space_x - remaining_cells) // 15 + 1 and result contains the sum of screen_require_for_y and extra_screen.**
