Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, result is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 inputs: each input is a pair of integers x and y, x is an integer, y is an integer, space_x is x, space_y is 4y, total_space is 5x. If y is even, screen_require_for_y is an integer and remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - 4y. If y is odd, screen_require_for_y is y // 2 + 1 and remaining_cells = 15 * (y // 2 + 1) - 4y.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of n remains the same, which is an integer greater than 0. The result list is still empty. The stdin still contains t-1 inputs, each being a pair of integers x and y. The values of space_x, space_y, and total_space remain the same, which are x, 4y, and 5x respectively. The value of screen_require_for_y remains the same, which is an integer if y is even and y // 2 + 1 if y is odd. The new variable remaining_cells is calculated based on the value of screen_require_for_y and space_y. If y is even, remaining_cells is 15 times screen_require_for_y minus 4y. If y is odd, remaining_cells is 15 times (y // 2 + 1) minus 4y.
