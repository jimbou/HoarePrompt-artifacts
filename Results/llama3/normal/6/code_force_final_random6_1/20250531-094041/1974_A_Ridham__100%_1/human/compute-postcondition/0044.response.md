Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `result` is a list containing either the value of `screen_require_for_y` or the sum of `screen_require_for_y` and `extra_screen`, and also contains the value of `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, `remaining_cells` is 15 times `screen_require_for_y` minus `space_y`, `space_x` is `x`, `space_y` is `4y`, `total_space` is `5x`, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `extra_space` is `x - (15 times `screen_require_for_y` minus `4y`). If `extra_space` is a multiple of 15, then `extra_screen` is `extra_space` divided by 15. Otherwise, `extra_screen` is `extra_space` divided by 15 plus 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but with the `result` list updated to include the value of `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`. All other variables remain unchanged.
