Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of cells that need to be colored in a square grid of size n x n to ensure that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell.

The program uses a mathematical expression to calculate the minimum number of cells that need to be colored. The expression involves the variables n and k, which represent the size of the square grid and the minimum number of diagonals with at least one colored cell, respectively.

The expression is based on the observation that the minimum number of cells that need to be colored is equal to the number of diagonals that need to be colored, which is k // 2 + k % 2, multiplied by a factor that depends on whether k is less than 4n - 3 or not. If k is less than 4n - 3, the factor is 1, and if k is greater than or equal to 4n - 3, the factor is 2n. Additionally, if k is equal to 4n - 2, the program adds 1 to the result.

The program reads input from standard input, where the first line contains the number of test cases, and each subsequent line contains two integers representing the size of a square grid and the minimum number of diagonals with at least one colored cell. It then prints the result of the mathematical expression for each test case.

Based on the execution summary, the program processes all test cases and outputs the results accordingly.

Correctness: **True**
