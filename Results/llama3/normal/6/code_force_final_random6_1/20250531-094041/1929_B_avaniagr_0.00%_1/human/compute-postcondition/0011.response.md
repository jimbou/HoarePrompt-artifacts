Output: **`n` and `k` are integers, `s` is the fourth line of input, stdin contains multiple lines of input that must have at least 1 line, and this is printed: the value of the expression `(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2)` which is a mathematical expression involving the values of `k` and `n`**
