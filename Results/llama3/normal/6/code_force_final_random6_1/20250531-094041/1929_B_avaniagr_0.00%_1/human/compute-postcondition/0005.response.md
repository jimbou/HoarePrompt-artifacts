Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers, `s` is the third line of input, stdin contains multiple lines of input that must have at least 1 line**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` have been updated to be the two integers from the third line of input, which is stored in `s`. The stdin still contains multiple lines of input, but now it has at least one line, since the third line has been read and processed.
