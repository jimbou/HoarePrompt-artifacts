#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^8, 1 <= k <= 4n - 2) representing the size of the square grid and the minimum number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        n, k = map(int, s.split())
        
        print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k ==
            4 * n - 2))
        
    #State: The loop iterates over the remaining lines of input, and for each line, it prints the value of the expression `(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2)` which is a mathematical expression involving the values of `k` and `n`. The loop continues until all lines of input have been processed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from standard input, where the first line contains the number of test cases, and each subsequent line contains two integers representing the size of a square grid and the minimum number of diagonals with at least one colored cell. It then prints the result of a mathematical expression involving these integers for each test case. The function processes all test cases and outputs the results accordingly.
