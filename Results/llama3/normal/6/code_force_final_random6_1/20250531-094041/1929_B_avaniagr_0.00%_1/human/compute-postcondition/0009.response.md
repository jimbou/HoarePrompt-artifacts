Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers, `s` is the fourth line of input, stdin contains multiple lines of input that must have at least 1 line**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` are updated to be the integers obtained by splitting the fourth line of input `s` into two parts. The stdin still contains multiple lines of input, but now it has at least one line left, as the fourth line has been consumed to update the values of `n` and `k`.
