Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^8, 1 <= k <= 4n - 2) representing the size of the square grid and the minimum number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.
Code of the loop:
for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
    n, k = map(int, s.split())
    print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (
        k == 4 * n - 2))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` and `k` are integers, `s` is the second line of input, stdin contains multiple lines of input that must have at least 1 line, and this is printed: The value of the expression `(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2)` which is an integer value depending on the values of `n` and `k`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` and `k` are integers, `s` is the third line of input, stdin contains multiple lines of input that must have at least 1 line, and this is printed: the value of the expression `(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` and `k` are integers, `s` is the fourth line of input, stdin contains multiple lines of input that must have at least 1 line, and this is printed: the value of the expression `(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2)` which is a mathematical expression involving the values of `k` and `n`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
