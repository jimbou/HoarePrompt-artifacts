stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) â€” the number of test cases. Each of the following lines contains two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^8, 1 <= k <= 4n - 2) â€” the size of the square grid and the minimum number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.
