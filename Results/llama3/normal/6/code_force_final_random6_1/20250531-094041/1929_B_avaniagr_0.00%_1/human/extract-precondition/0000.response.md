Precondition: **stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^8, 1 <= k <= 4n - 2) representing the size of the square grid and the minimum number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.**
