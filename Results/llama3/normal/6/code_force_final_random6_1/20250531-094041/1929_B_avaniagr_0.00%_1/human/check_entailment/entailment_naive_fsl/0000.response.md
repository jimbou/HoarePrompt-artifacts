Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of cells that need to be colored in the square grid to have at least k diagonals with at least one colored cell.

The program uses the fact that the number of diagonals in a square grid of size n x n is 4n - 2. It then checks if k is less than 4n - 3. If it is, it calculates the minimum number of cells to be colored as (k // 2 + k % 2), which is the minimum number of cells needed to color k diagonals. If k is greater than or equal to 4n - 3, it calculates the minimum number of cells to be colored as 2n, which is the minimum number of cells needed to color all diagonals.

The program also handles the edge case where k is equal to 4n - 2, in which case it prints 2n.

The program's logic is correct and it handles all possible cases, therefore it is correct.
