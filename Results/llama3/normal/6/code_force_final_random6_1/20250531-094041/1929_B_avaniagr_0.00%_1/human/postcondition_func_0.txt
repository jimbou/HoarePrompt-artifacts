This function reads input from standard input, where the first line contains the number of test cases, and each subsequent line contains two integers representing the size of a square grid and the minimum number of diagonals with at least one colored cell. It then prints the result of a mathematical expression involving these integers for each test case. The function processes all test cases and outputs the results accordingly.
