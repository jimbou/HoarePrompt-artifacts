Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers, `s` is the second line of input, stdin contains multiple lines of input that must have at least 1 line**

In this output state, `n` and `k` are assigned the values of the two integers from the second line of input, which is stored in the variable `s`. The second line of input is split into two integers using the `split()` method, and these integers are converted to integers using the `map(int, ...)` function. The values of `n` and `k` are now specific integers, but their exact values depend on the input. The variable `s` still holds the second line of input, and the stdin still contains multiple lines of input, but at least one line has been consumed by the `input()` function.
