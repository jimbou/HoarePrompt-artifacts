Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n` with the first `k` elements being equal, `l` is `k`, `r` is equal to `k`, `st` is `k`, `end` is equal to `r - k + 1`, `ans` is equal to `r - l - 1` which is `k - k - 1` which is `-1`, stdin is empty, and the first and last elements of `a` are equal.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of elements `n` is still greater than 1, the list `a` still contains `n` integers between 1 and `n` with the first `k` elements being equal, the left and right pointers `l` and `r` are still equal to `k`, the start and end indices `st` and `end` are still equal to `k` and `r - k + 1` respectively, the answer `ans` is now calculated as `-1` since `r` and `l` are equal to `k`, the standard input is still empty, and the first and last elements of the list `a` are still equal.
