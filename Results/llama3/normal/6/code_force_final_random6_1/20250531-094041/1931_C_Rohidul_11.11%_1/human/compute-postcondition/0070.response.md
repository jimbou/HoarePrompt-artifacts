Postcondition: **n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers where the first and last elements are equal (a[0] == a[-1]), and all elements up to index l are equal (a[0] == a[1] == ... == a[l]), l is equal to r, r is greater than or equal to 0, the current value of st is r, the current value of end is r + 1, and stdin is empty.**
