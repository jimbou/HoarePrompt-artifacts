The code block consists of two lines. The first line increments the value of `l` by 1. Since `l` was initially 0, it becomes 1. The second line increments the value of `st` by 1. Since `st` was initially 0, it becomes 1.

No other variables are affected by the code block. The value of `n` remains an integer greater than 1, `a` remains a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n` with the first two elements being equal, `r` remains `n-1`, and `end` remains 0. Stdin remains empty.

Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers between 1 and n with the first two elements being equal, l is 1, r is n-1, st is 1, end is 0, stdin is empty**
