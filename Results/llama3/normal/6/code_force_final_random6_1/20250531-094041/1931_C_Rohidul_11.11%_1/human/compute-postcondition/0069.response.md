Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers where a[0] == a[1] == ... == a[l], l is equal to r, r is greater than or equal to 0, st is r, end is equal to r + 1, stdin is empty**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: the list 'a' has been traversed from the end to the beginning until a pair of adjacent elements with different values was found, or until the beginning of the list was reached. The variable 'r' points to the last element of the list that has the same value as the first element, and the variable 'end' points to the first element of the list that has a different value than the first element, or to the beginning of the list if no such element was found.
