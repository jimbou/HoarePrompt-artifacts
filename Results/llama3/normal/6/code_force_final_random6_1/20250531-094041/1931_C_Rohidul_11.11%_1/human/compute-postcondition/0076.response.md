Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0]` == `a[1]` == ... == `a[l]`, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is greater than or equal to 0, `st` is `r`, `end` is equal to `r + 1`, `ans` is 0, stdin is empty, and the first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a`. Additionally, either `st` is not equal to 0, or `end` is not equal to 0, or the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `a` has `n` integers where the first `l` elements are equal. The variables `l` and `r` are equal, and `st` and `end` are `r` and `r+1` respectively. The variable `ans` is 0, which is the difference between `r` and `l`. The standard input is empty. The first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a`. Also, either `st` is not 0, or `end` is not 0, or the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`.
