Output: **n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers between 1 and n starting with at least k identical integers, l is k-1, r is greater than or equal to k-1, st is k-1, end is the number of times the loop executes, stdin is empty. If the first and last elements of a are equal, then ans is r - (k-1) - 1 which is greater than or equal to 0. If the first and last elements of a are not equal, then if st is 0, end is 0, and ans is n-1. Otherwise, ans is greater than or equal to 0, and the maximum value between 0 and ans is printed**
