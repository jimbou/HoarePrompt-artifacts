Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers, l is 0, r is n - 1, st is 0, end is 0, stdin is empty**

The code snippet first reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`, making `n` equal to the input value. Then, it reads a list of `n` integers from stdin and assigns it to `a`, making `a` equal to the input list. The third line assigns 0 to `l` and `n - 1` to `r`, overwriting their previous values. The fourth line assigns 0 to `st` and 0 to `end`, overwriting their previous values. Stdin is now empty after reading the input values.
