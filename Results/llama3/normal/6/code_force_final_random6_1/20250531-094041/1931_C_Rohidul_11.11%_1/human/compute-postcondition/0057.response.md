The code snippet consists of two lines that modify the values of variables `l` and `st`. The first line increments `l` by 1, and the second line increments `st` by 1.

Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers where a[0] == a[1], l is 1, r is n - 1, st is 1, end is 0, stdin is empty**

In this final state, the value of `l` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `st` has also been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` still contains `n` integers with `a[0] == a[1]`, and `r` remains at `n - 1`. The `end` variable is still 0, and `stdin` remains empty.
