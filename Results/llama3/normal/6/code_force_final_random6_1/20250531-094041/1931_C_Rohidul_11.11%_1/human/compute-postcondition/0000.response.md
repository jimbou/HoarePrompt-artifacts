To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `_` and the input from `stdin`. Since the loop iterates over the range of the integer input from `stdin`, we need to ensure that this integer is at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **stdin contains multiple inputs: first an integer t that must be at least 1 (1 <= t <= 10^4), then for each test case, first an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n), _ is 0**
