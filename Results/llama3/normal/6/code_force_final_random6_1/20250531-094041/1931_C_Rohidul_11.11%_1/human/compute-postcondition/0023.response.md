Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n` starting with at least `k` identical integers, `l` is `k-1`, `r` is greater than or equal to `k-1`, stdin is empty. If `st` is 0, `end` is 0, and the first and last elements of `a` are not equal, then `ans` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `ans` is greater than or equal to 0.***
