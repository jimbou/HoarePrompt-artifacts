According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `r` and `l` and `a[r]` and `a[r-1]`. If `r` is greater than `l` and `a[r]` is equal to `a[r-1]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `r` is at least `k-1`, `l` is `k-1`, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n` starting with at least `k+1` identical integers. For the loop to execute one more time, `r` must be greater than `l`, so `r` must be at least `k`. Also, `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r-1]`, so `a` must have at least `k+2` identical integers at the start. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n` starting with at least `k+2` identical integers, `l` is `k-1`, `r` is at least `k`, `st` is `k-1`, `end` is 1, `stdin` is empty**
