Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0]` == `a[1]` == ... == `a[l]`, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is greater than or equal to 0, `st` is 0, `end` is 0, `ans` is `n-1`, and the first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a`, stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is set to `n-1`, which is the length of the list `a` minus 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` still has `n` integers, where the first `l` elements are equal, and `l` is equal to `r`. The variables `st` and `end` are still 0, and the first element of `a` is still not equal to the last element of `a`. The stdin is still empty.
