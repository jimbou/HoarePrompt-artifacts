The code reads an integer `n` from the input, then reads `n` integers from the input and stores them in the list `a`. It then initializes four variables: `l` and `r` to 0 and `n-1` respectively, and `st` and `end` to 0.

After the code executes, the input will have been consumed, so stdin will be empty. The variable `n` will hold the value of the first integer read from the input, which is at least 1 and at most 10^4. The variable `a` will hold a list of `n` integers, each between 1 and `n`. The variables `l` and `r` will hold the values 0 and `n-1` respectively, and the variables `st` and `end` will hold the value 0.

Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^4, a is a list of n integers between 1 and n, l is 0, r is n-1, st is 0, end is 0, stdin is empty**
