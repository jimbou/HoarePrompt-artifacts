Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers between 1 and n with the first k elements being equal, l is k, r is greater than k, a[r] is equal to a[r-1], a[r-1] is equal to a[r-2], st is k, end is 3, stdin is empty**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line decrements the value of `r` by 1, making `r` equal to its previous value minus 1. The second line increments the value of `end` by 1, making `end` equal to 3. No other variables are affected by the code.
