The variables in the loop head are r and l and a[r] and a[r - 1], so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables r and l and a[r] and a[r - 1]. If r is greater than l and a[r] is equal to a[r - 1], the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, r is n - 2, l is less than r, a[r] is equal to a[r - 1] because a[0] == a[1] == ... == a[r]. r being n - 2 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to r is greater than l. l being less than r does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to l is less than r - 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers where a[0] == a[1] == ... == a[r], l is less than r - 1, r is greater than l, st is r + 1, end is 1, stdin is empty**
