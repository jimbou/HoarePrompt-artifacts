Output State: **n is an integer greater than 3, a is a list of at least 4 integers where a[0] == a[1] == a[2] == a[3], l is 3, r is greater than 2, st is 3, end is 0, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `a`, `r`, `end`, and `stdin` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `l` is incremented by 1, making it 3, and the value of `st` is also incremented by 1, making it 3.
