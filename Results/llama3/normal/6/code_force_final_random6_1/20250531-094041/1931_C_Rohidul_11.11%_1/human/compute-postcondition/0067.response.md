According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `r`, `l`, and `a`. If `r` is greater than `l` and `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `r` is greater than `l`, `l` is less than `r - 1`, `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]`, and `a[0] == a[1] == ... == a[r]`. For the loop to execute again, `r` must be greater than `l`, and `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`. Since `a[0] == a[1] == ... == a[r]`, we can conclude that `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]`. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `l`, which must be less than `r - 1` to ensure that `r` is greater than `l`.

State: **n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers where a[0] == a[1] == ... == a[r], l is less than r - 1, r is greater than l + 1, st is r, end is 2, stdin is empty**
