Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n` starting with at least `k` identical integers, `l` is `k-1`, `r` is greater than or equal to `k-1`, `st` is 0, `end` is 0, `ans` is `n-1`, stdin is empty. The first and last elements of `a` are not equal.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been calculated and assigned the value of `n-1`, which is the length of list `a` minus 1. All other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin remains empty. The list `a` still contains `n` integers between 1 and `n`, starting with at least `k` identical integers, and its first and last elements are still not equal.
