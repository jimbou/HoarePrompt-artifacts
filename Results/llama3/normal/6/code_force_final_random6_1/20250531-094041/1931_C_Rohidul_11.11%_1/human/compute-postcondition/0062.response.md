Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers where a[0] == a[1] == ... == a[r], l is r, r is n - 1, st is r, end is 0, stdin is empty**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a state where the loop has iterated over all the equal elements at the beginning of the list `a`. The variable `l` has moved to the last index of the equal elements, which is also the value of `r`. The variable `st` has counted the number of equal elements, which is also the value of `r`. The other variables remain unchanged.
