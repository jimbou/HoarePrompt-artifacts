The `print(max(0, ans))` statement will print the maximum value between 0 and `ans`.

Since `l` is equal to `r`, and `st` is equal to `r`, and `end` is equal to `r + 1`, we can deduce that `st` is not equal to 0 and `end` is not equal to 0.

Given that `a[0] == a[1] == ... == a[l]`, we can conclude that the first and last elements of `a` are equal.

Therefore, `ans` is equal to `r - l - 1`.

Since `r` is greater than or equal to 0, and `l` is equal to `r`, we can deduce that `r - l - 1` is greater than or equal to -1.

However, since `n` is an integer greater than 1, and `a` is a list of `n` integers, we can conclude that `r - l - 1` is less than `n`.

Therefore, `max(0, ans)` will print the value of `ans`, which is `r - l - 1`.

Output: **r - l - 1 (where r - l - 1 is the value of ans)**
