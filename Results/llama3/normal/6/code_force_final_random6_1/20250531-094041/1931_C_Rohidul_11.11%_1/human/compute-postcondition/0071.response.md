Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first and last elements are equal (`a[0] == a[-1]`), and all elements up to index `l` are equal (`a[0] == a[1] == ... == a[l]`), `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is greater than or equal to 0, the current value of `st` is `r`, the current value of `end` is `r + 1`, `ans` is equal to `r - l - 1`, and stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `a` has `n` integers with the first and last elements being the same, and all elements up to index `l` are the same. The values of `l` and `r` are equal, and `r` is greater than or equal to 0. The variables `st` and `end` have values `r` and `r + 1` respectively. A new variable `ans` is introduced, which is equal to `r - l - 1`. The input stream is empty.
