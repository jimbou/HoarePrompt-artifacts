Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n` starting with at least `k` identical integers, `l` is `k-1`, `r` is greater than or equal to `k-1`, `st` is not equal to 0 or `end` is not equal to 0 or the first and last elements of `a` are equal, `ans` is greater than or equal to 0, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `ans` is calculated as `r - l`, where `r` is greater than or equal to `k-1` and `l` is `k-1`. Therefore, `ans` is greater than or equal to 0. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
