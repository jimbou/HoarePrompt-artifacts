Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers between 1 and n, l is equal to r, r is greater than or equal to 0, st is r, end is equal to r + 1, stdin is empty. If the first and last elements of a are equal, then ans is equal to r - l - 1. If the first and last elements of a are not equal, then if st is 0 and end is 0, ans is n-1; otherwise, ans is 0. The maximum of 0 and ans is being printed.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the output state after the loop executes 3 times. This is because the loop will continue to execute until the condition `l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]` is no longer true, at which point `l` will be equal to `r`. The values of `st` and `end` will also be updated accordingly. The output state will remain the same as the output state after the loop executes 3 times, with the maximum of 0 and `ans` being printed.
