To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions that affect the value of `ans`.

1. **n**: An integer greater than 1.
2. **a**: A list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, with the first `k` elements being equal.
3. **l**, **r**, **st**, and **end** are all equal to `k`, and **end** is also equal to `r - k + 1`. This implies that `k` equals `r - k + 1`, suggesting a specific relationship between these variables, but the exact values aren't specified.
4. **stdin** is empty, which doesn't directly affect the calculation of `ans`.

The value of `ans` is determined by the following conditions:

- If the first and last elements of `a` are equal, then `ans` is `-1`.
- If the first and last elements of `a` are not equal:
  - If `st` is 0 and `end` is 0, then `ans` is `n - 1`.
  - Otherwise, `ans` is `0`.

Given that `st` and `end` are equal to `k`, and considering the conditions for `ans`, we have two main scenarios:

1. **First and last elements of `a` are equal**: `ans` is `-1`. However, the `print` statement outputs `max(0, ans)`, so in this case, the output would be `0` because `max(0, -1)` is `0`.

2. **First and last elements of `a` are not equal**:
   - If `k` (and thus `st` and `end`) is `0`, then `ans` is `n - 1`. The `print` statement would output `n - 1` because `max(0, n - 1)` is `n - 1`.
   - If `k` (and thus `st` and `end`) is not `0`, then `ans` is `0`. The `print` statement would output `0` because `max(0, 0)` is `0`.

However, since `k` cannot be `0` given that the first `k` elements of `a` are equal and `n` is greater than `1`, the scenario where `k` is `0` is not applicable.

Therefore, the possible outputs are:

- If the first and last elements of `a` are equal, the output is `0`.
- If the first and last elements of `a` are not equal, and considering `k` cannot be `0`, the output is also `0`.

Output: **0**
