Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers where a[0] == a[1] == ... == a[l], l is equal to r, r is greater than or equal to 0, stdin is empty, and the first element of a is not equal to the last element of a. If st is 0, end is 0, and the first element of a is not equal to the last element of a, then ans is n-1. Otherwise, ans is 0, and either st is not equal to 0, or end is not equal to 0, or the first element of a is equal to the last element of a.***
