Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers between 1 and n with the first k elements being equal, l is k, r is equal to k, stdin is empty, and the first element of a is not equal to the last element of a. If st is 0, end is 0, and the first element of a is not equal to the last element of a, then ans is n - 1. Otherwise, either st is not equal to 0 or end is not equal to 0 or the first element of a is equal to the last element of a, and ans is 0.***
