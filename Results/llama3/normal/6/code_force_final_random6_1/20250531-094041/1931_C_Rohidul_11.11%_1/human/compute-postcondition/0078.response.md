Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers where a[0] == a[1] == ... == a[l], l is equal to r, r is greater than or equal to 0, st is r, end is equal to r + 1, stdin is empty. If the first and last elements of a are equal, then ans is equal to r - l - 1. If the first and last elements of a are not equal, then if st is 0 and end is 0, ans is n-1; otherwise, ans is 0.***
