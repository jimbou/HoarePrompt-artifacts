Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers where a[0] == a[1] == ... == a[r], l is less than r, r is n - 2, st is r + 1, end is 1, stdin is empty**

The code modifies the values of `r` and `end`. The first line decrements `r` by 1, making it `n - 2`. The second line increments `end` by 1, making it 1. The value of `st` is not directly modified but is affected by the change in `r`, so it becomes `r + 1`, which is `n - 1`. The values of `n`, `a`, and `l` remain unchanged.
