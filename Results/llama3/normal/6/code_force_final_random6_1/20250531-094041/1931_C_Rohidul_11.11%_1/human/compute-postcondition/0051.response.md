Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers between 1 and n with the first k elements being equal, l is k, r is equal to k, st is k, end is equal to r - k + 1, stdin is empty. If the first and last elements of a are equal, then ans is -1. If the first and last elements of a are not equal, then if st is 0 and end is 0, ans is n - 1, otherwise ans is 0.***
