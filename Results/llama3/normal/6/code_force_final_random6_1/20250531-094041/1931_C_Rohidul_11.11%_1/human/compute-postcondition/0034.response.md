Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers between 1 and n with the first three elements being equal, l is 3, r is greater than 2, st is 3, end is 0, stdin is empty**

The code snippet consists of two lines that increment the values of `l` and `st` by 1. The initial state provides the values of `n`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `st`, `end`, and `stdin`. After executing the code, the values of `l` and `st` are updated.

The first line increments `l` by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The second line increments `st` by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The other variables remain unchanged.

The final state includes the updated values of `l` and `st`, along with the unchanged values of `n`, `a`, `r`, `end`, and `stdin`.
