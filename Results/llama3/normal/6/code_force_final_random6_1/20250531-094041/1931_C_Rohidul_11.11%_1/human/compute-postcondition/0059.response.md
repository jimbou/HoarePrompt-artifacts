Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers where a[0] == a[1] and a[1] == a[2], l is 2, r is greater than 2, st is 2, end is 0, stdin is empty**

In this final state, the values of `n`, `a`, `r`, `end`, and `stdin` remain unchanged as they were not modified by the code. The value of `l` is incremented by 1, making it 2, and the value of `st` is also incremented by 1, making it 2.
