Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4), then for each test case, first an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    st, end = 0, 0
    while l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]:
        l += 1
        st += 1
    while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
        r -= 1
        end += 1
    if a[0] == a[-1]:
        ans = r - l - 1
    elif st == 0 and end == 0 and a[0] != a[-1]:
        ans = len(a) - 1
    else:
        ans = r - l
    print(max(0, ans))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers between 1 and n starting with at least k identical integers, l is k-1, r is greater than or equal to k-1, st is k-1, end is the number of times the loop executes, stdin is empty. If the first and last elements of a are equal, then ans is r - (k-1) - 1 which is greater than or equal to 0. If the first and last elements of a are not equal, then if st is 0, end is 0, and ans is n-1. Otherwise, ans is greater than or equal to 0, and the maximum value between 0 and ans is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers between 1 and n with the first k elements being equal, l is k, r is equal to k, st is k, end is equal to r - k + 1, stdin is empty. If the first and last elements of a are equal, then ans is -1. If the first and last elements of a are not equal, then if st is 0 and end is 0, ans is n - 1, otherwise ans is 0. The maximum of 0 and ans is printed, which is either 0 or n - 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers where a[0] == a[1] == ... == a[l], l is equal to r, r is greater than or equal to 0, st is r, end is equal to r + 1, stdin is empty. If the first and last elements of a are equal, then ans is equal to r - l - 1. If the first and last elements of a are not equal, then if st is 0 and end is 0, ans is n-1; otherwise, ans is 0. The maximum of 0 and ans is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
