Postcondition: **T is greater than 2, i is 2, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains T-4 lines of input, each containing two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9). If a is even and b is odd, 'Alice' is printed. If a is not even or b is not odd, then if a > b, 'Bob' is printed, otherwise 'Alice' is printed.**
