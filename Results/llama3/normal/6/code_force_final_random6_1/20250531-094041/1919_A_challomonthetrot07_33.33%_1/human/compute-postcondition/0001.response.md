According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T` and `i`. If `T` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `T` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `T` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0. 
State: **`T` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains T lines of input, each containing two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9)**
