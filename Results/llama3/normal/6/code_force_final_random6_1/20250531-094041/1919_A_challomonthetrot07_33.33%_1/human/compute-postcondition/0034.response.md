Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains T-1 lines of input, each containing two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9). If `a` equals `b`, 'Bob' is printed. If `a` is not equal to `b`, then if `a` is 1, 'Alice' is printed. If `a` is not 1, then if `b` is 1, 'Bob' is printed. If `a` is not 1 and `b` is not 1, then if `a` is odd, 'Bob' is printed. If `a` is even, then if `b` is odd, 'Alice' is printed. If `a` is even and `b` is even, or if `a` is odd, then if `a` is greater than `b`, 'Bob' is printed, otherwise 'Alice' is printed.***
