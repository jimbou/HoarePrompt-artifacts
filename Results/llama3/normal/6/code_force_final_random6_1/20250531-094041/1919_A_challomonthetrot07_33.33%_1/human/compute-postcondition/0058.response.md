Output State: **`T` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains T-4 lines of input, each containing two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9)**

In this output state, the values of `T` and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `b` are updated to the new integers read from the input, which are between 1 and 10^9. The stdin now contains T-4 lines of input, each containing two integers a and b, since one line of input has been consumed by the `input()` function.
