Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine the winner of the game in all cases. 

For example, when a = 4 and b = 5, the program prints 'Alice', but the correct answer is 'Bob'. 

The correct solution should be based on the fact that the player who has the opportunity to make the last move wins the game. This happens when the total number of coins is odd. 

So, the correct program should print 'Alice' if (a + b) % 2 == 1, and 'Bob' otherwise. 

Here is the correct code:

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b) % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')
