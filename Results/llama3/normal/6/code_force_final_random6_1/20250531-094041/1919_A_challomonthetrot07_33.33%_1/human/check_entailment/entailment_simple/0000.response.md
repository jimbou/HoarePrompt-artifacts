Reasoning: 

The given program is incorrect. The logic used in the program is not correct. The correct logic is that if the total number of coins (a + b) is odd, then Alice will win, otherwise Bob will win. The program does not follow this logic.

For example, in the case where a = 5 and b = 3, the program will print 'Bob' because a % 2 == 1, but the correct answer is 'Bob' because (a + b) % 2 == 0.

Correctness: **False**
