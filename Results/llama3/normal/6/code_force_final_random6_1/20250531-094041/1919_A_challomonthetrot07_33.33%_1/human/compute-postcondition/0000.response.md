Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains T lines of input, each containing two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9)**

In this output state, the variable `T` has been assigned the value of the first line of input, which is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). The stdin still contains multiple lines of input, but the first line has been consumed. The remaining T lines of input each contain two integers a and b, where a and b are between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive).
