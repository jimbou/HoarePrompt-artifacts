Output State: **`T` is 0, `i` is `T`, `a` and `b` are undefined, stdin is empty. No more output is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that the loop has finished executing all its iterations, and the variables `a` and `b` are no longer defined because there is no more input to read from stdin. The loop counter `i` has reached the value of `T`, which means that the loop has executed `T` times. No more output is printed because the loop has finished executing.
