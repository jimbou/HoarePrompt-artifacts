To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `T`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `T`. If `i` is less than `T`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `T` is greater than 1.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Since `T` is greater than 1, it must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`T` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains T-3 lines of input, each containing two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9)**
