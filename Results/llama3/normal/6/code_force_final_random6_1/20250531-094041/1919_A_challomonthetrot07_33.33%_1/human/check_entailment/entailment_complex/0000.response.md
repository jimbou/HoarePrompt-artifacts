Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly determines the winner of the game based on the values of `a` and `b`. The program uses a series of if-elif statements to cover all possible cases and determine the winner.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:

- If `a` and `b` are equal, Bob wins because Alice will be forced to make the first move and will eventually run out of coins.
- If `a` is 1, Alice wins because she can swap wallets with Bob and then remove a coin from Bob's wallet, forcing Bob to make a move that will eventually lead to him running out of coins.
- If `b` is 1, Bob wins because Alice will be forced to make the first move and will eventually run out of coins.
- If `a` is odd, Bob wins because Alice will be forced to make the first move and will eventually run out of coins.
- If `a` is even and `b` is odd, Alice wins because she can swap wallets with Bob and then remove a coin from Bob's wallet, forcing Bob to make a move that will eventually lead to him running out of coins.
- If `a` is greater than `b`, Bob wins because Alice will be forced to make the first move and will eventually run out of coins.
- In all other cases, Alice wins because she can make a move that will force Bob to run out of coins.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the winner's name accordingly.

Correctness: **True**
