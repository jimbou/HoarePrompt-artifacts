To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `T`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `T`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `T` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. Since `T` is greater than 0, it must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`T` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains T-2 lines of input, each containing two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9)**
