Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains T-1 lines of input, each containing two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9), a is not equal to b, a is not equal to 1, and b is not equal to 1, and a is even. If a is even and b is odd, 'Alice' is printed. If a is even and b is even, or if a is odd, then if a is greater than b, 'Bob' is printed, otherwise 'Alice' is printed.***
