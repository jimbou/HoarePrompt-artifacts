Postcondition: ***T is greater than 1, i is 1, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains T-3 lines of input, each containing two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9). If b is 1, 'Bob' is printed. If b is not 1, then if a is odd, 'Bob' is printed. If a is even, either 'Alice' or 'Bob' is printed depending on whether a is greater than b or not, or 'Alice' is printed if b is odd.***
