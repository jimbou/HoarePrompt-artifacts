Postcondition: ***T is greater than 2, i is 2, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains T-4 lines of input, each containing two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9). If a equals b, 'Bob' is printed. If a is not equal to b, then if a is 1, 'Alice' is printed. If a is not 1, then if b is 1, 'Bob' is printed. If b is not 1, then if a is odd, 'Bob' is printed. If a is even, then if b is odd, 'Alice' is printed. Otherwise, if a > b, 'Bob' is printed, otherwise 'Alice' is printed.***
