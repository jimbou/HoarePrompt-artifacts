The code `word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'` appends the string 'a', the character at index `n - 28` in the string `alphabet`, and the string 'z' to the string `word`. The string `alphabet` contains all lowercase English letters, so `alphabet[n - 28]` is the character at index `n - 28` in the alphabet. Since `n` is an integer, `n - 28` is also an integer. The value of `i` is unknown but increased by 1, so it is still unknown but increased by 1. The stdin contains t-2 lines each containing an integer n, so it still contains t-2 lines each containing an integer n. The variable `word` is now a string that contains 'a', the character at index `n - 28` in the alphabet, and 'z'. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`alphabet` is a string of all lowercase English letters, `i` is unknown but increased by 1, `word` is a string that contains 'a', the character at index `n - 28` in the alphabet, and 'z', `n` is an integer, stdin contains t-2 lines each containing an integer n**
