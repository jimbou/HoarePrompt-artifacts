Output State: **alphabet is a string of all lowercase English letters, stdin is empty, i is equal to t, n is an integer equal to the last input, and word is a string that was printed in the last iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the string `alphabet` remains unchanged, the standard input `stdin` is empty because all the inputs have been read, the loop counter `i` is equal to the number of iterations `t`, the variable `n` is equal to the last input read, and the variable `word` is equal to the last string that was printed in the last iteration of the loop.
