Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `alphabet` is a string of all lowercase English letters, stdin contains two inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 100) and then t lines each containing an integer n (3 <= n <= 78).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    word = ''
    if n > 52:
        word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
    elif n > 27:
        word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
    elif n == 27:
        word = 'aay'
    else:
        word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
    print(word)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: alphabet is a string of all lowercase English letters, stdin contains t-2 lines each containing an integer n (3 <= n <= 78). If n > 52, word is a string containing a single lowercase letter followed by 'zz'. If n is less than or equal to 27, word is a string that contains 'aa' and the (n-2)th letter of the English alphabet, if n is 27, word is 'aay'. If n is greater than 27 but less than or equal to 52, word is a string that contains 'a' followed by the (n-28)th letter of the alphabet and then 'z', and the word is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: alphabet is a string of all lowercase English letters, stdin contains t-2 lines each containing an integer n, i is unknown but increased by 1, n is an integer. If n > 52, word is a string that contains the character at index `n - 53` in `alphabet` and 'zz'. If n is between 28 and 52, word is a string that contains 'a', the character at index `n - 28` in the alphabet, and 'z'. If n is 27, word is 'aay'. Otherwise, word is a string that contains 'aa' and the (n-2)th letter of the alphabet, and word is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: alphabet is a string of all lowercase English letters, stdin contains t-5 lines each containing an integer, i is unknown but increased by 1, n is an integer equal to the first input. If n > 52, word is a string containing the character at index n-53 in alphabet followed by 'zz'. If n is between 27 and 52, word is 'a' + the nth letter of the alphabet + 'z'. If n is 27, word is 'aay'. Otherwise, word is a string that starts with 'aa' followed by the (n-3)th letter of the alphabet, and the word is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
