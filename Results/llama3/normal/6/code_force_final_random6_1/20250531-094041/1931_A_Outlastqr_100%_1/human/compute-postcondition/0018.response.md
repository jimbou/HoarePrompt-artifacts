The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `stdin`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `stdin`. If `i` is less than the number of lines in `stdin`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is unknown, `stdin` contains t-2 lines each containing an integer n. So for the loop to be executed one more time `i` must be increased by 1 and `stdin` must contain t-1 lines each containing an integer n.
State: **alphabet is a string of all lowercase English letters, stdin contains t-1 lines each containing an integer n, i is unknown but increased by 1, word is unknown**
