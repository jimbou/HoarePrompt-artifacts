Output State: **`alphabet` is a string of all lowercase English letters, `n` is an integer and `n` is less than 27, `word` is a string that contains 'aa' and the (n-2)th letter of the English alphabet, stdin contains t-2 lines each containing an integer n (3 <= n <= 78)**

In this output state, the value of `word` has been updated to include 'aa' and the (n-2)th letter of the English alphabet, which is obtained by indexing into the `alphabet` string with `n - 3`. The values of `alphabet` and `n` remain unchanged. The stdin now contains t-2 lines of input, as one line has been processed.
