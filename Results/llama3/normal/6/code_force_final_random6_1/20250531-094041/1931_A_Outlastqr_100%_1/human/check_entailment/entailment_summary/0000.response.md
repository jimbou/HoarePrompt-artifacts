Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded from a given integer. The program handles different cases based on the value of the input integer `n` and constructs the corresponding three-letter word accordingly.

The program uses the `string.ascii_lowercase` constant to get the lowercase English letters and uses indexing to select the appropriate letters based on the value of `n`. The conditions and logic used to construct the word are correct and match the problem description.

The program also handles the edge case where `n` is exactly 27, which is not covered by the other conditions. In this case, the program sets the word to 'aay', which is the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that can be encoded from the integer 27.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
