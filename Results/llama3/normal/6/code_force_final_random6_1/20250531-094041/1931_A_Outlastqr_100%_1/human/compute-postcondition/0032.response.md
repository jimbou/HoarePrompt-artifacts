The code appends 'a' and the 28th letter after 'a' in the alphabet and 'z' to the word. The 28th letter after 'a' in the alphabet is the nth letter after 'a' since n is an integer equal to the first input which is between 1 and 26. The value of i is increased by 1 but it is still unknown. The stdin contains t-5 lines each containing an integer. The alphabet is still a string of all lowercase English letters. The values of the other variables are not affected.
Output State: **`alphabet` is a string of all lowercase English letters, `i` is unknown but increased by 1, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `word` is 'a' + the nth letter of the alphabet + 'z', stdin contains t-5 lines each containing an integer**
