To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of objects in the loop head. The loop head involves the variable `i` and the `input()` function. For the loop to execute, `input()` must provide a value that can be converted to an integer, and this integer must be greater than 0.

Given that `stdin` contains two inputs: first an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 100) and then `t` lines each containing an integer `n` (3 <= n <= 78), we need to adjust the state so that the first input is an integer greater than 0, as this will determine the number of iterations of the loop.

State: **`alphabet` is a string of all lowercase English letters, stdin contains an integer t that must be greater than 0, followed by t lines each containing an integer n (3 <= n <= 78)**
