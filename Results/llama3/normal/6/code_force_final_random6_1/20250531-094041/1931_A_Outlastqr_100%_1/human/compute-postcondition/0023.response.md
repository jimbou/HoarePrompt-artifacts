Output State: **`alphabet` is a string of all lowercase English letters, `i` is increased by 1, `word` is a string that contains 'aa' and the (n-2)th letter of the alphabet, `n` is an integer, stdin contains t-3 lines each containing an integer**.

In this output state, the value of `word` has been updated to include 'aa' and the (n-2)th letter of the alphabet, which is obtained by indexing into the `alphabet` string with `n-3` as the index. The value of `i` has been increased by 1, but its exact value is still unknown. The values of `alphabet` and `n` remain unchanged. The stdin now contains t-3 lines each containing an integer, since two lines have been consumed by the previous inputs.
