The code `word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'` appends a character from the `alphabet` string and the string `'zz'` to the `word` string. The character appended from `alphabet` is at index `n - 53`, where `n` is an integer greater than 52.

Since `n` is greater than 52, `n - 53` will be a positive integer. The `alphabet` string contains all lowercase English letters, so the character at index `n - 53` will be a lowercase letter.

The `word` string is initially empty, so after the execution of the code, it will contain a single lowercase letter followed by the string `'zz'`.

The values of the other variables are not affected by the code.

Output State: **`alphabet` is a string of all lowercase English letters, `n` is an integer greater than 52, `word` is a string containing a single lowercase letter followed by `'zz'`, stdin contains t-2 lines each containing an integer n (3 <= n <= 78)**
