Output State: **`alphabet` is a string of all lowercase English letters, `n` is an integer and `n` is less than or equal to 52, and the current value of `n` is greater than 27, `word` is a string that contains 'a' followed by the (n-28)th letter of the alphabet and then 'z', stdin contains t-2 lines each containing an integer n (3 <= n <= 78)**

In this output state, the value of `word` has been updated to include the character 'a', the (n-28)th letter of the alphabet (since `n` is greater than 27), and the character 'z'. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin now contains t-2 lines of input, as one line has been processed.
