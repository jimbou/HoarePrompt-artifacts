Output State: **alphabet is a string of all lowercase English letters, stdin contains t-1 lines each containing an integer n (3 <= n <= 78), n is an integer, word is an empty string**

In this output state, the value of `alphabet` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The stdin initially contains an integer t followed by t lines each containing an integer n. After the first line of the code is executed, the value of t is read from stdin and assigned to the variable n. As a result, stdin now contains t-1 lines each containing an integer n. The second line of the code initializes an empty string and assigns it to the variable word.
