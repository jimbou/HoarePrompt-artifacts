Output State: **`alphabet` is a string of all lowercase English letters, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `i` is unknown but increased by 1, `word` is 'aay', stdin contains t-5 lines each containing an integer**

In this output state, the value of `word` has been updated to 'aay'. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-5 lines of integers, as the code does not consume any input. The value of `i` is still unknown but has been increased by 1. The value of `n` is still equal to the first input. The `alphabet` variable remains a string of all lowercase English letters.
