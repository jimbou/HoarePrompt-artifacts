Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 1, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive), m is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive), count is strictly less than or equal to m, ans is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive) plus the sum of g / count + 1 for all iterations of the loop plus g / 3 + 1 plus g / count + 1, countmins is equal to count - 1, g is equal to n / count - countmins.**

In this output state, the values of t, i, n, and m remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of count is incremented by 1, and the value of ans is increased by g / count + 1. The value of g is decreased by countmins. The value of countmins remains equal to count - 1.
