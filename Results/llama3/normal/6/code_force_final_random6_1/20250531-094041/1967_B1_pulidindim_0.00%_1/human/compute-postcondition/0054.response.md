Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive) and must be at least 4, `count` is 3, `ans` is an integer equal to `n` + `n / 3` / 3 + 1, `countmins` is 2, `g` is an integer equal to `n / 3`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
