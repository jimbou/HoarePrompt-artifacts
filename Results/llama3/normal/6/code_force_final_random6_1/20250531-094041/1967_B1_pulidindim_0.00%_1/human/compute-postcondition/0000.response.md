Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two integers n, m (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6)**

In natural language, the output state is that the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first input from the standard input, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The standard input still contains multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m`, where `n` and `m` are both between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive).
