Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive), m is greater than or equal to 2, count is 2, ans is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive), countmins is 1, g is a floating-point number equal to n / 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `count`, and `ans` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The variable `countmins` is assigned the value of `count - 1`, which is 1. The variable `g` is assigned the value of `n / count`, which is `n / 2` since `count` is 2. The state of `stdin` also remains unchanged as the code does not interact with it.
