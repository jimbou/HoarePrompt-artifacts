Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive), `count` is less than or equal to `m`, `ans` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive) plus the sum of `g / count + 1` for all iterations of the loop plus `g / 3 + 1`, `countmins` is less than or equal to `count - 1`, `g` is less than `n / count` and is equal to `n / count`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
