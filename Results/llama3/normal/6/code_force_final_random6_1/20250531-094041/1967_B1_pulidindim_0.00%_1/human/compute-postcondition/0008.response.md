Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive), m is greater than or equal to 2, count is 3, ans is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive) plus the value of g / count + 1, countmins is 1, g is a floating-point number equal to n / 2 minus countmins.**

In this output state, the value of `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, and `countmins` remains unchanged. The value of `count` is incremented by 1, making it 3. The value of `ans` is updated by adding the value of `g / count + 1` to its original value. The value of `g` is updated by subtracting `countmins` from its original value.
