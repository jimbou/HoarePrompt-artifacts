Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 2, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive) and must be at least 2, count is 2, ans is an integer equal to n, countmins is 1, g is an integer equal to n / 2. If g is less than countmins, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the current values of t, i, n, m, count, ans, countmins, and g.***
