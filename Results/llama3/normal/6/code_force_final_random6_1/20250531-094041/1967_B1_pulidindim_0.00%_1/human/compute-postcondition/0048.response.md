Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive) and must be at least 2, `count` is 2, `ans` is an integer equal to `n`, `countmins` is 1, `g` is an integer equal to `n / 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. The variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `count`, `ans`, `countmins`, and `g` retain their initial values, and the loop or if statement is exited.
