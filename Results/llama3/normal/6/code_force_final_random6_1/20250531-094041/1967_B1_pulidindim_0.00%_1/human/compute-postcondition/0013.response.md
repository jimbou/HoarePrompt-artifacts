Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive), m is greater than or equal to 3, count is 4, ans is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive) plus the value of n / count + 1 plus g / count + 1, countmins is 2, g is less than countmins.**

In natural language, the output state can be described as follows:

The value of `t` remains unchanged, still an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The value of `i` also remains unchanged, still 0. The value of `n` remains unchanged, still an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive). The value of `m` remains unchanged, still greater than or equal to 3. The value of `count` has been incremented by 1, now equal to 4. The value of `ans` has been incremented by the value of `g / count + 1`, where `g` is the floating-point number equal to `n / count`. The value of `countmins` remains unchanged, still 2. The value of `g` has been decremented by `countmins`, now less than `countmins`.
