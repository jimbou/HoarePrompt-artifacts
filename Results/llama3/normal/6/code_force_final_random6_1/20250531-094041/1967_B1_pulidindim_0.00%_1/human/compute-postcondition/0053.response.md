Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive) and must be at least 4, `count` is 3, `ans` is an integer equal to `n` + `n / 3` / 3 + 1, `countmins` is 2, `g` is an integer equal to `n / 3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with all variables retaining their original values and ranges. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
