Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive), m is greater than or equal to 3, count is 3, ans is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive) plus the value of n / count + 1, countmins is 2, g is a floating-point number equal to n / count, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their initial values and ranges, as the `break` statement only exits the innermost loop or if statement without modifying any variables.
