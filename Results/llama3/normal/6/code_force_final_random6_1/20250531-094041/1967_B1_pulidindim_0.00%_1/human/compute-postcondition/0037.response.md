Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive), `count` is strictly less than or equal to `m`, `ans` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive) plus the sum of `g / count + 1` for all iterations of the loop plus `g / 3 + 1` plus `g / count + 1`, `countmins` is equal to `count - 1`, `g` is equal to `n / count`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `count`, `ans`, `countmins`, and `g` remain unchanged, and we have exited the loop or if statement we were directly inside.
