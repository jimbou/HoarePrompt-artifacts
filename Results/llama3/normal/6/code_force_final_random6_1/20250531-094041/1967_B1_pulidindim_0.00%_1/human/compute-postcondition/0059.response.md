Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive) and must be greater than 4, `count` is 4, `ans` is an integer equal to `n + n / 3 / 3 + 1 + g / count + 1`, `countmins` is 3, `g` is an integer equal to `n / 4`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
