The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive), `count` is equal to `m` + 1, `ans` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive) plus the sum of `g` / `count` + 1 for all iterations of the loop, `countmins` is equal to `m`, `g` is less than `countmins` and is equal to `n` / `m` - `countmins`, and the integer value of `ans` is being printed**
