Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 2, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive), count is 2, ans is an integer equal to n, countmins is not defined, g is not defined**

The code snippet consists of three lines. The first line assigns the integer values of the input to `n` and `m`. The second line assigns the value 2 to `count`. The third line assigns the value of `n` to `ans`. 

The initial state of `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `count`, `ans`, `countmins`, and `g` are not modified by the code snippet, except for `count` and `ans`. The value of `count` is updated to 2, and the value of `ans` is updated to the value of `n`. The values of `countmins` and `g` are not defined in the output state because they are not modified by the code snippet.
