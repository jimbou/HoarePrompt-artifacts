Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 2, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive) and must be greater than 4, count is 4, ans is an integer equal to n + n / 3 / 3 + 1 + g / count + 1, countmins is 3, g is an integer equal to n / 4.**

The code modifies the values of `countmins` and `g`. The first line decrements `countmins` by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The second line recalculates the value of `g` as `n / count`, where `count` is 4. This changes the value of `g` from `n / 3 - countmins` to `n / 4`. The other variables remain unchanged.
