Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two integers n, m (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6)
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    count = 2
    ans = n
    while count <= m:
        countmins = count - 1
        g = n / count
        if g < countmins:
            break
        g -= countmins
        ans += g / count + 1
        count += 1
    print(int(ans))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive), count is equal to m plus 1, ans is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive) plus the sum of g / count + 1 for all iterations of the loop, countmins is equal to m, g is less than countmins and is equal to n / m minus countmins, and the integer value of ans is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 1, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive), count is equal to m + 1, ans is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive) plus the sum of g / count + 1 for all iterations of the loop, countmins is equal to m, g is less than countmins and is equal to n / m - countmins, and the integer value of ans is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 2, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive), count is m + 1, ans is an integer equal to n + sum(g / count + 1) from count = 2 to m, countmins is m - 1, g is an integer equal to n / m - countmins, and the integer value of ans is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
