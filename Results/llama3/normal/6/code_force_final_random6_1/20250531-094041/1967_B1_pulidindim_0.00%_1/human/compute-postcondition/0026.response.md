Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 1, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive), m is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive), count is 2, ans is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive) plus the sum of g / count + 1 for all iterations of the loop, countmins is 1, g is less than 1 and is equal to n / 2. The current value of g is less than the current value of countmins.**
