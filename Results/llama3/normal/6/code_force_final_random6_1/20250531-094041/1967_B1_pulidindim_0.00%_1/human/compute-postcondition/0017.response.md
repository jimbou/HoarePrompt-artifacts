Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive), m is greater than or equal to 4, count is less than or equal to m, ans is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive) plus the value of n / count + 1 plus g / count + 1, countmins is 1, g is less than countmins and is equal to n / count. If g is less than countmins, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
