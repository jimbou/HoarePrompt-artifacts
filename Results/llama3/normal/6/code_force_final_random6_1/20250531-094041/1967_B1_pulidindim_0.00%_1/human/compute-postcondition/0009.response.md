The only variable in the loop head is variable count, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable count.  If count is less than or equal to m, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, count is 3, m is greater than or equal to 2, So for the loop to be executed one more time the count needed to have been less than or equal to m and count currently must be less than or equal to m.
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive), m is greater than or equal to 3, count is 3, ans is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive) plus the value of g / count + 1, countmins is 1, g is a floating-point number equal to n / 2 minus countmins**
