Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 2, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive) and must be at least 2, count is 3, ans is an integer equal to n + g / count + 1, countmins is 1, g is an integer equal to n / 2 - countmins.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, and `countmins` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `count` is incremented by 1, making it 3. The value of `ans` is updated by adding `g / count + 1` to its original value, which was equal to `n`. The value of `g` is decremented by `countmins`, which is 1.
