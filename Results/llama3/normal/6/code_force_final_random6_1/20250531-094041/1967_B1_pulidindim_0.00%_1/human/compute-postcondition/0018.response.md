Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive), m is greater than or equal to 4, count is less than or equal to m plus 1, ans is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive) plus the value of n / count + 1 plus g / count + 1 plus g / count + 1, countmins is 1, g is less than countmins and is equal to n / count minus countmins. If g is less than countmins, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the value of count has been incremented by 1, and the value of ans has been updated by adding g / count + 1. The value of g has been decremented by countmins. All other variables remain unchanged.
