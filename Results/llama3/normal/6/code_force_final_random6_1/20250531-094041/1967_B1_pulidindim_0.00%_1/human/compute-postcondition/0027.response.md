Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive), `count` is 2, `ans` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive) plus the sum of `g` / `count` + 1 for all iterations of the loop, `countmins` is 1, `g` is less than 1 and is equal to `n` / 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `count`, `ans`, `countmins`, and `g` remain unchanged, and we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
