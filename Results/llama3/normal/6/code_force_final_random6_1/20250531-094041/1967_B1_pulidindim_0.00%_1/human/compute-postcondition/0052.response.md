The first line assigns the value of `count - 1` to `countmins`. Since `count` is 3, `countmins` becomes 2. The second line assigns the value of `n / count` to `g`. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive) and `count` is 3, `g` becomes an integer equal to `n / 3`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 2, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive) and must be at least 4, count is 3, ans is an integer equal to n + g / count + 1, countmins is 2, g is an integer equal to n / 3**
