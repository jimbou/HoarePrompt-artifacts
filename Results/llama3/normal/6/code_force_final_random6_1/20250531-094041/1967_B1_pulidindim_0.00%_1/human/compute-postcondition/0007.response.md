Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive), m is greater than or equal to 2, count is 2, ans is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive), countmins is 1, g is a floating-point number equal to n / 2. If g is less than countmins, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution.***
