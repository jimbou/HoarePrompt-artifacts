Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive), m is greater than or equal to 3, count is 3, ans is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6 (inclusive) plus the value of n / count + 1, countmins is 2. If the floating-point number g (which is equal to n / count) is less than countmins, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the next statement.***
