Output State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 positive integers, each less than or equal to 500, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to 500, `ans` is a list of n integers, `i` is 1, `ans[2]` is equal to `arr[1]` + `ans[1]`, and the remaining elements of `ans` are unchanged, `arr[1]` must be greater than or equal to 2 * (`arr[0]` + 1).**

In this output state, the value of `ans[2]` has been updated to be the sum of `arr[1]` and `ans[1]`. The remaining elements of `ans` remain unchanged. The values of `arr`, `n`, and `i` are unchanged. The condition that `arr[1]` must be greater than or equal to 2 * (`arr[0]` + 1) is still valid.
