To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n - 2`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to 500.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `n` remains the same.

State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 positive integers, each less than or equal to 500, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to 500, `ans` is a list of n integers. If `ans[i + 1]` is less than `arr[i + 1]`, then `ans[0]` is equal to `arr[0]` + 1, `ans[1]` is equal to 2 * (`arr[0]` + 1), `ans[2]` is equal to 3 * (`arr[0]` + 1), and the remaining elements of `ans` are 0, `i` is 1, and `arr[1]` must be greater than or equal to 2 * (`arr[0]` + 1). Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
