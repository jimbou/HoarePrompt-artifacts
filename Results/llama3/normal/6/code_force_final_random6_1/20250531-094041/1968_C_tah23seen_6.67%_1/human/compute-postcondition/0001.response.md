To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n-2` is at least 1, meaning `n` must be at least 3.

State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 positive integers, each less than or equal to 500, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to 500, `ans` is a list of n integers, where `ans[0]` is equal to `arr[0]` + 1, and the remaining elements of `ans` are 0, `i` is 0**
