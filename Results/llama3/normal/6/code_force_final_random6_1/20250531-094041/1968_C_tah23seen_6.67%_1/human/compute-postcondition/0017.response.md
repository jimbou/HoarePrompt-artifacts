Output State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 positive integers, each less than or equal to 500, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to 500, `ans` is a list of n integers, `i` is 1, `ans[2]` is equal to `arr[1]` + `ans[1]`, `ans[3]` is equal to `ans[2]` + `ans[2]`, `ans[4]` is equal to `ans[3]` + `ans[3]`, and the remaining elements of `ans` are unchanged, `arr[1]` must be greater than or equal to 2 * (`arr[0]` + 1), and `arr[2]` must be greater than or equal to `arr[1]` + `ans[1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans[4]` has been updated to be equal to `ans[3]` + `ans[3]`, which is a result of the code `ans[i + 1] += ans[i]` being executed. The other variables remain unchanged.
