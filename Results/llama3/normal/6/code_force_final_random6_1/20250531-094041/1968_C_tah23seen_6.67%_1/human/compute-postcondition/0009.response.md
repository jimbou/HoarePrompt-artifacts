Output State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 positive integers, each less than or equal to 500, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to 500, `ans` is a list of n integers, where `ans[0]` is equal to `arr[0]` + 1, `ans[1]` is equal to 2 * (`arr[0]` + 1), `ans[2]` is equal to 3 * (`arr[0]` + 1), and the remaining elements of `ans` are 0, `i` is 0, and `arr[1]` must be greater than or equal to 2 * (`arr[0]` + 1)**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `arr` remains unchanged, containing n-1 positive integers, each less than or equal to 500. The value of `n` also remains the same, being an integer between 3 and 500 (inclusive). The list `ans` has been updated, where the first element `ans[0]` is still equal to `arr[0]` + 1, the second element `ans[1]` is still equal to 2 * (`arr[0]` + 1), and the third element `ans[2]` is now equal to 3 * (`arr[0]` + 1). The remaining elements of `ans` are still 0. The value of `i` remains 0. Additionally, the condition that `arr[1]` must be greater than or equal to 2 * (`arr[0]` + 1) still holds.
