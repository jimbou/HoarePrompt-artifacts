The code updates the value of `ans[i + 1]` based on the values of `arr[i]` and `ans[i]`. Since `i` is 0, `ans[1]` is updated.

`ans[1]` is assigned the value of `arr[0]` + `ans[0]`. Since `ans[0]` is equal to `arr[0]` + 1, we can substitute this value into the expression. Therefore, `ans[1]` is assigned the value of `arr[0]` + (`arr[0]` + 1), which simplifies to 2 * `arr[0]` + 1.

The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 positive integers, each less than or equal to 500, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to 500, `ans` is a list of n integers, where `ans[0]` is equal to `arr[0]` + 1, `ans[1]` is equal to 2 * `arr[0]` + 1, and the remaining elements of `ans` are 0, `i` is 0**
