Output State: **ans is a list of n integers, where ans[1] remains unchanged, ans[2] is equal to arr[1] + ans[1], and for all i from 3 to n, ans[i] is equal to 2^(i-2) * (arr[1] + ans[1]).**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `ans` will have its first element unchanged, its second element equal to the sum of the first element of `arr` and the first element of `ans`, and all subsequent elements will be equal to 2 raised to the power of the index minus 2, multiplied by the sum of the first element of `arr` and the first element of `ans`.
