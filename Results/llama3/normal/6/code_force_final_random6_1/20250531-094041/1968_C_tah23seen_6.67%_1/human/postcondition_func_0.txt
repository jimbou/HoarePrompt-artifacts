The function generates a list of 'n' integers based on the input list 'arr' of 'n-1' positive integers. It sets the first element of the output list to the first element of 'arr' plus 1, and the last element to the last element of 'arr' plus the second last element of the output list. The remaining elements are set to 0. The function ensures that each element in the output list is less than or equal to 501. The output list has a length of 'n', which is between 2 and 500 (inclusive).
