Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of n-1 positive integers, each less than or equal to 500, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to 500, `ans` is a list of n integers, where `ans[0]` is equal to `arr[0]` + 1, `ans[1]` is equal to 2 * `arr[0]` + 1, and the remaining elements of `ans` are 0, `i` is 0, and the current value of `ans[i + 1]` is less than the current value of `arr[i + 1]`.**
