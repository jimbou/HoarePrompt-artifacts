Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of n-1 positive integers, each less than or equal to 500, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to 500, `ans` is a list of n integers, `i` is 1, `ans[2]` is equal to `arr[1]` + `ans[1]`, and the remaining elements of `ans` are unchanged, `arr[1]` must be greater than or equal to 2 * (`arr[0]` + 1). If `ans[i + 1]` is less than `arr[i + 1]`, then for all i from 3 to n, `ans[i]` is equal to 2^(i-2) * (arr[1] + ans[1]). Otherwise, no changes are made to `ans`.**
