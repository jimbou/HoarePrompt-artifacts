Output State: **The program returns a list of n integers, where the first element is equal to the first element of the input list 'arr' plus 1, the last element is equal to the last element of the input list 'arr' plus the second last element of the output list, and the remaining elements are 0. The length of the output list is equal to 'n', which is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 500. Each element in the output list is less than or equal to 500 + 1 = 501, since each element in the input list 'arr' is less than or equal to 500.**
