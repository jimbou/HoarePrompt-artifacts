According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `ans` and `arr`. If `ans[i + 1]` is less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `ans[2]` is equal to `arr[1]` + `ans[1]`, `ans[3]` is equal to `arr[2]` + `ans[2]`, `ans[4]` is equal to `ans[3]` + `ans[3]`, and the remaining elements of `ans` are unchanged, `arr[1]` must be greater than or equal to 2 * (`arr[0]` + 1). So for the loop to be executed one more time `ans[3]` must be less than or equal to `arr[3]`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 positive integers, each less than or equal to 500, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4 and less than or equal to 500, `ans` is a list of n integers, `i` is 2, `ans[2]` is equal to `arr[1]` + `ans[1]`, `ans[3]` is equal to `arr[2]` + `ans[2]`, `ans[4]` is equal to `ans[3]` + `ans[3]`, and the remaining elements of `ans` are unchanged, `arr[1]` must be greater than or equal to 2 * (`arr[0]` + 1), and `ans[3]` must be less than or equal to `arr[3]`**
