Output State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 positive integers, each less than or equal to 500, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to 500, `ans` is a list of n integers, `i` is 1, `ans[2]` is equal to `arr[1]` + `ans[1]`, `ans[3]` is equal to `ans[2]` + `ans[2]`, and the remaining elements of `ans` are unchanged, `arr[1]` must be greater than or equal to 2 * (`arr[0]` + 1), and `arr[2]` must be sufficiently large to accommodate the condition.**

In this output state, the value of `ans[3]` has been updated to be the sum of `ans[2]` and `ans[2]`, which is equivalent to twice the value of `ans[2]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that `arr[1]` must be greater than or equal to 2 * (`arr[0]` + 1) and `arr[2]` must be sufficiently large to accommodate the condition still holds.
