Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find an array a_1, a_2, ..., a_n that satisfies the given conditions. The program initializes the first element of the output array as the first element of the input array plus 1, and the last element as the last element of the input array plus the second last element of the output array. It then iterates over the remaining elements of the input array, setting each element of the output array to the sum of the current element of the input array and the previous element of the output array. If the current element of the output array is less than or equal to the current element of the input array, it adds the previous element of the output array to the current element until it is greater than the current element of the input array. This ensures that each element of the output array is greater than the corresponding element of the input array, as required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
