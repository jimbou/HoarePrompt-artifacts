Output State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 positive integers, each less than or equal to 500, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to 500, `ans` is a list of n integers, where `ans[0]` is equal to `arr[0]` + 1, `ans[1]` is equal to 3 * `arr[0]` + 1, and the remaining elements of `ans` are 0, `i` is 0, and `arr[1]` must be greater than or equal to 2 * `arr[0]` + 1**

In this output state, the value of `ans[1]` has been updated to `3 * arr[0] + 1` because `ans[i + 1]` (which is `ans[1]`) is incremented by `ans[i]` (which is `arr[0] + 1`). The other variables remain unchanged.
