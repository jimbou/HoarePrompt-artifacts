Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input and initializes the variables as described in the problem statement.
2.  The function `func_1` generates a list of `n` integers based on the input list `arr` of `n-1` positive integers.
3.  The function sets the first element of the output list to the first element of `arr` plus 1, which satisfies the condition `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9` for all `1 ≤ i ≤ n`.
4.  The function sets the last element of the output list to the last element of `arr` plus the second last element of the output list, which ensures that `x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}` for all `2 ≤ i ≤ n`.
5.  The function ensures that each element in the output list is less than or equal to 501, which is within the allowed range of `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`.
6.  The program correctly prints the output list for each test case.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments.

Correctness: **True**
