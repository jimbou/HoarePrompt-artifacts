Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of n-1 positive integers, each less than or equal to 500, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4 and less than or equal to 500, `ans` is a list of n integers, `i` is 2, `ans[2]` is equal to `arr[1]` + `ans[1]`, `ans[3]` is equal to `arr[2]` + `ans[2]`, and the remaining elements of `ans` are unchanged, `arr[1]` must be greater than or equal to 2 * (`arr[0]` + 1). If `ans[i + 1]` is less than `arr[i + 1]`, then `ans` is updated such that `ans[4]` is equal to `ans[3]` + `ans[3]`, `ans[5]` is equal to `ans[4]` + `ans[4]`, `ans[6]` is equal to `ans[5]` + `ans[5]`, and so on until `ans[n-1]` is equal to `ans[n-2]` + `ans[n-2]`, and the remaining elements of `ans` are unchanged, `arr[1]` must be greater than or equal to 2 * (`arr[0]` + 1), `ans[3]` must be less than or equal to `arr[3]`, and `arr[2]` + `ans[2]` must be less than or equal to `arr[3]`.***
