Output State: **arr is a list of n-1 positive integers, each less than or equal to 500, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 500, ans is a list of n integers, where ans[0] is equal to arr[0] + 1, and the remaining elements of ans are 0.**

In this output state, the initial values of `arr` and `n` remain unchanged. The code creates a new list `ans` of length `n`, where the first element `ans[0]` is assigned the value of `arr[0] + 1`. The remaining elements of `ans` are initialized to 0.
