Output State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 positive integers, each less than or equal to 500, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4 and less than or equal to 500, `ans` is a list of n integers, `i` is 2, `ans[2]` is equal to `arr[1]` + `ans[1]`, `ans[3]` is equal to `arr[2]` + `ans[2]`, `ans[4]` is equal to `ans[3]` + `ans[3]`, and the remaining elements of `ans` are unchanged, `arr[1]` must be greater than or equal to 2 * (`arr[0]` + 1)**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `arr` remains unchanged with n-1 positive integers, each less than or equal to 500. The value of `n` also remains the same, within the range of 4 to 500. The list `ans` has been updated such that the value at index 4 is now the sum of the values at indices 3 and 3. The values of `i`, `ans[2]`, `ans[3]`, and the remaining elements of `ans` remain unchanged. The condition that `arr[1]` is greater than or equal to 2 times (`arr[0]` + 1) still holds.
