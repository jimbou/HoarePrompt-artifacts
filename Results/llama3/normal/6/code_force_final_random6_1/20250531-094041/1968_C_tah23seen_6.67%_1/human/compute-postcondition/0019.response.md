Output State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 positive integers, each less than or equal to 500, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to 500, `ans` is a list of n integers, `i` is 1, `ans[2]` is equal to `arr[1]` + `ans[1]`, `ans[3]` is equal to `ans[2]` + `ans[2]`, `ans[4]` is equal to `ans[3]` + `ans[3]`, `ans[5]` is equal to `ans[4]` + `ans[4]`, and the remaining elements of `ans` are unchanged, `arr[1]` must be greater than or equal to 2 * (`arr[0]` + 1), `arr[2]` must be greater than or equal to `arr[1]` + `ans[1]`, and `ans[1]` must be less than or equal to `arr[2]` - `arr[1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `arr` remains unchanged with n-1 positive integers, each less than or equal to 500. The value of `n` also remains the same, within the range of 3 to 500. The list `ans` has been updated such that `ans[5]` is now equal to `ans[4]` + `ans[4]`, in addition to the previous conditions. The value of `i` is still 1. The conditions on `arr[1]`, `arr[2]`, and `ans[1]` are still valid.
