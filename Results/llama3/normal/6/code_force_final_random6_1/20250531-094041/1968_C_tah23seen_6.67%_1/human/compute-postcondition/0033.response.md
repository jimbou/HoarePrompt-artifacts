Output State: **arr is a list of n-1 positive integers, each less than or equal to 500, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 500, ans is a list of n integers, where ans[0] is equal to arr[0] + 1, ans[-1] is equal to arr[-1] + ans[-2], and the remaining elements of ans are 0.**

In this output state, the value of ans[-1] has been updated to be the sum of arr[-1] and ans[-2]. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
