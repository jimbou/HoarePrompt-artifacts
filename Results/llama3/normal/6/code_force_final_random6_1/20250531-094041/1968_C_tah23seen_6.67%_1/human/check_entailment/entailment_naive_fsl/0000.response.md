Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input is:

5
4
2 4 1

The program will output:

3 5 4 9

However, this output does not satisfy the condition x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1} for all 2 <= i <= n. Specifically, 4 mod 5 is not equal to 1.

The issue with the program is that it does not correctly calculate the values of a_i. The line `ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]` is not sufficient to ensure that x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}. A correct solution would need to take into account the modular arithmetic and ensure that the values of a_i are chosen such that the condition is satisfied.

For example, a correct solution could be:

def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [0] * n
    ans[0] = arr[0] + 1
    for i in range(n - 2):
        ans[i + 1] = (arr[i] + ans[i]) * 2
    ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]
    return ans

This solution ensures that x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1} by choosing the values of a_i such that they are multiples of the previous value, plus the current value of x_i. This ensures that the modular arithmetic condition is satisfied.
