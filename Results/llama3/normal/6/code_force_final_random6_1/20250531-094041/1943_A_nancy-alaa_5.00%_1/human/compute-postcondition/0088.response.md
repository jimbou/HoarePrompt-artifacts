Output: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `_` is 2, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 0, `first` is True. The current value of `i` is a key in `mpp` and the frequency of `i` in `arr` is 1. The program has not broken out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the value of `i` which is 0 is being printed**
