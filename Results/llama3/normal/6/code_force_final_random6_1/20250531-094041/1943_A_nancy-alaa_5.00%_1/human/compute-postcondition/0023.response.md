Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `_` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `n`, `i`, `arr`, `mpp`, and `_` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The initial state's conditions, such as `n` being greater than 1 and `i` being 1, are still valid. The dictionary `mpp` still contains the frequency of each integer in `arr`, and the variable `_` remains 0.
