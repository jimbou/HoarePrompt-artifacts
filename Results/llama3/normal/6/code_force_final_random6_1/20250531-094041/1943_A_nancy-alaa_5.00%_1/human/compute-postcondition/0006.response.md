Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `first` is False, `_` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `n`, `i`, `arr`, `mpp`, `first`, and `_` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The stdin still contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a list of integers. The current value of `i` is still not a key in the dictionary `mpp`, and the value of `i` which is 0 is still being printed.
