Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the optimal strategy for Alice to maximize the score and for Bob to minimize the score in the game.

The program first counts the frequency of each integer in the array using a Counter. Then, it iterates over the range [0, n-1] and checks if the current integer is not present in the array or if it appears only once. If it finds such an integer, it prints it and breaks the loop.

The program correctly handles the case where there are multiple integers that appear only once in the array. In this case, Alice should choose the smallest such integer to maximize the score, and the program correctly does this by iterating over the range [0, n-1] in ascending order.

The program also correctly handles the case where there are no integers that appear only once in the array. In this case, the smallest missing integer in the range [0, n-1] is the optimal choice for Alice, and the program correctly finds and prints this integer.

Overall, the program correctly implements the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob, and it correctly handles all possible cases.

Correctness: **True**
