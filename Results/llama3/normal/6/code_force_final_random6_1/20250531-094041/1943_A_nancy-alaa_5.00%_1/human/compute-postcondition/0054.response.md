Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer equal to the input integer, `arr` is a list of integers equal to the input list, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty. If `i` is not a key in the dictionary `mpp`, the value of `i` has been printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is a key in the dictionary `mpp` and `first` is True and `mpp[i]` is 1, then `first` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken. The current value of `mpp[i]` is either 1 or not 1.***
