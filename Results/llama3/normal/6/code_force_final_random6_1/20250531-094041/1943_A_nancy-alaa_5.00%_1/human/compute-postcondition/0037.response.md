Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `_` is 0. If `i` is a key in `mpp` and `mpp[i]` is 1 and `first` is True, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
