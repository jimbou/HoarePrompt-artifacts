The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `_` is 0. If `i` is a key in `mpp` and the frequency of `i` in `mpp` is 1, then `first` is set to True. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
