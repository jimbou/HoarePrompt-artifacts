Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `_` is 0, `first` is True. If `i` is not a key in `mpp`, then the value of `i` which is 1 is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is a key in `mpp` and the frequency of `i` in `mpp` is 1 and `first` is True, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.**

In this output state, the code has introduced a new variable `first` and assigned it the value `True`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The code does not modify the values of `n`, `i`, `arr`, `mpp`, or `_`. The conditions related to `i` being a key in `mpp` and the frequency of `i` in `mpp` also remain the same.
