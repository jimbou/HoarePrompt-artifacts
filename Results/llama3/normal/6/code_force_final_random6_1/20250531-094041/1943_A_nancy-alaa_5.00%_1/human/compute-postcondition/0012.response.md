Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `_` is 0. If `i` is not a key in `mpp` or `first` is False, no changes are made. If `i` is a key in `mpp` and `first` is True and the frequency of `i` in `mpp` is 1, then `first` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
