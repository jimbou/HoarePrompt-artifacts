Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `_` is 2, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 0. If `i` is a key in `mpp` and `first` is True and the frequency of `i` in `arr` is 1, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement and `first` is set to True. Otherwise, no changes occur. The current value of `mpp[i]` is 1***
