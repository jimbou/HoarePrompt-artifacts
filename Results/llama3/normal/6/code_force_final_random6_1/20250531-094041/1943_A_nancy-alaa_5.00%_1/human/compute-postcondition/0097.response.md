Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `_` is 2, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code `break` causes the program to exit the innermost loop or if statement it is directly inside. The values of the variables `n`, `arr`, `mpp`, `_`, `stdin`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only change is that the program breaks out of the loop or if statement, which is reflected in the output state.
