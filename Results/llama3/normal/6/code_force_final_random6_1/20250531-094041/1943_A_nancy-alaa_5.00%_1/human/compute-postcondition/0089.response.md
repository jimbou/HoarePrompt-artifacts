Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `_` is 2, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 0, `first` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `arr`, `mpp`, `_`, `stdin`, `i`, and `first` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
