Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers.
2. It uses a `Counter` object to count the frequency of each integer in the list.
3. The program then iterates over the range of `n` and checks if each integer `i` is present in the `Counter` object. If `i` is not present, it means that `i` is the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array, so it prints `i` and breaks the loop.
4. If `i` is present in the `Counter` object, the program checks if its frequency is 1 and if `first` is `True`. If both conditions are true, it means that `i` is the smallest non-negative integer that occurs only once in the array, and Alice can pick it to maximize the score. So, it prints `i` and breaks the loop.
5. If `i` is present in the `Counter` object and its frequency is 1, but `first` is `False`, it means that `i` is the smallest non-negative integer that occurs only once in the array, but Alice has not picked it yet. So, it sets `first` to `True`.
6. If the loop completes without finding a suitable `i`, it means that all integers from 0 to `n-1` are present in the array, and the MEX is `n`.

The program correctly implements the optimal strategy for Alice to maximize the score, which is to pick the smallest non-negative integer that occurs only once in the array, or the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array if no such integer occurs only once.

Correctness: **True**
