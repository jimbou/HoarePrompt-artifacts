Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `_` is 2, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 0, `first` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their initial values because the break statement only terminates the loop or if statement it is directly inside, without changing any variable values.
