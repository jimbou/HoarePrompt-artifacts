Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer (n) and a space-separated list of integers (arr). It then finds the first integer that appears only once in the array, or the smallest missing integer in the range [0, n-1] if no such integer exists, and prints it. The function processes all test cases and leaves the input stream empty.**
