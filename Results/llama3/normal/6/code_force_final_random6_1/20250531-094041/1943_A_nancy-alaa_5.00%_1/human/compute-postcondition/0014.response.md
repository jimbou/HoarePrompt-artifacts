Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `_` is 0, `first` is True. The current value of `i` is a key in `mpp` and the frequency of `i` in `mpp` is 1**

The code introduces a new variable `first` and assigns it the value `True`. The other variables remain unchanged, so the output state includes the new variable `first` with its assigned value, as well as the unchanged values of the other variables.
