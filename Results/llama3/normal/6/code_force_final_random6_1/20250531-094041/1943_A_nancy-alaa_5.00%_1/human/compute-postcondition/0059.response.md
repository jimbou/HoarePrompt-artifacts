Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer equal to the input integer, `arr` is a list of integers equal to the input list, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is the value of `i` increased by 1, `n` must be greater than `i`. If `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the next iteration.***
