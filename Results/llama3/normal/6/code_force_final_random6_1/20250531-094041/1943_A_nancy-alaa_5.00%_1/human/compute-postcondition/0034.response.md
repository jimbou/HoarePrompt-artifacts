Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `_` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code simply breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, without changing the values of any variables. The value of `i` which is 2 is being printed, but this does not affect the state of the program. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the additional information that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement.
