Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the input integer, `arr` is a list of integers equal to the input list, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `first` is False, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, and `i` is less than `n` and `i` is not a key in the dictionary `mpp`, and the value of `i` which is less than `n` and not a key in the dictionary `mpp` has been printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their previous values, but the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside. The value of `i` which is less than `n` and not a key in the dictionary `mpp` has been printed before breaking out of the loop or if statement.
