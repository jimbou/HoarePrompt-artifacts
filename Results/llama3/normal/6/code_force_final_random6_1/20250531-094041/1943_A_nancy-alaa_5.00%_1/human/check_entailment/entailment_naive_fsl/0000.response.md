Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the game strategy to maximize the MEX (minimum excludant) of Alice's array `c`. The program uses a Counter to count the occurrences of each number in the input array `arr`. It then iterates through the numbers from 0 to `n-1` and checks if the current number is not present in the Counter or if it is present only once and it's the second time it encounters a number with a count of 1. In either case, it prints the current number as the MEX of Alice's array `c`.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* When there are no zeros in the input array, the program prints the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.
* When there are zeros in the input array, the program prints the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array or the second smallest non-negative integer that is present only once in the array.
* When all numbers in the input array are distinct, the program prints the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.
* When there are duplicate numbers in the input array, the program prints the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array or the second smallest non-negative integer that is present only once in the array.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases according to the problem description. Therefore, the Correctness is **True**.
