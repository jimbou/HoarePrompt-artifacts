Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `first` is True, `_` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables do not change because the break statement does not affect the values of the variables. However, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement that we were directly inside. The rest of the information from the precondition is still valid after the code has been executed.
