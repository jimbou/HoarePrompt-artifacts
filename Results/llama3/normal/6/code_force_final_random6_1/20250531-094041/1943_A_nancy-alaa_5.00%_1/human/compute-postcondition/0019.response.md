Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `_` is 0. If `i` is a key in `mpp` and the frequency of `i` in `mpp` is 1, then `first` is set to True. Otherwise, no changes are made, and the value of `i` which is 1 is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `n`, `i`, `arr`, `mpp`, and `_` remain unchanged. The value of `first` is still dependent on the frequency of `i` in `mpp`, and the value of `i` is printed.
