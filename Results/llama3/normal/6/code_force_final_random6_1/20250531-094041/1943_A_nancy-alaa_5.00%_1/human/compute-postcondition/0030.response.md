Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `_` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code `break` does not change the values of any variables, but it causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional statement it is currently inside. The values of `n`, `i`, `arr`, `mpp`, and `_` remain the same as before the `break` statement was executed. The only change is that the program flow is altered, and we exit the innermost loop or conditional statement.
