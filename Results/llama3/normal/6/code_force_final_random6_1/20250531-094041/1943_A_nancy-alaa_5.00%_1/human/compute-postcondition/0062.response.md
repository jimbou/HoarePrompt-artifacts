Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the input integer, `arr` is a list of integers equal to the input list, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is the value of `i` increased by 1, `n` must be greater than `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `arr`, `mpp`, and `_` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still increased by 1, and `n` is still greater than `i`. However, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement due to the `break` statement.
