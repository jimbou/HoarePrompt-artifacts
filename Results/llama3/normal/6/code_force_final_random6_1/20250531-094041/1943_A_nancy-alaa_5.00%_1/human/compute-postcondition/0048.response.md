Based on the precondition, the value of `i` is a key in the dictionary `mpp` with a frequency of 1, and `first` is True.

The `print(i)` statement will print the current value of `i`, which is an integer less than `n` (the input integer) and is a key in the dictionary `mpp` with a frequency of 1.

Output: **i (where i is the current value of i, an integer less than n and a key in the dictionary mpp with a frequency of 1)**
