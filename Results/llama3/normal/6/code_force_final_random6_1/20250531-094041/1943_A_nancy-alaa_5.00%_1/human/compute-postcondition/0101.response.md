Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `_` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `arr`, `mpp`, and `_` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
