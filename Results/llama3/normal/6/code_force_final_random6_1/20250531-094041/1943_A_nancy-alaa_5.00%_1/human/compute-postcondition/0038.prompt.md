Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, arr is a list of integers, mpp is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in arr, first is False, _ is 0, stdin contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a list of integers
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if i not in mpp.keys():
        print(i)
        break
    if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
        print(i)
        break
    if mpp[i] == 1:
        first = True


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `_` is 0. If `i` is a key in `mpp` and the frequency of `i` in `mpp` is 1, then `first` is set to True. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `_` is 0. If `i` is not a key in `mpp`, then the value of `i` which is 1 is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is a key in `mpp` and the frequency of `i` in `mpp` is 1 and `first` is True, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `_` is 0. If `i` is a key in `mpp` and `mpp[i]` is 1 and `first` is True, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
