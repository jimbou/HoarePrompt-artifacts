Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the input integer, `arr` is a list of integers equal to the input list, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `first` is True, `_` is 1, `i` is less than `n`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `arr`, `mpp`, `first`, and `_` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still less than `n`, and the current value of `i` is still a key in the dictionary `mpp` with a frequency of 1. However, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.
