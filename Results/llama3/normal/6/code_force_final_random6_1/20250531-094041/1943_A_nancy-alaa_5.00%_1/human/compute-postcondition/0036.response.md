Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `_` is 0, `first` is True. If `i` is a key in `mpp` and `mpp[i]` is 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `first` is set to True. The values of the other variables remain the same. If `i` is a key in `mpp` and its frequency is 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
