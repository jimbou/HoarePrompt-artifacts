The code snippet provided reads two lines of input from stdin: an integer and a list of integers. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. The second line assigns a list of integers from the input to `arr`. The third line creates a dictionary `mpp` containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`. The fourth line sets `first` to `False`.

Output State: **n is an integer equal to the input integer, arr is a list of integers equal to the input list, mpp is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in arr, first is False, _ is 1, stdin is empty, i is n**
