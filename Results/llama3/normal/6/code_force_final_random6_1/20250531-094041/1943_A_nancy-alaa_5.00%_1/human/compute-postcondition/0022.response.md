Output: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `_` is 0. If `i` is not a key in `mpp`, then the value of `i` which is 1 is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is a key in `mpp` and the frequency of `i` in `mpp` is 1, then `first` is set to True. Otherwise, no changes are made, and the value of `i` which is 1 is printed**
