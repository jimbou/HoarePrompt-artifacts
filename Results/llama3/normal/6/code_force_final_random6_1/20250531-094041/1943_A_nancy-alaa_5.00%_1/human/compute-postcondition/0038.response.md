Output State: **n is an integer, arr is a list of integers, mpp is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in arr, first is True, _ is 0, stdin contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a list of integers, i is n.**

This output state means that after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `n`, and the value of `first` will be `True`. The other variables, `arr`, `mpp`, and `_`, will remain unchanged. The loop will have iterated over all the elements in the range of `n`, and the program will have either printed a value and broken out of the loop or completed all iterations without printing anything.
