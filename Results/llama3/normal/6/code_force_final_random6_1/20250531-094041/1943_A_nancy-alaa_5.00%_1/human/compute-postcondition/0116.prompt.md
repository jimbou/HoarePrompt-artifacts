Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, arr is a list of integers, mpp is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in arr, _ is 2, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, first is False
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if i not in mpp.keys():
        print(i)
        break
    if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
        print(i)
        break
    if mpp[i] == 1:
        first = True


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `_` is 2, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 0. If `i` is a key in `mpp` and the frequency of `i` in `arr` is 1, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement and `first` is set to True. Otherwise, no changes occur.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `_` is 2, `first` is True, `stdin` is empty. If `i` is in the keys of `mpp` and `mpp[i]` is not equal to 1 or `first` is True, no changes occur. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 3, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `_` is 2, `stdin` is empty. If `i` is not a key in `mpp` or if `mpp[i]` is not equal to 1 or if `first` is False, we continue with the rest of the program. If `mpp[i]` is equal to 1 and `first` is True, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
