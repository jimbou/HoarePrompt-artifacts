Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (the number of elements in the array) and then a space-separated list of integers (the elements of the array). The integer is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and the elements of the array are non-negative integers (0 <= a_i < n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mpp = Counter(arr)
    first = False
    for i in range(n):
        if i not in mpp.keys():
            print(i)
            break
        if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
            print(i)
            break
        if mpp[i] == 1:
            first = True


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer, arr is a list of integers, mpp is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in arr, first is True, _ is 0, stdin contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a list of integers, i is n.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer equal to the input integer, `arr` is a list of integers equal to the input list, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is equal to `n`, `first` is True if there exists a key `i` in `mpp` such that `mpp[i]` is 1, otherwise `first` is False.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer, arr is a list of integers, mpp is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in arr, _ is 2, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, first is True




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
