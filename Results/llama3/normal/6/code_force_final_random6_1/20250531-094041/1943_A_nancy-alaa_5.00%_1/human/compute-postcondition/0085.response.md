Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `_` is 2, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 0, `first` is False. If `i` is not a key in `mpp`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
