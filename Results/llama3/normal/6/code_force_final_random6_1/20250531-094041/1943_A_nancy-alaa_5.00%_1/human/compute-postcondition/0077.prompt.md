Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer equal to the input integer, arr is a list of integers equal to the input list, mpp is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in arr, first is False, _ is 1, stdin is empty, i is n
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if i not in mpp.keys():
        print(i)
        break
    if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
        print(i)
        break
    if mpp[i] == 1:
        first = True


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer equal to the input integer, `arr` is a list of integers equal to the input list, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty. If `i` is not a key in the dictionary `mpp`, the value of `i` has been printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is a key in the dictionary `mpp` and `first` is True and `mpp[i]` is 1, then `first` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken. The current value of `mpp[i]` is either 1 or not 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer equal to the input integer, `arr` is a list of integers equal to the input list, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is the value of `i` increased by 1, `n` must be greater than `i`. If `i` is in the keys of `mpp` and `mpp[i]` is equal to 1 and `first` is True, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the next iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer equal to the input integer, `arr` is a list of integers equal to the input list, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is the value of `i` increased by 1, `n` is greater than `i` increased by 1. If `i` is in the keys of `mpp` and `mpp[i]` is not equal to 1 or `first` is True, the program continues with the next iteration. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `first` is True.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
