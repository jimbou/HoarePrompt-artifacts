Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the input integer, `arr` is a list of integers equal to the input list, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is the value of `i` increased by 1, `n` is greater than `i` increased by 1. If `i` is in the keys of `mpp` and `mpp[i]` is not equal to 1 or `first` is True, the program continues with the next iteration. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `first` is True.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `arr`, `mpp`, `_`, `stdin`, `i`, and the relationship between `n` and `i` remain the same. The variable `first` is now set to True. The program will continue with the next iteration if `i` is in the keys of `mpp` and `mpp[i]` is not equal to 1 or if `first` is True, otherwise it will break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
