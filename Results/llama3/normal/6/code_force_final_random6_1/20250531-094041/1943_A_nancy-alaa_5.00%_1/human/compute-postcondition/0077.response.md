Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the input integer, `arr` is a list of integers equal to the input list, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is equal to `n`, `first` is True if there exists a key `i` in `mpp` such that `mpp[i]` is 1, otherwise `first` is False.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop iterates `n` times, where `n` is the input integer. The list `arr` and the dictionary `mpp` remain unchanged throughout the loop. The variable `_` is always 1, and the standard input `stdin` is empty.

The loop variable `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration. If `i` is not a key in the dictionary `mpp`, the program prints `i` and breaks out of the loop. If `i` is a key in `mpp` and its frequency is 1, and the flag `first` is True, the program prints `i` and breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues with the next iteration.

After the loop finishes executing all the iterations, the value of `i` is equal to `n`. The flag `first` is True if there exists a key `i` in `mpp` such that `mpp[i]` is 1, otherwise `first` is False.
