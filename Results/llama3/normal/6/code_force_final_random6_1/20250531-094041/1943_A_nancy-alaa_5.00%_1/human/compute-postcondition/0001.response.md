Output State: **n is an integer, arr is a list of integers, mpp is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in arr, first is False, _ is 0, stdin contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a list of integers**

Here's a breakdown of the output state:

*   `n` is an integer because it's assigned the value of an integer input from stdin.
*   `arr` is a list of integers because it's assigned the value of a list of integers input from stdin.
*   `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr` because it's assigned the value of a Counter object created from `arr`.
*   `first` is False because it's explicitly assigned this value.
*   `_` is 0 because its value doesn't change throughout the code execution.
*   stdin contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a list of integers because two inputs are consumed by the `input()` function calls.
