Precondition: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (the number of elements in the array) and then a space-separated list of integers (the elements of the array). The integer is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and the elements of the array are non-negative integers (0 <= a_i < n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
