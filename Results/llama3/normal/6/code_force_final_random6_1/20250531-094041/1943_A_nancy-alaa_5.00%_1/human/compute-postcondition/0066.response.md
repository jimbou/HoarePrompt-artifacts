The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the value of `i` increased by 1, `n` is greater than `i`. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than `i` increased by 1.
State: **`n` is an integer equal to the input integer, `arr` is a list of integers equal to the input list, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is the value of `i` increased by 1, `n` must be greater than `i` increased by 1. If `i` is in the keys of `mpp` and `mpp[i]` is equal to 1 and `first` is True, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the next iteration.**
