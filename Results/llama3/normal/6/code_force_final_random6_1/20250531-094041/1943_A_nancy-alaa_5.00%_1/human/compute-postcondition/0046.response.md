Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer equal to the input integer, `arr` is a list of integers equal to the input list, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `first` is False, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, and `i` is less than `n`. If `i` is not a key in the dictionary `mpp`, the value of `i` has been printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
