The only variable in the loop head is variable `_`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_`. If `_` is less than the number of test cases, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, stdin contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a list of integers. For the loop to execute again `_` must be 1 and stdin contains at least one test case minus one input: an integer and a list of integers.
State: **n is an integer, arr is a list of integers, mpp is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in arr, first is True, _ is 1, stdin contains at least one test case minus one input: an integer and a list of integers, i is n**
