Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the input integer, `arr` is a list of integers equal to the input list, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is the value of `i` increased by 1, `n` is greater than `i` increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `arr`, `mpp`, and `_` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is increased by 1, and the condition `n` is greater than `i` increased by 1 still holds. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and no further iterations are executed.
