Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `first` is False, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a list of integers. The current value of `i` is not a key in the dictionary `mpp`.**
