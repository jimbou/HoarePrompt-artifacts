To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The objects involved in the loop head are `_` and `int(input())`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 1, and `int(input())` is the input integer.

For the loop to execute again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `int(input())` must be greater than the current value of `_`.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `_` is 2
* `int(input())` must be greater than 2

The other variables `n`, `arr`, `mpp`, `stdin`, `i`, and `first` are not involved in the loop head, so their states remain the same.

State: **`n` is an integer equal to the input integer, `arr` is a list of integers equal to the input list, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `_` is 2, `stdin` is empty, `i` is equal to `n`, `first` is True if there exists a key `i` in `mpp` such that `mpp[i]` is 1, otherwise `first` is False, `int(input())` must be greater than 2**
