Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the input integer, `arr` is a list of integers equal to the input list, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `_` is 1, `first` is True, `stdin` is empty. If `i` is not a key in the dictionary `mpp`, the value of `i` has been printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is a key in the dictionary `mpp` and `first` is True and the current value of `mpp[i]` is 1, then `first` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken. The current value of `mpp[i]` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of the variable `first` being set to True. The values of the other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions for breaking out of the loop or if statement remain the same.
