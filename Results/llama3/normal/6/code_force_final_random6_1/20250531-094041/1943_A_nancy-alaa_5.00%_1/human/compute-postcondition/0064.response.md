Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the input integer, `arr` is a list of integers equal to the input list, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is the value of `i` increased by 1, `n` must be greater than `i`, `first` is True. If `i` is in the keys of `mpp` and `mpp[i]` is equal to 1 and `first` is True, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the next iteration.**

In this output state, the value of `first` has been set to True. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions regarding the relationship between `n`, `i`, and `mpp` are still valid. The program's control flow is also still dependent on the conditions specified in the initial state.
