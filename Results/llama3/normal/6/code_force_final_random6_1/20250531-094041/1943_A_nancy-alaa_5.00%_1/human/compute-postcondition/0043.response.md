The code prints the value of `i`, which is an integer less than `n` and not a key in the dictionary `mpp`. Since the exact value of `i` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `i`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the value of `i`.

Output: **i (where i is an integer less than n and not a key in the dictionary mpp)**
