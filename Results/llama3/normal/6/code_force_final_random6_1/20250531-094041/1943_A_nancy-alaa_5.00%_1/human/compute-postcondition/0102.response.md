Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `_` is 2, `stdin` is empty. If `i` is in the keys of `mpp` and `mpp[i]` is not equal to 1 or `first` is False, no changes occur. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
