Output State: **`a` is a list of digits from the first string of digits from stdin that is not empty, `b` is a list of digits from the second string of digits from stdin that must have at least 3 elements, stdin contains t-1 pairs of strings of digits, each pair having the same length. The digits in `a` and `b` are sorted in ascending order, `i` is equal to the length of `b`, and all elements of the list `b` have been printed in ascending order, and a new line is printed**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `b` has been fully printed in ascending order, and the loop counter `i` has reached the length of `b`. The state of `a` and the input from stdin remains unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop.
