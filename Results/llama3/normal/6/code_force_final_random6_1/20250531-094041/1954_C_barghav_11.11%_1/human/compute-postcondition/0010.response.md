Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of digits from the first string of digits from stdin, `b` is a list of digits from the second string of digits from stdin, stdin contains t-1 pairs of strings of digits, each pair having the same length. If `i` is less than or equal to half the length of `a` minus 1, the ith digit of `a` is the maximum of the original ith digits of `a` and `b`, and the ith digit of `b` is the minimum of the original ith digits of `a` and `b`. Otherwise, the ith digit of `a` is the smaller of the original digits at index `i` in `a` and `b`, and the ith digit of `b` is the larger of the original digits at index `i` in `a` and `b`. `i` is increased by 1, `n` is the minimum of the original ith digits of `a` and `b`, and `m` is the maximum of the original ith digits of `a` and `b`.***
