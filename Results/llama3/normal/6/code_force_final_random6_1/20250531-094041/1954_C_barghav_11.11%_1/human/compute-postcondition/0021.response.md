Output: **`a` is a list of digits from the first string of digits from stdin that is not empty, `b` is a list of digits from the second string of digits from stdin, stdin contains t-1 pairs of strings of digits, each pair having the same length. The digits in `a` and `b` are sorted in ascending order, `i` is 1, and the second element of the list `a` which is the second smallest digit from the first string of digits from stdin that is not empty is being printed, and this is printed: the second smallest digit from the first string of digits from stdin that is not empty**
