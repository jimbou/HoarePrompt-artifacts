Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of digits from the first string of digits from stdin that is not empty, `b` is a list of digits from the second string of digits from stdin, stdin contains t-1 pairs of strings of digits, each pair having the same length. The digits in `a` and `b` are sorted in ascending order, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, and all elements of the list `a` have been printed in ascending order, and a new line is printed
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(b)):
    print(b[i], end='')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list of digits from the first string of digits from stdin that is not empty, `b` is a list of digits from the second string of digits from stdin that must have at least 1 element, stdin contains t-1 pairs of strings of digits, each pair having the same length. The digits in `a` and `b` are sorted in ascending order, `i` is 0, and the first element of `b` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list of digits from the first string of digits from stdin that is not empty, `b` is a list of digits from the second string of digits from stdin that must have at least 2 elements, stdin contains t-1 pairs of strings of digits, each pair having the same length. The digits in `a` and `b` are sorted in ascending order, `i` is 1, and the 2nd element of the list `b` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of digits from the first string of digits from stdin that is not empty, `b` is a list of digits from the second string of digits from stdin that must have at least 2 elements, stdin contains t-1 pairs of strings of digits, each pair having the same length. The digits in `a` and `b` are sorted in ascending order, `i` is 2, the 2nd element of the list `b` has been printed, and the 3rd element of the list `b` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
