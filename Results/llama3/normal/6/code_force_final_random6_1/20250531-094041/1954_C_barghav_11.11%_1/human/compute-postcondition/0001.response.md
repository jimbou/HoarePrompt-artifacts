To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`. The loop will execute if `a` has at least one element. Since `a` is a list of digits from the first string of digits from stdin, we need to ensure that the first string of digits from stdin is not empty.

State: **`a` is a list of digits from the first string of digits from stdin that must have at least 1 digit, `b` is a list of digits from the second string of digits from stdin, stdin contains t-1 pairs of strings of digits, each pair having the same length, `i` is 0**
