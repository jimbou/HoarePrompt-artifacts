Output State: **a is a list of digits from the first string of digits from stdin, where each digit is the minimum of the original digits at the same index in a and b if the index is less than or equal to half the length of a minus 1, and the smaller of the original digits at the same index in a and b otherwise; b is a list of digits from the second string of digits from stdin, where each digit is the maximum of the original digits at the same index in a and b if the index is less than or equal to half the length of a minus 1, and the larger of the original digits at the same index in a and b otherwise; stdin contains t-1 pairs of strings of digits, each pair having the same length.**

In this output state, the code has modified the values of `a` and `b` based on the conditions specified in the initial state. The first half of the digits in `a` and `b` (up to half the length of `a` minus 1) have been swapped to be the minimum and maximum of the original digits at the same index, respectively. The second half of the digits in `a` and `b` have been swapped to be the smaller and larger of the original digits at the same index, respectively. The remaining pairs of strings of digits in stdin remain unchanged.
