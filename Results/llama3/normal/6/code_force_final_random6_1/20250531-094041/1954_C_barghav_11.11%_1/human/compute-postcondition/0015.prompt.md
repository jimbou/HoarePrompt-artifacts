Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is a list of digits from the first string of digits from stdin, b is a list of digits from the second string of digits from stdin, stdin contains t-1 pairs of strings of digits, each pair having the same length.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if i <= len(a) // 2 - 1:
        n = min(a[i], b[i])
        m = max(a[i], b[i])
        a[i] = m
        b[i] = n
    else:
        n = min(a[i], b[i])
        m = max(a[i], b[i])
        a[i] = n
        b[i] = m


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is a list of digits from the first string of digits from stdin, `b` is a list of digits from the second string of digits from stdin, stdin contains t-1 pairs of strings of digits, each pair having the same length. If `i` is less than or equal to half the length of `a` minus 1, the ith digit of `a` is the maximum of the original ith digits of `a` and `b`, and the ith digit of `b` is the minimum of the original ith digits of `a` and `b`. Otherwise, the ith digit of `a` is the smaller of the original digits at index `i` in `a` and `b`, and the ith digit of `b` is the larger of the original digits at index `i` in `a` and `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is a list of digits from the first string of digits from stdin, `b` is a list of digits from the second string of digits from stdin, stdin contains t-1 pairs of strings of digits, each pair having the same length. If `i` is less than or equal to half the length of `a` minus 1, the ith digit of `a` is the maximum of the original ith digits of `a` and `b`, and the ith digit of `b` is the minimum of the original ith digits of `a` and `b`. Otherwise, the ith digit of `a` is the smaller of the original digits at index `i` in `a` and `b`, and the ith digit of `b` is the larger of the original digits at index `i` in `a` and `b`. `i` is increased by 1, `n` is the minimum of the original ith digits of `a` and `b`, and `m` is the maximum of the original ith digits of `a` and `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` and `b` are lists of digits from the first and second strings of digits from stdin, respectively. If `i` is less than or equal to half the length of `a` minus 1, the first half of the digits in `a` are the maximum of the original digits of `a` and `b`, and the second half of the digits in `a` are the minimum of the original digits of `a` and `b`. The first half of the digits in `b` are the minimum of the original digits of `a` and `b`, and the second half of the digits in `b` are the maximum of the original digits of `a` and `b`. Otherwise, the first half of the digits in `a` are the minimum of the original digits at the same index in `a` and `b`, and the second half of the digits in `a` are the smaller of the original digits at the same index in `a` and `b`. The first half of the digits in `b` are the maximum of the original digits at the same index in `a` and `b`, and the second half of the digits in `b` are the larger of the original digits at the same index in `a` and `b`. In both cases, `i` is increased by 1, `n` is the minimum of the original ith digits of `a` and `b`, and `m` is the maximum of the original ith digits of `a` and `b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
