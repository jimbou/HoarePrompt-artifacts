Output State: **a is a list of digits from the first string of digits from stdin, b is a list of digits from the second string of digits from stdin, stdin contains t-1 pairs of strings of digits, each pair having the same length. If i is less than or equal to half the length of a minus 1, the ith digit of a is the maximum of the original ith digits of a and b, and the ith digit of b is the minimum of the original ith digits of a and b. Otherwise, the ith digit of a is the smaller of the original digits at index i in a and b, and the ith digit of b is the larger of the original digits at index i in a and b. i is increased by 1, n is the minimum of the original ith digits of a and b, m is the maximum of the original ith digits of a and b.**

In this final state, the code has swapped the values of `a[i]` and `b[i]` based on their original values, and updated the values of `n` and `m` to be the minimum and maximum of the original `i`th digits of `a` and `b`, respectively. The rest of the state remains unchanged.
