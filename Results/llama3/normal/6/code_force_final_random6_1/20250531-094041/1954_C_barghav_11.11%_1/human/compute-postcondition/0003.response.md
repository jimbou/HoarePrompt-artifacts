The code snippet swaps the values of `a[i]` and `b[i]` if `a[i]` is less than `b[i]`. 

Output State: **a is a list of digits from the first string of digits from stdin where the ith digit is the maximum of the original ith digits of a and b, b is a list of digits from the second string of digits from stdin where the ith digit is the minimum of the original ith digits of a and b, stdin contains t-1 pairs of strings of digits, each pair having the same length, i is less than or equal to half the length of a minus 1**
