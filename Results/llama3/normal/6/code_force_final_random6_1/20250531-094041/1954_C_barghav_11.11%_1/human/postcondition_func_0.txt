This function reads two strings of digits from standard input, sorts the first half of the digits in ascending order and the second half in descending order, and then prints the sorted digits in ascending order, followed by a newline. The function repeats this process for multiple pairs of strings, where the number of pairs is specified by an integer at the beginning of the input.
