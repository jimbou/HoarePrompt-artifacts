Output State: **a is a list of digits where the first half of the digits are the minimum of the original digits at the same index in a and b, and the second half of the digits are the smaller of the original digits at the same index in a and b, b is a list of digits where the first half of the digits are the maximum of the original digits at the same index in a and b, and the second half of the digits are the larger of the original digits at the same index in a and b, i is increased by 1, n is the minimum of the original ith digits of a and b, and m is the maximum of the original ith digits of a and b, stdin contains t-1 pairs of strings of digits, each pair having the same length.**

In this output state, the first half of the digits in `a` are the minimum of the original digits at the same index in `a` and `b`, and the second half of the digits are the smaller of the original digits at the same index in `a` and `b`. Similarly, the first half of the digits in `b` are the maximum of the original digits at the same index in `a` and `b`, and the second half of the digits are the larger of the original digits at the same index in `a` and `b`. The value of `i` is increased by 1, and `n` and `m` are updated to be the minimum and maximum of the original ith digits of `a` and `b`, respectively. The state of stdin remains the same, containing t-1 pairs of strings of digits, each pair having the same length.
