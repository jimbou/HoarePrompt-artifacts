Based on the initial state, we can determine the output of the print statement as follows:

* `a` is a list of digits from the first string of digits from stdin that is not empty.
* `b` is a list of digits from the second string of digits from stdin that must have at least 1 element.
* The digits in `a` and `b` are sorted in ascending order.
* `i` is 0.

The print statement `print(b[i], end='')` will print the element at index `i` of the list `b`. Since `i` is 0, it will print the first element of the list `b`.

Since the digits in `b` are sorted in ascending order, the first element of `b` will be the smallest digit in the list.

Therefore, the output will be the smallest digit in the list `b`.

Output: **the smallest digit in the list b**
