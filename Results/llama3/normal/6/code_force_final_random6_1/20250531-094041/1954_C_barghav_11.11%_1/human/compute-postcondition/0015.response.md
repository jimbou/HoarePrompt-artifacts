Output State: **a is a list of digits from the first string of digits from stdin, b is a list of digits from the second string of digits from stdin, stdin contains t-1 pairs of strings of digits, each pair having the same length. The digits in a and b are sorted in ascending order.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the lists `a` and `b` will contain the same digits as the original input strings, but they will be sorted in ascending order. The first half of the digits in `a` will be the smaller digits, and the second half will be the larger digits. Similarly, the first half of the digits in `b` will be the larger digits, and the second half will be the smaller digits. The `stdin` will still contain `t-1` pairs of strings of digits, each pair having the same length.
