Output State: **a is a list of digits from the first string of digits from stdin, where the first half of the digits are the maximum of the original digits of a and b, and the second half of the digits are the minimum of the original digits of a and b; b is a list of digits from the second string of digits from stdin, where the first half of the digits are the minimum of the original digits of a and b, and the second half of the digits are the maximum of the original digits of a and b; stdin contains t-1 pairs of strings of digits, each pair having the same length; i is increased by 1; n is the minimum of the original ith digits of a and b; m is the maximum of the original ith digits of a and b.**

In this output state, the first half of the digits in `a` are the maximum of the original digits of `a` and `b`, and the second half of the digits in `a` are the minimum of the original digits of `a` and `b`. Similarly, the first half of the digits in `b` are the minimum of the original digits of `a` and `b`, and the second half of the digits in `b` are the maximum of the original digits of `a` and `b`. The value of `i` is increased by 1, and `n` and `m` are updated to be the minimum and maximum of the original ith digits of `a` and `b`, respectively. The remaining pairs of strings of digits in stdin are unchanged.
