Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are lists of digits from the first and second strings of digits from stdin, respectively. If `i` is less than or equal to half the length of `a` minus 1, the first half of the digits in `a` are the maximum of the original digits of `a` and `b`, and the second half of the digits in `a` are the minimum of the original digits of `a` and `b`. The first half of the digits in `b` are the minimum of the original digits of `a` and `b`, and the second half of the digits in `b` are the maximum of the original digits of `a` and `b`. Otherwise, the first half of the digits in `a` are the minimum of the original digits at the same index in `a` and `b`, and the second half of the digits in `a` are the smaller of the original digits at the same index in `a` and `b`. The first half of the digits in `b` are the maximum of the original digits at the same index in `a` and `b`, and the second half of the digits in `b` are the larger of the original digits at the same index in `a` and `b`. In both cases, `i` is increased by 1, `n` is the minimum of the original ith digits of `a` and `b`, and `m` is the maximum of the original ith digits of `a` and `b`.**
