Output State: **`a` is a list of digits from the first string of digits from stdin that is not empty, `b` is a list of digits from the second string of digits from stdin, stdin contains t-1 pairs of strings of digits, each pair having the same length. The digits in `a` and `b` are sorted in ascending order, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, and all elements of the list `a` have been printed in ascending order.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop executes all its iterations, the loop variable `i` will have reached the length of the list `a`, and all elements of `a` will have been printed in ascending order, from the smallest digit to the largest. The state of `b` and the input from stdin remains unchanged.
