Based on the precondition, we know that `a` is a list of digits from the first string of digits from stdin that is not empty, and `b` is a list of digits from the second string of digits from stdin. The digits in `a` and `b` are sorted in ascending order. We also know that `i` is 2.

The print statement `print(a[i], end='')` will print the element at index `i` of the list `a`. Since `i` is 2, we need to find the element at index 2 of the list `a`.

Since the digits in `a` are sorted in ascending order, the element at index 2 will be the third smallest digit in the list `a`.

However, we don't have the exact values of the digits in `a`. We only know that they are digits from the first string of digits from stdin that is not empty.

Therefore, we can't determine the exact value of the element at index 2 of the list `a`. But we can describe it as the third smallest digit in the list `a`.

Output: **the third smallest digit in the list a**
