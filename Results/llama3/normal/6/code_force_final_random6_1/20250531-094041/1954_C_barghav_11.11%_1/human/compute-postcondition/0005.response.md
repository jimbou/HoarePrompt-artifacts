Output State: **a is a list of digits from the first string of digits from stdin, where the digit at index i is the smaller of the original digits at index i in a and b, b is a list of digits from the second string of digits from stdin, where the digit at index i is the larger of the original digits at index i in a and b, i is larger than len(a) // 2 - 1, stdin contains t-1 pairs of strings of digits, each pair having the same length.**

In this output state, the value of `a[i]` has been replaced with the smaller of the original values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and the value of `b[i]` has been replaced with the larger of the original values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. The rest of the elements in `a` and `b` remain unchanged. The value of `i` remains larger than `len(a) // 2 - 1`, and the contents of `stdin` are unchanged.
