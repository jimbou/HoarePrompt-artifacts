Output State: **The loop will execute until it has processed all the lines in the input, printing the difference between the total number of tokens and the number of unique tokens for each line that is 2 positions ahead of a multiple of 4 (i.e., lines at positions 2, 6, 10, ...).**

In natural language, the loop will continue to execute until it has processed all the lines in the input. For each line that is 2 positions ahead of a multiple of 4 (i.e., lines at positions 2, 6, 10, ...), it will print the difference between the total number of tokens in that line and the number of unique tokens in that line.
