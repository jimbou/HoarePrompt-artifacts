The only objects in the loop head are variables  line and open(0), so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the file object open(0).  If the file object has at least 7 lines the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, open(0) has at least 5 lines, line is the fifth line. So for the loop to be executed one more time the file object must have at least 7 lines and the line is the seventh line.
State: **`stdin` contains multiple test cases, `open(0)` is a file object that must have at least 7 lines, `line` is the seventh line, and this is printed: the difference between the number of tokens in the seventh line and the number of unique tokens in the seventh line**
