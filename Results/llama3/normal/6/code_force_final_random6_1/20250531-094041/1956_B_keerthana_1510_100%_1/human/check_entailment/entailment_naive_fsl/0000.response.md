Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of points that can be scored by playing the card game optimally. The program reads the input from the standard input, where each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains the number of cards, and the second line contains the integers on the cards in the player's hand.

The program uses the fact that the maximum number of points that can be scored is equal to the number of pairs of identical integers in the player's hand. This is because the player can score a point by playing a card that has a matching card already on the table, and the optimal strategy is to play the pairs of identical cards first.

The program uses the `set` data structure to count the number of unique integers in the player's hand, and then subtracts this count from the total number of cards to get the number of pairs. This is done in the line `print(len((tokens := line.split())) - len({*tokens}))`.

The program correctly handles the case where there are no pairs of identical integers in the player's hand, in which case the output is 0.

Overall, the program is correct and efficiently implements the logic to solve the problem.
