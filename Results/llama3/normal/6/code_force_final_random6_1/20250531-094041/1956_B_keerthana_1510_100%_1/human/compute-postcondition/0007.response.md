Based on the precondition, here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. `open(0)` is a file object that must have at least 7 lines, which means it contains multiple lines of input.
2. `line` is the seventh line of the input, which is a string.
3. `tokens := line.split()` splits the seventh line into a list of tokens (words or substrings) using whitespace as the delimiter. This is done using the Walrus operator (`:=`), which assigns the result of the expression to the variable `tokens`.
4. `len(tokens)` calculates the number of tokens in the list.
5. `{*tokens}` creates a set from the list of tokens, which removes duplicates. The `*` operator unpacks the list into individual elements, which are then added to the set.
6. `len({*tokens})` calculates the number of unique tokens in the set.
7. The expression `len(tokens) - len({*tokens})` calculates the difference between the number of tokens and the number of unique tokens.

Output: **the difference between the number of tokens in the seventh line and the number of unique tokens in the seventh line**
