Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, l is 0, r is n - 1, sunks is 0
Code of the loop:
while l <= r:
    if k == 0:
        break
    if l == r:
        if k >= a[r]:
            sunks += 1
            break
        break
    if a[l] <= a[r]:
        if k >= a[l] * 2:
            k -= a[l] * 2
            a[r] -= a[l]
            if a[r] == 0:
                sunks += 1
                r -= 1
            sunks += 1
            l += 1
            continue
        elif a[l] * 2 - 1 == k:
            sunks += 1
            break
        else:
            break
    if k == 0:
        break
    if a[r] < a[l]:
        if k >= a[r] * 2:
            k -= a[r] * 2
            a[l] -= a[r]
            if a[l] == 0:
                sunks += 1
                l += 1
            sunks += 1
            r -= 1
            continue
        elif a[r] * 2 - 1 == k:
            sunks += 1
            break
        else:
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers. If `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, then if `k` is greater than or equal to twice the value of the element at index `r` in list `a`, then the value of the element at index `l` in list `a` is reduced by the value of the element at index `r` in list `a`, `k` is reduced by twice the value of the element at index `r` in list `a`, and if the value of the element at index `l` in list `a` is 0, then `sunks` is 1, the value of the element at index `l` in list `a` is 0, and `l` is incremented by 1, `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `k` is less than twice the value of the element at index `r` in list `a`, then if `k` is equal to twice the value of the element at index `r` minus 1, `sunks` is 1, otherwise `sunks` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[r]` is not less than `a[l]`, then if `k` is greater than or equal to twice the value of the element at index `l` in list `a`, then `l` is incremented by 1, `r` remains `n - 1`, and `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `k` is less than twice the value of the element at index `l` in list `a`, then `l` and `r` remain unchanged, and if `k` is equal to (`a[l] * 2 - 1`), then `sunks` is set to 1, otherwise `sunks` remains 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l` is equal to `r` and both are equal to `n - 1`, then `sunks` is 1 if `k` is greater than or equal to the value of the element at index `r` in list `a`, otherwise `sunks` remains 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, then if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r] * 2`, `k` is reduced by 2 times the value of `a[r]`, the value at index `r` in `a` is reduced by the value at index `l`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, sunks is either two more than its original value if `l` equals `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]` after the reduction, or one more than its original value if `l` equals `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]` after the reduction, or one more than its original value if `a[l]` is 0, `r` is one less than its original value. If `k` is less than `a[r] * 2`, then if `a[r] * 2 - 1` equals `k`, `sunks` is one more than its original value. Otherwise, if `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, then if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l] * 2`, `k` is reduced by 2 times the value of `a[l]`, the value at index `r` in `a` is reduced by the value at index `l`, `l` is increased by 1, and `sunks` is one more than its original value if `l` equals `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]` after the reduction, otherwise `sunks` is two more than its original value if `l` equals `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]` after the reduction, and `r` is decreased by 1. If `k` is less than `a[l] * 2`, then if `a[l] * 2 - 1` equals `k`, `sunks` is one more than its original value. If `a[l] * 2 - 1` does not equal `k`, then if `l` is equal to `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, `sunks` is one more than its original value. Otherwise, no change occurs. If `a[l]` is greater than `a[r]`, then if `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs. If `l` is equal to `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, then `sunks` is one more than its original value. Otherwise, no change occurs. We are now outside of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` is less than `r`. If `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, then if `k` is greater than or equal to twice the value of the integer at index `r-1` in list `a`, then `k` is decremented by twice the value at index `r-1`, the value at index `l` in list `a` is decremented by the value at index `r-1`. If the value at index `l` in list `a` is 0, then `l` is equal to its original value plus 1 and `sunks` is a positive integer greater than its original value by 3. Otherwise, the values of `l` and `sunks` remain unchanged. If `k` is less than twice the value of the integer at index `r-1` in list `a`, then if `a[r] * 2 - 1` equals `k`, `sunks` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, then if `k` is greater than or equal to twice the value of the integer at index `l` in list `a`, then `k` is decremented by twice the value at index `l`, the value at index `r` in list `a` is decremented by the value at index `l`, `l` is incremented by 1, and `sunks` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `a[l] * 2 - 1` equals `k`, then `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `l` equals `r`, then if `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute. If `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, then `sunks` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no action is taken, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l` is not equal to `r`, then no action is taken. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
