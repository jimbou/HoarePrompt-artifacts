Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, l is less than n - 1, r is n - 1, the value of the element at index r in list a is less than the value of the element at index l in list a, k is greater than or equal to twice the value of the element at index r in list a, the value of the element at index l in list a is reduced by the value of the element at index r in list a, k is reduced by twice the value of the element at index r in list a. If the value of the element at index l in list a is 0, then sunks is 1, the value of the element at index l in list a is 0, and l is incremented by 1.***
