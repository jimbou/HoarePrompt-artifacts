Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs. If `l` is equal to `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, then `sunks` is one more than its original value. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
