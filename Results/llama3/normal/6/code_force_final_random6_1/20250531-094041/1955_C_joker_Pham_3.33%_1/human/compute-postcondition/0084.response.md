Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` is less than `r`. If `a[l] * 2 - 1` equals `k`, then `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `l` equals `r`, then if `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute. If `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, then `sunks` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no action is taken, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l` is not equal to `r`, then no action is taken.***
