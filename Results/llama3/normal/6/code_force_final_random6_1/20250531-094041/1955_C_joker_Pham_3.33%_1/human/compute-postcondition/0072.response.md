Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` is less than `r`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged. The only effect of the `break` statement is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement that we were directly inside.
