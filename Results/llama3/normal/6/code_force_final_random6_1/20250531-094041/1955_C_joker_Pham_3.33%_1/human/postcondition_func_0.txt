This function takes a list of positive integers and two positive integers as input, and returns the number of integers that can be "sunk" by repeatedly subtracting the smaller of the two end elements of the list from the larger one, until the list is exhausted or the subtraction value reaches zero. The function modifies the input list in place, reducing the values of its elements as it performs the subtractions. The returned value represents the count of "sunk" integers, which is a positive integer.
