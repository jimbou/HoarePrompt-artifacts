Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer reduced by 2 times the value of a[r], a is a list of n positive integers where the value at index l is reduced by the value at index r, l is less than or equal to r, sunks is either one more than its original value if l equals r and k is greater than or equal to a[r] after the reduction, or two more than its original value if l equals r and k is greater than or equal to a[r] after the reduction. If a[l] is 0, then l is one more than its original value and sunks is one more than its original value.***
