Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer minus 2 times the value of a[l], a is a list of n positive integers where the value at index r is reduced by the value at index l, l is less than or equal to r plus 1, sunks is one more than its original value if l equals r and k is greater than or equal to a[r] after the reduction, otherwise sunks is two more than its original value if l equals r and k is greater than or equal to a[r] after the reduction, and r is one less than its original value.**
