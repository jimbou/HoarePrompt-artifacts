Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `k` is 0, we are now outside of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, then if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l] * 2`, `k` is reduced by 2 times the value of `a[l]`, the value at index `r` in `a` is reduced by the value at index `l`, `l` is increased by 1, and `sunks` is one more than its original value if `l` equals `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]` after the reduction, otherwise `sunks` is two more than its original value if `l` equals `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]` after the reduction, and `r` is decreased by 1. If `k` is less than `a[l] * 2`, then if `a[l] * 2 - 1` equals `k`, `sunks` is one more than its original value. If `a[l] * 2 - 1` does not equal `k`, then if `l` is equal to `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, `sunks` is one more than its original value. Otherwise, no change occurs. If `a[l]` is greater than `a[r]`, then if `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs. If `l` is equal to `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, then `sunks` is one more than its original value. Otherwise, no change occurs. We are now outside of the most internal loop or if statement.**
