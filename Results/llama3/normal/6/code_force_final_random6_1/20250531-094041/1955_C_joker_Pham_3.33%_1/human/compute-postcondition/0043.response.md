Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers. If `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, then if `k` is greater than or equal to twice the value of the element at index `r` in list `a`, then the value of the element at index `l` in list `a` is reduced by the value of the element at index `r` in list `a`, `k` is reduced by twice the value of the element at index `r` in list `a`, and if the value of the element at index `l` in list `a` is 0, then `sunks` is 1, the value of the element at index `l` in list `a` is 0, and `l` is incremented by 1, `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `k` is less than twice the value of the element at index `r` in list `a`, then if `k` is equal to twice the value of the element at index `r` minus 1, `sunks` is 1, otherwise `sunks` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[r]` is not less than `a[l]`, then if `k` is greater than or equal to twice the value of the element at index `l` in list `a`, then `l` is incremented by 1, `r` remains `n - 1`, and `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `k` is less than twice the value of the element at index `l` in list `a`, then `l` and `r` remain unchanged, and if `k` is equal to (`a[l] * 2 - 1`), then `sunks` is set to 1, otherwise `sunks` remains 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l` is equal to `r` and both are equal to `n - 1`, then `sunks` is 1 if `k` is greater than or equal to the value of the element at index `r` in list `a`, otherwise `sunks` remains 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
