Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers. The current value of `l` is less than `n - 1`, and the current value of `r` is `n - 1`. The current value of `sunks` is 0. The value of the element at index `r` in list `a` is less than the value of the element at index `l` in list `a`. `k` is less than twice the value of the element at index `r` in list `a`. The value of `k` is not equal to twice the value of the element at index `r` minus 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the additional information that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` remain unchanged.
