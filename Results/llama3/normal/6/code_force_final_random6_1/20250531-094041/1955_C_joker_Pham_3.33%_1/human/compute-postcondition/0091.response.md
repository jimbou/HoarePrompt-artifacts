Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer less than its original value by twice the value of the integer at index r in list a, a is a list of n positive integers where the value at index l is less than its original value by the value at index r. If the value at index l in list a is 0, then l is equal to its original value plus 1 and sunks is a positive integer greater than its original value by 2. Otherwise, the values of l and sunks remain unchanged.***
