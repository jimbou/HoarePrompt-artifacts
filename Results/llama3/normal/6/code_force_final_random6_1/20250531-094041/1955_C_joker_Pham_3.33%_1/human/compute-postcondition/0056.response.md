Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `k` is 0, we are now outside of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs. If `l` is equal to `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, then `sunks` is one more than its original value. Otherwise, no change occurs.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `k` is 0. Additionally, if `l` is equal to `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, then `sunks` is incremented by 1.
