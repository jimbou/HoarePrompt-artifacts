According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `r`. If `l` is less than or equal to `r`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `n` is a positive integer. Since `n` is a positive integer, `n - 1` is non-negative, so `r` is non-negative. Therefore, `l` (which is 0) is always less than or equal to `r`, so the loop can certainly execute one time.

State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, l is 0, r is n - 1, sunks is 0**
