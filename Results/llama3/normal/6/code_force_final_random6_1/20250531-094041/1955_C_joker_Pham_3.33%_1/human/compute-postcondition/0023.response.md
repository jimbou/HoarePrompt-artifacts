Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, l is 0, r is n - 1. The current value of a[l] is less than or equal to the current value of a[r]. k is less than a[l] * 2. If the current value of k is equal to (a[l] * 2 - 1), then sunks is 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and sunks is 0.***
