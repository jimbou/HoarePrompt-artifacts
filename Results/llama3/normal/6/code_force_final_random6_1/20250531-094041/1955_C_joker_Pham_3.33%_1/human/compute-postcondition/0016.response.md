Postcondition: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, l is 0, r is n - 1, sunks is 0. The current value of k is greater than or equal to twice the current value of a[l]. If k is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made. If l is equal to r and both are equal to n - 1, then sunks is 1 if k is greater than or equal to the value of the element at index r in list a, otherwise sunks remains 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The current value of a[l] is less than or equal to the current value of a[r]. If a[r] is 0, then r is n - 2, sunks is 1, and the current value of a[r] is 0.**
