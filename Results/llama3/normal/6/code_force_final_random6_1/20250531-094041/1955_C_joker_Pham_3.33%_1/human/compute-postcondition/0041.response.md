Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers. The current value of `l` is less than `n - 1`, and the current value of `r` is `n - 1`. The value of the element at index `r` in list `a` is less than the value of the element at index `l` in list `a`. `k` is less than twice the value of the element at index `r` in list `a`. If `k` is equal to twice the value of the element at index `r` minus 1, then the current value of `sunks` is 1. Otherwise, the current value of `sunks` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
