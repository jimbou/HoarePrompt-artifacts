Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `a[l] * 2 - 1` equals `k`, then `sunks` is one more than its original value. If `a[l] * 2 - 1` does not equal `k`, then if `k` is 0, we are now outside of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `l` is equal to `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, then `sunks` is one more than its original value. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
