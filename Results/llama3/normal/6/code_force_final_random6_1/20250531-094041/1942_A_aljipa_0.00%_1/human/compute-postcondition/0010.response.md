Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), n is an integer, k is an integer, res is a list of length n with values of either 1, a range from 0 to n-1, or -1, and the elements of the list res which are either 1, a range from 0 to n-1, or -1 are being printed**

In this output state, the value of t remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The stdin now contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers n and k, because one line has been read by the input() function. The values of n and k are updated to the values read from the input. The list res is created with a length of n and its elements are either all 1s (if k is equal to n), a range from 0 to n-1 (if k is equal to 1), or all -1s (if k is neither 1 nor n). The elements of the list res are being printed.
