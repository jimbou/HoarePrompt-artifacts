Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when n = 3 and k = 2, the program outputs [-1], but it should output a valid array a that satisfies the requirements. 

In this case, a valid array a could be [1, 2, 1], which has exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts: [1, 2, 1] and [2, 1, 1]. However, the program does not output this array, and instead outputs -1, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program is not correct for all potential cases, and the Correctness is **False**.
