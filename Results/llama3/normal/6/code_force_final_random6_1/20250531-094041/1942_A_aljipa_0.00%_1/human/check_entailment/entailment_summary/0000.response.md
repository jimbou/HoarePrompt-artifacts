Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly handles the three possible cases for the values of n and k:

1. If k equals n, it generates a list of all 1s, which satisfies the condition that all cyclic shifts of the list are sorted.
2. If k equals 1, it generates a list containing a range of numbers from 0 to n-1, which satisfies the condition that exactly one cyclic shift of the list is sorted.
3. If k is neither 1 nor n, it generates a list containing a single -1, indicating that there is no valid array a that satisfies the given conditions.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
