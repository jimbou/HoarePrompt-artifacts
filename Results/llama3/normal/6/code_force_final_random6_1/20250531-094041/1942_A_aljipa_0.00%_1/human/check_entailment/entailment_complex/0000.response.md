Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding an array `a` of length `n` that has exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts. The program uses a simple and efficient approach to generate the array based on the values of `n` and `k`.

If `k` equals `n`, the program generates an array of all 1s, which satisfies the condition of having all cyclic shifts sorted.

If `k` equals 1, the program generates an array of numbers from 0 to `n-1`, which satisfies the condition of having exactly one sorted cyclic shift.

If `k` is neither 1 nor `n`, the program generates an array containing a single -1, indicating that there is no valid array that satisfies the condition.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases of `n` and `k` as specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
