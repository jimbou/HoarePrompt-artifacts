Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of sorted cyclic shifts `k`.
3. The program then constructs the result array `res` based on the values of `n` and `k`. There are three cases:
	* If `k == n`, it means all cyclic shifts must be sorted, so the array can be filled with ones (`[1] * n`).
	* If `k == 1`, it means only one cyclic shift must be sorted, so the array can be filled with a range from 0 to `n-1` (`range(n)`).
	* If `k` is neither `n` nor 1, it means there is no valid array, so the result is a list containing only `-1` (`[-1]`).
4. Finally, the program prints the elements of the result array `res` using the `*` operator to unpack the list.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and produces the expected output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
