The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of the first input integer to `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by `t` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3). After the code is executed, the value of `t` is assigned, and the stdin now contains `t` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^3), stdin contains `t` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3)**
