The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t. If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, t must be decreased by 1, so t is greater than 0.
State: **t is an integer greater than 0, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), n is an integer, k is an integer, res is a list of length n with values of either 1, a range from 0 to n-1, or -1, and the elements of the list res which are either 1, a range from 0 to n-1, or -1 are being printed**
