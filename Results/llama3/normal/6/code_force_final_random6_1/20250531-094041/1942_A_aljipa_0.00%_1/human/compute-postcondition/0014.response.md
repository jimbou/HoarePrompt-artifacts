Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each case consists of two integers n and k. It then generates a list of length n based on the values of n and k. If k equals n, the list contains all 1s. If k equals 1, the list contains a range of numbers from 0 to n-1. Otherwise, the list contains a single -1. The function prints the generated list for each test case.**
