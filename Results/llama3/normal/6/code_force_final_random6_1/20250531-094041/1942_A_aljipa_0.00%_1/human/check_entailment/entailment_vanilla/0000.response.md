Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding an array that satisfies the conditions of having exactly k sorted cyclic shifts out of n total cyclic shifts.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases (t) and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads two integers n and k, where n is the length of the array and k is the number of sorted cyclic shifts required.

3. The program then uses a conditional expression to determine the array that satisfies the conditions. There are three possible cases:

   - If k is equal to n, it means that all cyclic shifts must be sorted. In this case, the program creates an array of n ones ([1] * n), because an array of all ones has all its cyclic shifts sorted.

   - If k is equal to 1, it means that only one cyclic shift must be sorted. In this case, the program creates an array of numbers from 0 to n-1 (range(n)), because the array [0, 1, 2, ..., n-1] has only one sorted cyclic shift.

   - If k is neither equal to n nor 1, it means that there is no array that satisfies the conditions (because if k is greater than 1, then at least two cyclic shifts must be sorted, but if k is less than n, then not all cyclic shifts can be sorted). In this case, the program outputs -1.

4. Finally, the program prints the resulting array (or -1 if no array is found) for each test case.

Based on this analysis, the program correctly solves the problem and handles all possible cases.

Correctness: **True**
