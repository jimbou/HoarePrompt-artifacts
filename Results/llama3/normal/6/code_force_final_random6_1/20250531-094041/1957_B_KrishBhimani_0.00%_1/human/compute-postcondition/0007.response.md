The only variable in the loop head is variable k, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable k.  If k is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9 divided by 2, So for the loop to be executed one more time k must be greater than 0.
State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9 divided by 2 and k is greater than 0, if k is odd, arr is a list containing one element, which is 0, otherwise arr is an empty list, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, i is 1, _ is 0, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing two integers n and k**
