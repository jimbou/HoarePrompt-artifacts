The only variable in the loop head is variable _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than the value returned by int(input()), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 1, int(input()) is t-4. So for the loop to be executed one more time _ is 2 and int(input()) is t-4.
State: **`k` is 0, `i` is the last element in the list, `arr` is an empty list, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `k0` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `_` is 2, stdin contains t-5 lines, each containing two integers n and k, `c` is equal to n, `ans` is a list containing n elements, where the last element is k0 - sum(ans) and the rest are 1 << i for each i in the original list, `l1` is a list containing two integers n and k, and the length of `ans` is now equal to `n`, and the elements of the list `ans` are being printed**
