The code `arr.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the end of the list `arr`. Since `i` is 0, the list `arr` now contains one element, which is 0. The other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`arr` is a list containing one element, which is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is an odd integer between 1 and 10^9, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, i is 0, _ is 0**
