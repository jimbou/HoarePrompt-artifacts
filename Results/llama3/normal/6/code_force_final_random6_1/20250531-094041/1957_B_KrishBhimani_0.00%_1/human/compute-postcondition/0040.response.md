Output State: **k is an integer between 1 and 10^9, i is 1, arr is a list containing one element 0 if k is odd, otherwise it is an empty list, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, _ is 1, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers n and k, c is equal to n, ans is a list containing n elements equal to 1 << i, l1 is a list containing two integers n and k, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `k` and `i`. The first line shifts the bits of `k` one position to the right, effectively dividing it by 2. Since `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, the new value of `k` will also be an integer between 1 and 10^9. The second line increments `i` by 1, making it 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
