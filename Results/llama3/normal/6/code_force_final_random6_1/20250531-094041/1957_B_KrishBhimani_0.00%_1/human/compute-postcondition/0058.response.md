Postcondition: ***`k` is 0, `i` is the second element in the list, `arr` is a list containing two or more elements: 0, 1, 2, ..., 29 if `k0` is odd, otherwise it contains only 1, 2, ..., 29, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `k0` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains t-4 lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, `c` is equal to `n`, `ans` is a list containing two elements `k0` - sum(ans) and 1 << i, `l1` is a list containing two integers `n` and `k`. If `c` is equal to `n - 1`, then `ans` is a list containing three elements `k0` - sum(ans), `k0` - sum(ans), and 1 << i.***
