The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and list `arr`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr`.  If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the `i` is the third element in the list.
State: **`k` is 0, `i` is the third element in the list, `arr` is a list containing three or more elements: 0, 1, 2, ..., 29 if `k0` is odd, otherwise it contains only 1, 2, ..., 29, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `k0` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-4` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, `c` is equal to `n`, `ans` is a list containing two elements `k0 - sum(ans)` and 1 << `i`, `l1` is a list containing two integers `n` and `k`. If `c` is equal to `n - 1`, then `ans` is a list containing three elements `k0 - sum(ans)`, `k0 - sum(ans)`, and 1 << `i`.**
