Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: k is 0, i is 0, arr is an empty list, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, _ is 2, stdin contains t-6 lines, each containing two integers n and k, c is equal to n, ans is a list containing n elements, where the last element is k0 - sum(ans) and the rest are 1 << i for each i in the original list, l1 is a list containing two integers n and k, and the length of ans is now equal to n, and the elements of the list ans are being printed
Code of the loop:
while k:
    if k & 1 == 1:
        arr.append(i)
    k = k >> 1
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: k is k0 divided by 2, i is 1, arr is a list, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, _ is 2, stdin contains t-6 lines, each containing two integers n and k, c is equal to n, ans is a list containing n elements, where the last element is k0 - sum(ans) and the rest are 1 << i for each i in the original list, l1 is a list containing two integers n and k, and the length of ans is now equal to n, and the elements of the list ans are being printed. If k is odd, arr contains one element 0. Otherwise, arr is an empty list.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: k is k0 divided by 4, i is 2, arr is a list containing one element 1 if k0 divided by 2 is odd, otherwise it is an empty list, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, _ is 2, stdin contains t-6 lines, each containing two integers n and k, c is equal to n, ans is a list containing n elements, where the last element is k0 - sum(ans) and the rest are 1 << i for each i in the original list, l1 is a list containing two integers n and k, and the length of ans is now equal to n, and the elements of the list ans are being printed.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: k is k0 divided by 8, i is 3, arr is a list containing one element 1 if k0 divided by 2 is odd, otherwise it is an empty list. If k0 divided by 8 is odd, arr is a list containing two elements: 1 and 2 if k0 divided by 2 is odd, otherwise it is a list containing one element 2. n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, _ is 2, stdin contains t-6 lines, each containing two integers n and k, c is equal to n, ans is a list containing n elements, where the last element is k0 - sum(ans) and the rest are 1 << i for each i in the original list, l1 is a list containing two integers n and k, and the length of ans is now equal to n, and the elements of the list ans are being printed.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
