Output State: **`k` is not 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list containing one element 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `k0` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, `c` is equal to `n`, and `ans` is a list containing `n` elements equal to 1 << `i`, and the elements of the list `ans` are being printed, `l1` is a list containing two integers `n` and `k`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^9. The current value of `k` is odd.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` is appended to the list `arr`, which now contains one element, 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The list `arr` now contains one element, which is 0. The rest of the variables retain their initial values.
