Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9 divided by 4 and k is greater than 0, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, i is 2, _ is 0, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing two integers n and k. If k is odd, arr is a list containing two elements, which are 0 and 1. If k is even, arr is a list containing one element, which is 1.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `k` and `i`. The first line performs a bitwise right shift operation on `k`, effectively dividing it by 2. Since `k` is initially an integer between 1 and 10^9 divided by 2 and greater than 0, after the division, `k` becomes an integer between 1 and 10^9 divided by 4 and greater than 0. The second line increments `i` by 1, making it 2. The values of `n`, `k0`, and `_` remain unchanged. The state of `arr` depends on the parity of `k`, which is updated according to the new value of `k`. The state of stdin remains the same, containing t-2 lines, each with two integers `n` and `k`.
