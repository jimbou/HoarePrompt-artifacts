Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 divided by 2 and `k` is greater than 0, `k0` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `i` is 1, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`. If `k` is odd, `arr` is a list containing two elements, which are 0 and 1. If `k` is even, `arr` is a list containing one element, which is 1.**
