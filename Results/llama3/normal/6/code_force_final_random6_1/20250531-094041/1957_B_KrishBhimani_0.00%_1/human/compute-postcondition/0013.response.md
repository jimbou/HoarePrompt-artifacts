Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 divided by 4 and `k` is greater than 0 and `k` is not equal to 0, `k0` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `i` is 2, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`. If `k` is odd, `arr` is a list containing three elements, which are 0, 1, and 2. If `k` is even, `arr` is a list containing two elements, which are 1 and 2.***
