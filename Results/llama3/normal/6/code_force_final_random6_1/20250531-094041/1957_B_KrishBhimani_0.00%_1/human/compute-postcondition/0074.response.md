Output State: **k is k0 divided by 2, i is 1, arr is a list, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, _ is 2, stdin contains t-6 lines, each containing two integers n and k, c is equal to n, ans is a list containing n elements, where the last element is k0 - sum(ans) and the rest are 1 << i for each i in the original list, l1 is a list containing two integers n and k, and the length of ans is now equal to n, and the elements of the list ans are being printed. If k is odd, arr contains one element 0. Otherwise, arr is an empty list.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been divided by 2, and `i` has been incremented by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The list `arr` still contains either one element 0 (if `k` is odd) or is empty (if `k` is even). The length of the list `ans` is still equal to `n`, and its elements are being printed. The value of `c` is still equal to `n`, and the list `l1` still contains two integers `n` and `k`. The contents of `stdin` remain unchanged, containing `t-6` lines, each with two integers `n` and `k`.
