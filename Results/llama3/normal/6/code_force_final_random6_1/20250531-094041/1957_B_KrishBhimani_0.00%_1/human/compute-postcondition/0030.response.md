Output State: **k is 0, i is the last element in the list, arr is an empty list, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k, c is equal to n, and ans is a list containing n elements equal to 1 << i.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated over all the elements in the list `arr`, and the variable `i` is now pointing to the last element in the list. The list `arr` is now empty, and the variable `c` has reached the value of `n`. The list `ans` now contains `n` elements, each of which is equal to `1 << i`, where `i` is the index of the current element in the list `arr`. The other variables in the precondition remain unchanged.
