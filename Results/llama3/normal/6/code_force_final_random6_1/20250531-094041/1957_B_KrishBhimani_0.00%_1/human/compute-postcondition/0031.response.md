Output State: **`k` is 0, `i` is the last element in the list, `arr` is an empty list, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `k0` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, `c` is equal to `n`, and `ans` is a list containing `n` elements equal to 1 << i.**

The code adds `n - len(ans)` zeros to the end of the `ans` list. Since `ans` initially contains `n` elements equal to 1 << i, the length of `ans` is already equal to `n`. Therefore, `n - len(ans)` is 0, and no zeros are added to the `ans` list. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
