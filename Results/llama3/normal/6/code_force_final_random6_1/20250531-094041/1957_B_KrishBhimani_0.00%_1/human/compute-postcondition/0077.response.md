Postcondition: **`k` is k0 divided by 2 and k0 is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list containing one element 1 if k is odd, otherwise it is an empty list, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `k0` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains t-6 lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, `c` is equal to `n`, `ans` is a list containing `n` elements, where the last element is `k0` - sum(ans) and the rest are 1 << `i` for each `i` in the original list, `l1` is a list containing two integers `n` and `k`, and the length of `ans` is now equal to `n`, and the elements of the list `ans` are being printed.**
