Postcondition: ***k is 0, i is the second element in the list, arr is a list containing all the indices of the bits that are 1 in the binary representation of k0 that must have at least 2 elements, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k, c is equal to n, and ans is a list containing two elements equal to k0 - sum(ans) and 1 << i. If c is equal to n - 1, then ans is a list containing three elements equal to k0 - sum(ans), 1 << i, and k0 - sum(ans).***
