Output State: **k is 0, i is the last element in the list, arr is an empty list, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, _ is 2, stdin contains t-6 lines, each containing two integers n and k, c is equal to n, ans is a list containing n elements which are k0 - sum(ans) and 1 << i for all i in arr, l1 is a list containing two integers n and k.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: the loop has finished executing, the list of indices of bits that are 1 in the binary representation of k0 is empty, the counter c is equal to n, and the list ans contains n elements, where the first element is k0 minus the sum of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are powers of 2 corresponding to the indices in the list arr.
