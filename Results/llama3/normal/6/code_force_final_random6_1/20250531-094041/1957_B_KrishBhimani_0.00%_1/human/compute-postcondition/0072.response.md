Output State: **`k` is an odd number not equal to 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list containing one element 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `k0` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-6` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, `c` is equal to `n`, `ans` is a list containing `n` elements, where the last element is `k0 - sum(ans)` and the rest are `1 << i` for each `i` in the original list, `l1` is a list containing two integers `n` and `k`, and the length of `ans` is now equal to `n`, and the elements of the list `ans` are being printed.**

The code appends the value of `i` to the list `arr`. Since `i` is 0, the list `arr` now contains one element, which is 0. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains `t-6` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`. The list `ans` is still being printed.
