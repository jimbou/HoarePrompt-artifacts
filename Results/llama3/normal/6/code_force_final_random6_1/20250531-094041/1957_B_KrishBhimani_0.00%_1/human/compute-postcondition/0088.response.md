Postcondition: ***k is 0, i is the first element in the list, arr is a list containing the indices of the bits that are 1 in the binary representation of k0 that must have at least 1 element, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, _ is 2, stdin contains t-7 lines, each containing two integers n and k, c is equal to n-1, ans is a list containing one element which is k0 - sum(ans), l1 is a list containing two integers n and k. If c is not equal to n-1, the program state remains unchanged.***
