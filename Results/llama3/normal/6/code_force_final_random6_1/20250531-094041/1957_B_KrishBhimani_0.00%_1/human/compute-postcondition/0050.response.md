Output State: **k is 0, i is an integer between 1 and 30, arr is a list containing one or more elements: 0, 1, 2, ..., 29 if k0 is odd, otherwise it contains only 1, 2, ..., 29, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, _ is 1, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers n and k, c is 0, ans is an empty list, l1 is a list containing two integers n and k.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line initializes an empty list `ans`. The second line assigns the value 0 to `c`. 

The first line affects the variable `ans`, which was previously a list containing `n` elements equal to 1 << 29. After the execution of the first line, `ans` becomes an empty list. 

The second line affects the variable `c`, which was previously equal to `n`. After the execution of the second line, `c` becomes 0. 

No other variables are affected by the code snippet. The values of `k`, `i`, `arr`, `n`, `k0`, `_`, `stdin`, and `l1` remain unchanged.
