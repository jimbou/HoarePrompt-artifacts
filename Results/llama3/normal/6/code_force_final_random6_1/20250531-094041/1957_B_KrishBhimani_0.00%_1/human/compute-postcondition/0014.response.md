Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is an integer between 1/2 and 10^9/4 and k is greater than 0 and k is not equal to 0, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, i is 3, _ is 0, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing two integers n and k. If k is odd, arr is a list containing three elements, which are 0, 1, and 2. If k is even, arr is a list containing two elements, which are 1 and 2.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `k` and `i`. The first line performs a bitwise right shift operation on `k`, effectively dividing it by 2. This means that the new value of `k` will be between 1/2 and 10^9/4. The second line increments the value of `i` by 1, making it 3. The remaining variables, including `n`, `k0`, `_`, and the contents of `stdin`, are not affected by the code. The value of `arr` depends on the parity of `k`, which is now modified. If the new value of `k` is odd, `arr` will contain three elements: 0, 1, and 2. If the new value of `k` is even, `arr` will contain two elements: 1 and 2.
