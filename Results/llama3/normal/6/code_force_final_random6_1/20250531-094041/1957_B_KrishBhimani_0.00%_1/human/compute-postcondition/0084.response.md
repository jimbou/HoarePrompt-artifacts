Output State: **k is 0, i is equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of k0, arr is a list containing the indices of the bits that are 1 in the binary representation of k0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, _ is 2, stdin contains t-6 lines, each containing two integers n and k, c is 0, ans is an empty list, l1 is a list containing two integers n and k.**

The code snippet provided consists of two lines: `ans = []` and `c = 0`. The first line reassigns the variable `ans` to an empty list, effectively clearing its previous contents. The second line sets the value of `c` to 0, overwriting its previous value which was equal to `n`. 

All other variables (`k`, `i`, `arr`, `n`, `k0`, `_`, `l1`, and the contents of `stdin`) remain unchanged as they are not directly modified by the provided code snippet.
