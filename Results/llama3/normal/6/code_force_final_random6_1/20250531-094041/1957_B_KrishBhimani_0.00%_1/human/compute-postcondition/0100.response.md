The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the `ans` list.

Since `ans` is a list containing `n` elements, where each element is either `k0 - sum(ans)` or `1 << i` for all `i` in `arr`, and `arr` is an empty list, all elements in `ans` will be `k0 - sum(ans)`.

However, since `k0 - sum(ans)` is a single value and `ans` has `n` elements, this means that all elements in `ans` will be the same value, which is `k0 - sum(ans)`.

But `sum(ans)` is the sum of all elements in `ans`, which are all equal to `k0 - sum(ans)`. This creates a circular dependency, and we cannot determine the exact value of `k0 - sum(ans)` without knowing the value of `sum(ans)`.

Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, the length of `ans` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5.

Therefore, the `print(*ans)` statement will print `n` identical values, where each value is `k0 - sum(ans)`, but the exact value of `k0 - sum(ans)` cannot be determined.

Output: **[k0 - sum(ans)] * n (where k0 - sum(ans) is the value of k0 minus the sum of all elements in ans, and n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5)**
