Output State: **k is an integer between 1 and 10^9, i is 2, arr is a list containing one or two elements: 0 and 1 if k is odd, otherwise it contains only 1, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, _ is 1, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers n and k, c is equal to n, ans is a list containing n elements equal to 1 << 1, l1 is a list containing two integers n and k, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line performs a bitwise right shift operation on the value of `k`, effectively dividing it by 2. Since `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, the result of this operation will also be an integer between 1 and 10^9. The second line increments the value of `i` by 1, making it 2. No other variables are affected by these operations.
