The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and arr, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `arr`. If `i` is less than the length of `arr`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the second element in the list, `arr` has at least 2 elements. So for the loop to be executed one more time the `arr` must have at least 3 elements and the `i` is the third element in the list.
State: **k is 0, i is the third element in the list, arr is a list containing the indices of the bits that are 1 in the binary representation of k0 that must have at least 3 elements, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, _ is 2, stdin contains t-9 lines, each containing two integers n and k, c is equal to n, ans is a list containing three elements which are k0 - sum(ans), 1 << i and 1 << i, l1 is a list containing two integers n and k**
