To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for i in arr:`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

* `k` is 0
* `i` is the second element in the list
* `arr` is a list containing all the indices of the bits that are 1 in the binary representation of `k0` that must have at least 2 elements
* `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5
* `k0` is an integer between 1 and 10^9
* `_` is 0
* `stdin` contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`
* `c` is equal to `n`
* `ans` is a list containing two elements equal to `k0 - sum(ans)` and `1 << i`. If `c` is equal to `n - 1`, then `ans` is a list containing three elements equal to `k0 - sum(ans)`, `1 << i`, and `k0 - sum(ans)`

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `arr`.

Since `i` is the second element in the list, for the loop to execute again, `i` should be the next element in the list. Therefore, `i` should be the third element in the list.

The list `arr` must have at least 3 elements for the loop to execute again. Therefore, `arr` should be a list containing all the indices of the bits that are 1 in the binary representation of `k0` that must have at least 3 elements.

The other variables (`k`, `n`, `k0`, `_`, `stdin`, `c`, and `ans`) are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`k` is 0, `i` is the third element in the list, `arr` is a list containing all the indices of the bits that are 1 in the binary representation of `k0` that must have at least 3 elements, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `k0` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, `c` is equal to `n`, and `ans` is a list containing two elements equal to `k0 - sum(ans)` and `1 << i`. If `c` is equal to `n - 1`, then `ans` is a list containing three elements equal to `k0 - sum(ans)`, `1 << i`, and `k0 - sum(ans)`**
