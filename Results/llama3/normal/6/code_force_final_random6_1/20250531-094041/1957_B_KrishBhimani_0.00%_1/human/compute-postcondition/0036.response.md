To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to examine the loop condition, which is `while k:`. This means the loop will continue as long as `k` is not zero.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `k` is 0,
- Other variables' states are irrelevant to the loop condition.

Since `k` needs to be non-zero for the loop to execute at least once, we need to adjust the state of `k`.

State: **`k` is not 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `k0` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, `c` is equal to `n`, and `ans` is a list containing `n` elements equal to 1 << `i`, and the elements of the list `ans` are being printed, `l1` is a list containing two integers `n` and `k`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^9**
