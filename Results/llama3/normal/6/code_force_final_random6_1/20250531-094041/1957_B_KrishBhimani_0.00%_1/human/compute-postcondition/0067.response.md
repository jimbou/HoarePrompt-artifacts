The code prints the elements of the list `ans`. The list `ans` contains `n` elements, where the last element is `k0 - sum(ans)` and the rest are `1 << i` for each `i` in the original list. Since the exact values of `n`, `k0`, and the original list are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the elements in `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the elements of the list `ans`.

Output: **`k` is 0, `i` is the last element in the list, `arr` is an empty list, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `k0` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `_` is 1, stdin contains t-4 lines, each containing two integers n and k, `c` is equal to n, `ans` is a list containing n elements, where the last element is k0 - sum(ans) and the rest are 1 << i for each i in the original list, `l1` is a list containing two integers n and k, and the length of `ans` is now equal to `n`, and the elements of the list `ans` are being printed**
