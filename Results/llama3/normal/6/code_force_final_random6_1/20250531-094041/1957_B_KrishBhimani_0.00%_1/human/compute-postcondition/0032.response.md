The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the `ans` list.

Since `ans` is a list containing `n` elements equal to 1 << i, and `i` is the last element in the list `arr`, which is an empty list, `i` is not defined. However, based on the structure of the problem, it seems that `i` is intended to be an index, and since `arr` is empty, `i` is likely 0.

Therefore, each element in the `ans` list is equal to 1 << 0, which is 1.

So, the `print(*ans)` statement will print `n` number of 1's.

Output: **1 1 1 ... 1 (n times)**
