Output State: **k is 0, i is 0, arr is an empty list, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, _ is 1, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers n and k, c is equal to n, and ans is a list containing n elements equal to 1 << i, and the elements of the list ans are being printed, l1 is a list containing two integers n and k, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9.**

The code executes as follows: 

- The first line reads a line from stdin and splits it into a list of strings, which is assigned to `l1`. Since stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, `l1` will contain two strings representing the next pair of integers. This reduces the number of lines in stdin to t-3.

- The second line maps the strings in `l1` to integers and unpacks them into `n` and `k`. This overwrites the initial values of `n` and `k`. The new value of `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, and the new value of `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^9.

- The third line initializes an empty list `arr`.

- The fourth line assigns the value of `k` to `k0`. Since `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `k0` also becomes an integer between 1 and 10^9.

- The fifth line sets `i` to 0.

The final state includes the updated values of `n`, `k`, `k0`, `i`, and `l1`, as well as the unchanged values of `k`, `_`, `c`, and `ans`.
