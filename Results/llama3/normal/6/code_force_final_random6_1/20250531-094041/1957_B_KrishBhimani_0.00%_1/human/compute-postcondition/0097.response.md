Output State: **k is 0, i is the third element in the list, arr is a list containing the indices of the bits that are 1 in the binary representation of k0 that must have at least 3 elements, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, _ is 2, stdin contains t-10 lines, each containing two integers n and k, c is equal to n, ans is a list containing four elements which are k0 - sum(ans), 1 << i, 1 << i and 1 << i, l1 is a list containing two integers n and k.**

In this output state, the value of c has been incremented by 1, and the list ans has been appended with the value 1 << i. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin now contains t-10 lines, each containing two integers n and k.
