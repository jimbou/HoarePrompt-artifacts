Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 divided by 2 and `k` is greater than 0, if `k` is odd, `arr` is a list containing two elements, which are 0 and 1, otherwise `arr` is a list containing one element, which is 1, `k0` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `i` is 1, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`.**

In this output state, the value of `arr` has been updated based on the initial state. If `k` is odd, `arr` now contains two elements, 0 and 1. If `k` is even, `arr` now contains one element, which is 1. The values of the other variables remain the same.
