Postcondition: ***`k` is 0, `i` is the third element in the list, `arr` is a list containing all the indices of the bits that are 1 in the binary representation of `k0` that must have at least 3 elements, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `k0` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, `c` is equal to `n`. If `c` is equal to `n - 1`, then `ans` is a list containing three elements equal to `k0 - sum(ans)`, `1 << i`, and `k0 - sum(ans)`. Otherwise, `ans` is a list containing two elements equal to `k0 - sum(ans)` and `1 << i`.***
