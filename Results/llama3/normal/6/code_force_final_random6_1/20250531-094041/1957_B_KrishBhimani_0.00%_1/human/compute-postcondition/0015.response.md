Output State: **k is 0, i is equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of k0, arr is a list containing all the indices of the bits that are 1 in the binary representation of k0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the value of k will be 0, the value of i will be equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of k0, and the list arr will contain all the indices of the bits that are 1 in the binary representation of k0. The values of n, k0, and _ will remain unchanged. The stdin will contain t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k.
