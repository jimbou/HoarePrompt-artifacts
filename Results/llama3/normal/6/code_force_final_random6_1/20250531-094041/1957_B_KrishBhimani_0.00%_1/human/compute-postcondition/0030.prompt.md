Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: k is 0, i is equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of k0, arr is a list containing all the indices of the bits that are 1 in the binary representation of k0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k, ans is an empty list, c is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in arr:
    if c == n - 1:
        ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))
        break
    c += 1
    ans.append(1 << i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: k is 0, i is the first element in the list, arr is a list containing all the indices of the bits that are 1 in the binary representation of k0 that must have at least 1 element, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k, c is equal to n, and ans is a list containing two elements equal to k0 - sum(ans) and 1 << i

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: k is 0, i is the second element in the list, arr is a list containing all the indices of the bits that are 1 in the binary representation of k0 that must have at least 2 elements, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k, c is equal to n, and ans is a list containing two elements equal to k0 - sum(ans) and 1 << i. If c is equal to n - 1, then ans is a list containing three elements equal to k0 - sum(ans), 1 << i, and k0 - sum(ans).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: k is 0, i is the third element in the list, arr is a list containing all the indices of the bits that are 1 in the binary representation of k0 that must have at least 3 elements, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k, c is equal to n + 1, ans is a list containing one element equal to 1 << i. If c is equal to n - 1, then ans is a list containing three elements equal to k0 - sum(ans), 1 << i, and k0 - sum(ans). Otherwise, ans is a list containing two elements equal to k0 - sum(ans) and 1 << i.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
