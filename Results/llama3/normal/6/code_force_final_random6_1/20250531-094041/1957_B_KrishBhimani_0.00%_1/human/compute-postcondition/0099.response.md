Output State: **`k` is 0, `i` is the last element in the list, `arr` is an empty list, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `k0` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains t-6 lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, `c` is equal to `n`, `ans` is a list containing `n` elements which are `k0 - sum(ans)` and 1 << `i` for all `i` in `arr`, `l1` is a list containing two integers `n` and `k`. The length of `ans` is now equal to `n`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `k` is still 0, `i` is still the last element in the list, `arr` is still an empty list, `n` is still an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `k0` is still an integer between 1 and 10^9, `_` is still 2, `stdin` still contains t-6 lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, `c` is still equal to `n`, `ans` is now a list containing `n` elements which are `k0 - sum(ans)` and 1 << `i` for all `i` in `arr`, and `l1` is still a list containing two integers `n` and `k`. The length of `ans` has been updated to be equal to `n` by adding zeros to the end of the list.
