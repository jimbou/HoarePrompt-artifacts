Output State: **`k` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list containing one, two or three elements: 0, 1 and 2 if k is odd, otherwise it contains only 1 and 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `k0` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `_` is 1, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers n and k, `c` is equal to `n`, `ans` is a list containing `n` elements equal to 1 << 1, `l1` is a list containing two integers `n` and `k`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 and `k` must be greater than 0**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` is appended to the list `arr`. The list `arr` now contains one, two or three elements: 0, 1 and 2 if `k` is odd, otherwise it contains only 1 and 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
