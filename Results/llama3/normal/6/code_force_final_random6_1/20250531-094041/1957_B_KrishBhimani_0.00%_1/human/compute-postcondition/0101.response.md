The code prints the elements of the list `ans` which contains `n` elements. Each element in `ans` is either `k0 - sum(ans)` or 1 << `i` for all `i` in `arr`. Since `arr` is an empty list, all elements in `ans` are `k0 - sum(ans)`. The length of `ans` is equal to `n`, which is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5.

Output: ** `k` is 0, `i` is the last element in the list, `arr` is an empty list, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `k0` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains t-6 lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, `c` is equal to `n`, `ans` is a list containing `n` elements which are `k0 - sum(ans)` and 1 << `i` for all `i` in `arr`, `l1` is a list containing two integers `n` and `k`. The length of `ans` is now equal to `n`, and the elements of `ans` which are all `k0 - sum(ans)` are being printed**
