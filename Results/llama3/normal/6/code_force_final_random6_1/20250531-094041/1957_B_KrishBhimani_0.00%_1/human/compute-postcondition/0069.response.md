Output State: **k is 0, i is 0, arr is an empty list, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, _ is 2, stdin contains t-6 lines, each containing two integers n and k, c is equal to n, ans is a list containing n elements, where the last element is k0 - sum(ans) and the rest are 1 << i for each i in the original list, l1 is a list containing two integers n and k, and the length of ans is now equal to n, and the elements of the list ans are being printed**

In this output state, the values of `k`, `i`, `arr`, `_`, and `c` remain unchanged. The value of `n` is updated to be an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, and the value of `k0` is updated to be an integer between 1 and 10^9. The list `l1` now contains two integers `n` and `k`. The list `ans` still contains `n` elements, where the last element is `k0 - sum(ans)` and the rest are `1 << i` for each `i` in the original list. The length of `ans` is now equal to `n`, and the elements of the list `ans` are being printed. Stdin now contains `t-6` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`.
