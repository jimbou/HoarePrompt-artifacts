Output State: **k is 0, i is an integer between 1 and 30, arr is a list containing one or more elements: 0, 1, 2, ..., 29 if k0 is odd, otherwise it contains only 1, 2, ..., 29, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, _ is 1, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers n and k, c is equal to n, ans is a list containing n elements equal to 1 << 29, l1 is a list containing two integers n and k, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

- The variable k is 0.
- The variable i is an integer between 1 and 30.
- The variable arr is a list containing one or more elements: 0, 1, 2, ..., 29 if k0 is odd, otherwise it contains only 1, 2, ..., 29.
- The variable n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5.
- The variable k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9.
- The variable _ is 1.
- The variable stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers n and k.
- The variable c is equal to n.
- The variable ans is a list containing n elements equal to 1 << 29.
- The variable l1 is a list containing two integers n and k.
- The variable n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5.
- The variable k is an integer between 1 and 10^9.
