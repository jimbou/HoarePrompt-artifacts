Output State: **stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9, arr is an empty list, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, i is 0, _ is 0**

The first line reads the first line from stdin, which contains an integer t, and splits it into a list of strings. The second line converts the first two elements of this list into integers and assigns them to n and k, respectively. The third line initializes an empty list arr. The fourth line assigns the value of k to k0. The fifth line initializes a variable i to 0. The sixth line does not affect any variables.
