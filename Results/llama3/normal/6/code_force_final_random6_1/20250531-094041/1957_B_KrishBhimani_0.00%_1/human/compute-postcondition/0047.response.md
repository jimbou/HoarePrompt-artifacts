Postcondition: ***k is an integer between 1 and 10^9, i is 2, arr is a list containing one or two elements: 0 and 1 if k is odd, otherwise it contains only 1, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, _ is 1, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers n and k, c is equal to n, ans is a list containing n elements equal to 1 << 1, l1 is a list containing two integers n and k, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9 and k must be greater than 0. If k is odd, arr will contain one, two or three elements: 0, 1 and 2. Otherwise, arr will contain only 1 and 2.***
