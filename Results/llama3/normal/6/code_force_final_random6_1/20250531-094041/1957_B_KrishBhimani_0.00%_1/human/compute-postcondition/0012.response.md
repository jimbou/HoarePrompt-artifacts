Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 divided by 4 and `k` is greater than 0 and `k` is not equal to 0, `k0` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `i` is 2, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`. If `k` is odd, `arr` is a list containing three elements, which are 0, 1, and 2. If `k` is even, `arr` is a list containing two elements, which are 1 and 2.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `k0`, `i`, and `_` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is in the list `arr`. If `k` is odd, `arr` now contains three elements: 0, 1, and 2. If `k` is even, `arr` now contains two elements: 1 and 2. The stdin still contains t-2 lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`.
