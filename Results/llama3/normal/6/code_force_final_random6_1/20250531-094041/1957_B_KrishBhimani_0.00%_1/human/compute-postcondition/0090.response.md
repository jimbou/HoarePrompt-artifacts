To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for i in arr:`, which means we can only adjust the state of `i` and `arr`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the first element in the list `arr`, and `arr` is a list containing the indices of the bits that are 1 in the binary representation of `k0` that must have at least 1 element.

For the loop to execute again, `arr` must have at least one more element, and `i` must be the next element in the list.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`k` is 0, `i` is the second element in the list, `arr` is a list containing the indices of the bits that are 1 in the binary representation of `k0` that must have at least 2 elements, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `k0` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains t-8 lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, `c` is equal to `n`, `ans` is a list containing two elements which are `k0 - sum(ans)` and 1 << i, `l1` is a list containing two integers `n` and `k**
