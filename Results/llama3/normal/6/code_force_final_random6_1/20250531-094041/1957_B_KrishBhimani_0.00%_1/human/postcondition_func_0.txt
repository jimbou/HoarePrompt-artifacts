The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers, n and k. For each test case, it generates a list of n elements, where the first n-1 elements are powers of 2 corresponding to the binary representation of k, and the last element is the difference between k and the sum of the previous elements. The function then prints this list. The function repeats this process for all test cases, until the input is exhausted.
