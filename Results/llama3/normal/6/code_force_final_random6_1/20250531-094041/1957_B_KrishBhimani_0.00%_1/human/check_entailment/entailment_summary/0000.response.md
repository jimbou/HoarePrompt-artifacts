Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence of n non-negative integers.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of n and k.
3. It then generates a list of powers of 2 corresponding to the binary representation of k. This is done by iterating over the bits of k from least significant to most significant and appending the corresponding power of 2 to the list if the bit is 1.
4. The program then constructs the final sequence by taking the first n-1 elements from the list of powers of 2 and appending the difference between k and the sum of these elements as the last element.
5. Finally, the program prints the constructed sequence.

The program's logic is correct because it ensures that the sum of the sequence is equal to k and maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.

Correctness: **True**
