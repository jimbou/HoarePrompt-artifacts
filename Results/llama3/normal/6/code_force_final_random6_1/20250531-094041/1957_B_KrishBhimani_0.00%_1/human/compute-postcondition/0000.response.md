The only objects in the loop head are variables  `_` and `input()`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `input()`.  If the `input()` is at least 1 the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= k <= 10^9). So for the loop to be executed  the `input()` must be at least 1 and `_` is 0.
