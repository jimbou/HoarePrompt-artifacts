The only variable in the loop head is variable k, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable k.  If k is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9, So for the loop to be executed one more time k must be greater than 0.
State: **k is an integer between 1 and 10^9, i is 2, arr is a list containing one or two elements: 0 and 1 if k is odd, otherwise it contains only 1, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, _ is 1, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers n and k, c is equal to n, ans is a list containing n elements equal to 1 << 1, l1 is a list containing two integers n and k, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9 and k must be greater than 0**
