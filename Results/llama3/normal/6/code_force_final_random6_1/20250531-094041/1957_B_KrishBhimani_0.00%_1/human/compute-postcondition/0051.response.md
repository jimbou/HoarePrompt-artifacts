The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `arr`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `arr`. If the list has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, k is 0, i is an integer between 1 and 30, arr is a list containing one or more elements: 0, 1, 2, ..., 29 if k0 is odd, otherwise it contains only 1, 2, ..., 29, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, _ is 1, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers n and k, c is 0, ans is an empty list, l1 is a list containing two integers n and k. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 element and the i is the first element in the list.
State: **`k` is 0, `i` is the first element in the list, `arr` is a list containing one or more elements: 0, 1, 2, ..., 29 if k0 is odd, otherwise it contains only 1, 2, ..., 29, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `k0` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `_` is 1, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers n and k, `c` is 0, `ans` is an empty list, `l1` is a list containing two integers n and k**
