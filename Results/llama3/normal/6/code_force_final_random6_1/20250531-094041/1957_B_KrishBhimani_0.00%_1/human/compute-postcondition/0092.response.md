Postcondition: ***k is 0, i is the second element in the list, arr is a list containing the indices of the bits that are 1 in the binary representation of k0 that must have at least 2 elements, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, _ is 2, stdin contains t-8 lines, each containing two integers n and k, c is equal to n, ans is a list containing two elements which are k0 - sum(ans) and 1 << i, l1 is a list containing two integers n and k. If c is equal to n - 1, ans is updated to a list containing three elements which are k0 - sum(ans), 1 << i and k0 - sum(ans), otherwise no changes are made.***
