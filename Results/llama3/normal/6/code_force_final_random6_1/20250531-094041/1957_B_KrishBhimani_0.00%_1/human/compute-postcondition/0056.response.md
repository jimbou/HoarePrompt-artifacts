The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and arr, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `arr`. If `i` is less than the length of `arr`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first element in the list, `arr` is a list containing one or more elements: 0, 1, 2, ..., 29 if k0 is odd, otherwise it contains only 1, 2, ..., 29. So for the loop to be executed one more time the `i` is the second element in the list and `arr` is a list containing two or more elements: 0, 1, 2, ..., 29 if k0 is odd, otherwise it contains only 1, 2, ..., 29.
State: **`k` is 0, `i` is the second element in the list, `arr` is a list containing two or more elements: 0, 1, 2, ..., 29 if k0 is odd, otherwise it contains only 1, 2, ..., 29, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `k0` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains t-4 lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, `c` is equal to `n`, `ans` is a list containing two elements `k0` - sum(ans) and 1 << i, `l1` is a list containing two integers `n` and `k**
