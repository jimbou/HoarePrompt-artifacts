According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `arr`. If `arr` has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, k is 0, i is equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of k0, arr is a list containing the indices of the bits that are 1 in the binary representation of k0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, _ is 2, stdin contains t-6 lines, each containing two integers n and k, c is 0, ans is an empty list, l1 is a list containing two integers n and k. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 element and the i is the first element in the list.
State: **k is 0, i is the first element in the list, arr is a list containing the indices of the bits that are 1 in the binary representation of k0 that must have at least 1 element, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, _ is 2, stdin contains t-6 lines, each containing two integers n and k, c is 0, ans is an empty list, l1 is a list containing two integers n and k**
