Output State: **k is 0, i is the third element in the list, arr is a list containing three or more elements: 0, 1, 2, ..., 29 if k0 is odd, otherwise it contains only 1, 2, ..., 29, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, _ is 1, stdin contains t-4 lines, each containing two integers n and k, c is equal to n, ans is a list containing three elements k0 - sum(ans), 1 << i, and 1 << i if c is equal to n - 1, otherwise it contains three elements k0 - sum(ans), k0 - sum(ans), and 1 << i, l1 is a list containing two integers n and k.**

The code increments the value of `c` by 1, making it equal to `n`. Then, it appends the value of `1 << i` to the list `ans`. If `c` is equal to `n - 1`, `ans` will contain three elements: `k0 - sum(ans)`, `1 << i`, and `1 << i`. Otherwise, `ans` will contain three elements: `k0 - sum(ans)`, `k0 - sum(ans)`, and `1 << i`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
