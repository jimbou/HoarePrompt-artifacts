To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the list `arr`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more elements in the list `arr`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the first element in the list, and `arr` has at least 1 element.

For the loop to execute again, `i` should be the next element in the list, and `arr` should have at least 2 elements.

State: **`k` is 0, `i` is the second element in the list, `arr` is a list containing all the indices of the bits that are 1 in the binary representation of k0 that must have at least 2 elements, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `k0` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k, `c` is equal to n, and `ans` is a list containing two elements equal to k0 - sum(ans) and 1 << i**
