The code prints the elements of the list `ans`, which contains `n` elements equal to 1 shifted left by `i` places, where `i` is the last element in the list `arr` (which is empty), and `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5.
Output: ** `k` is 0, `i` is the last element in the list, `arr` is an empty list, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `k0` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, `c` is equal to `n`, and `ans` is a list containing `n` elements equal to 1 << i, and the elements of the list `ans` are being printed**
