Output State: **`k` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list containing one or two elements: 0 and 1 if `k` is odd, otherwise it contains only 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `k0` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `_` is 1, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, `c` is equal to `n`, `ans` is a list containing `n` elements equal to 1 << 1, `l1` is a list containing two integers `n` and `k`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^9**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` is appended to the list `arr`. If `k` is odd, `arr` now contains two elements: 0 and 1. If `k` is even, `arr` now contains only one element: 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
