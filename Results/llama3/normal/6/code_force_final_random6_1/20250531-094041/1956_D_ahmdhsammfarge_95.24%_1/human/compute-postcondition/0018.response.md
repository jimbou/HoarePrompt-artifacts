Output State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 2 elements, `j` is 2, `i` is 1, `r` is 0, `over_sum` is the sum of all elements in `lst`, `l` is either 0 or the index of the last element in `lst` that maximizes the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first `l` elements plus `(len(lst) - l), `sm` is equal to `lst[0]` + `lst[3:]` + 9**.

In this output state, `sm` is calculated by summing the first `i` elements of `lst` (which is just `lst[0]` since `i` is 1), summing all elements in `lst` except the first `j+1` elements (which is `lst[3:]` since `j` is 2), and adding the square of the difference between `j` and `i` plus 1 (which is 9 since `j` is 2 and `i` is 1). The other variables remain unchanged.
