Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

print(sum(lst), len(ops))
for r in ops:
    print(*r)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of non-negative integers.
    r = l = 0
    over_sum = sum(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):
            sm = sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2
            if sm > over_sum:
                r, l = [i, j]
                over_sum = sm
        
    #State: lst is a list of non-negative integers, j is len(lst), i is len(lst), r is the index of the first element in lst that maximizes the sum of all elements in lst except the first r elements plus (len(lst) - r), over_sum is the maximum sum of all elements in lst except the first r elements plus (len(lst) - r), l is the index of the last element in lst that maximizes the sum of all elements in lst except the first l elements plus (len(lst) - l).
    return r, l
    #The program returns two values: r and l. r is the index of the first element in lst that maximizes the sum of all elements in lst except the first r elements plus (len(lst) - r), and l is the index of the last element in lst that maximizes the sum of all elements in lst except the first l elements plus (len(lst) - l). Both r and l are indices in the list lst, which contains non-negative integers.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of non-negative integers as input and returns two indices, r and l, which represent the start and end positions of a sub-list that maximizes the sum of all elements in the list except the first r elements plus (len(lst) - r) and the last l elements plus (len(lst) - l), respectively. The function iterates through all possible sub-lists, calculates the sum of the remaining elements plus the square of the sub-list length, and updates the indices r and l whenever a larger sum is found. The function returns the indices r and l, which correspond to the sub-list that achieves the maximum sum.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: r and l are integers such that r >= l >= 0, and ops is a list that can be modified.
    if (r == l) :
        ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
        return
        #The program returns nothing because there is no return statement in the given code snippet. The state of the variables remains the same: `r` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `l` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `r` equals `l`, and `ops` is a list that contains a new element `[r + 1, l + 1]`.
    #State: *r and l are integers such that r > l >= 0, and ops is a list that can be modified.
    func_2(r, l - 1, ops)
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    func_2(r, l - 1, ops)

#Overall this is what the function does:This function modifies the input list `ops` by appending a new element `[r + 1, l + 1]` when `r` equals `l`, and recursively calls itself with modified parameters `r` and `l - 1` when `r` is greater than `l`. The function does not return any value.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: r and l are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= l, lst is a list of non-negative integers, and ops is a list of lists of integers.
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    if (min(lst[r:l + 1]) == 0) :
        ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    #State: *`r` and `l` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= l, `lst` is a list of non-negative integers, `ops` is a list of lists of integers where the last two lists are `[r + 1, l + 1]`. The minimum value of the sublist of `lst` from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) is either 0 or greater than 0.
    ops.append([r + 1, r + 1])
    func_2(r, l, ops)
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    n = l - r + 1
    lst[r:l + 1] = [n for _ in range(n)]
    return lst
    #The program returns a list of non-negative integers where the sublist from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) is replaced with a list of `n` elements, all equal to `n`, where `n` is equal to `l - r + 1`, and the minimum value of the sublist of `lst` from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) is `n`.

#Overall this is what the function does:Replaces a sublist of a given list with a new list of equal elements, where the value of the elements is equal to the length of the sublist, and updates a list of operations.
