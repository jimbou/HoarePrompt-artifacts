Functionality: **This function takes a list of non-negative integers as input and returns two indices, r and l, which represent the start and end positions of a sub-list that maximizes the sum of all elements in the list except the first r elements plus (len(lst) - r) and the last l elements plus (len(lst) - l), respectively. The function iterates through all possible sub-lists, calculates the sum of the remaining elements plus the square of the sub-list length, and updates the indices r and l whenever a larger sum is found. The function returns the indices r and l, which correspond to the sub-list that achieves the maximum sum.**
