The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `len(lst)`. If `i` is less than `len(lst)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `len(lst)` is `j` which is equal to `len(lst)`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1.
State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers, `j` is `len(lst)`, `i` is 2, `r` is either 1 or the index of the first element in `lst` that maximizes the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first `r` elements plus `(len(lst) - r)`, `over_sum` is the maximum sum of all elements in `lst` except the first `r` elements plus `(len(lst) - r)`, `l` is either 0 or the index of the last element in `lst` that maximizes the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first `l` elements plus `(len(lst) - l)`**
