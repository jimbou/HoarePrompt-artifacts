Output State: **`r` and `l` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= l, `lst` is a list of non-negative integers where the sublist from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) is replaced with a list of `n` elements, all equal to `n`, where `n` is equal to `l - r + 1`, `ops` is a list of lists of integers where the last three lists are `[r + 1, r + 1]`, `[r + 1, l + 1]`, and the minimum value of the sublist of `lst` from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) is `n`.**

In this output state, the values of `r` and `l` remain unchanged, but the sublist of `lst` from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) is replaced with a list of `n` elements, all equal to `n`, where `n` is equal to `l - r + 1`. The list `ops` is updated with two new sublists: `[r + 1, r + 1]` and `[r + 1, l + 1]`. The minimum value of the sublist of `lst` from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) is now `n`, which is greater than 0.
