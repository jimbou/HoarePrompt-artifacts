Output State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers, `j` is `len(lst)`, `i` is 0, `r` is 0, `over_sum` is the sum of all elements in `lst`, `l` is either 0 or the index of the last element in `lst` that maximizes the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first `l` elements plus `(len(lst) - l) ** 2`, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first `l` elements plus `(len(lst) - l) ** 2`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the loop has iterated over the entire list, and the variables `j` and `i` have reached their final values. The variable `r` remains 0, and `over_sum` remains the sum of all elements in the list. The variable `l` is either 0 or the index of the last element in the list that maximizes the sum of all elements in the list except the first `l` elements plus `(len(lst) - l) ** 2`. The variable `sm` is the sum of all elements in the list except the first `l` elements plus `(len(lst) - l) ** 2`.
