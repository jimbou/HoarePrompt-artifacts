Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of elements in an array by performing a specific operation. The operation involves choosing two integers `l` and `r` such that `1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n`, computing `x` as the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the set `{a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r}`, and simultaneously setting `a_l := x, a_{l+1} := x, ..., a_r := x`.

The program consists of three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`.

`func_1` takes a list `lst` as input and returns the indices `r` and `l` that maximize the sum of the elements in the list. It does this by iterating over all possible pairs of indices and computing the sum of the elements outside the range `[i, j]` plus the square of the length of the range. If the computed sum is greater than the current maximum sum, it updates the maximum sum and the corresponding indices.

`func_2` takes indices `r` and `l` and a list `ops` as input. It is a recursive function that generates a sequence of operations to transform the list `lst` into a list with all elements equal to `l - r + 1`. The function works by recursively calling itself with `l - 1` and then appending the operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the list `ops`.

`func_3` takes indices `r` and `l`, a list `lst`, and a list `ops` as input. It generates a sequence of operations to transform the list `lst` into a list with all elements equal to `l - r + 1`. The function first appends the operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the list `ops`. If the minimum element in the range `[r, l]` is 0, it appends another operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the list `ops`. Then, it appends the operation `[r + 1, r + 1]` to the list `ops` and calls `func_2` to generate the remaining operations. Finally, it updates the list `lst` by setting all elements in the range `[r, l]` to `l - r + 1`.

The main part of the program reads the input, calls `func_1` to find the indices `r` and `l` that maximize the sum, calls `func_3` to generate the sequence of operations, and prints the maximum sum and the sequence of operations.

Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the algorithm to maximize the sum of elements in the array by performing the specified operation. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` work together to find the optimal indices and generate the sequence of operations to achieve the maximum sum. The program also correctly handles the case where the minimum element in the range `[r, l]` is 0.
