Output State: **lst is a list of non-negative integers with at least 3 elements, j is 3, i is 2, r is 2, l is 3, over_sum is the sum of the first 2 elements of lst plus the sum of all elements in lst except the first 3 elements plus 5, and sm is the sum of the first 2 elements of lst plus the sum of all elements in lst except the first 3 elements plus 5.**

The code assigns the value of `i` to `r` and the value of `j` to `l`, making `r` equal to 2 and `l` equal to 3. The second line assigns the value of `sm` to `over_sum`, making `over_sum` equal to the sum of the first 2 elements of `lst` plus the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first 3 elements plus 5. No other variables are affected.
