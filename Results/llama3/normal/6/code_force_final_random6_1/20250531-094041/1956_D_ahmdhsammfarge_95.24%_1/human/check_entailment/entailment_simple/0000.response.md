Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of elements in an array by performing a specific operation. The operation involves choosing two integers `l` and `r` such that `1 <= l <= r <= n`, computing `x` as the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the set `{a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r}`, and simultaneously setting `a_l := x, a_{l+1} := x, ..., a_r := x`.

The program uses a recursive approach to find the maximum sum of elements in the array. It first defines a function `func_1` that finds the indices `r` and `l` that maximize the sum of elements in the array except the first `r` elements plus `(len(lst) - r)`. It then uses a while loop to repeatedly apply the operation to the array until no more operations can be performed.

The program also defines two other functions, `func_2` and `func_3`, which are used to perform the operation on the array. `func_2` is a recursive function that performs the operation on a sublist of the array, and `func_3` performs the operation on the entire array.

The program also includes a try-except block to handle the case where the array does not contain any zeros. In this case, the program simply prints the sum of the elements in the array and the number of operations performed.

Based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments, the program appears to be correct. It correctly implements the operation and uses a recursive approach to find the maximum sum of elements in the array. The program also handles the case where the array does not contain any zeros.

Correctness: **True**
