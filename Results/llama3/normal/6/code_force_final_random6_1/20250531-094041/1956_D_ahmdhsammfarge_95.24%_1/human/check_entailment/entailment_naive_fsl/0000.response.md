Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the way the program handles the operation of setting all elements in a subarray to the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the subarray.

In the `func_3` function, the program first appends the operation to set all elements in the subarray to the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the subarray. However, it then appends another operation to set the first element of the subarray to the length of the subarray, which is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the input `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. The program will first find the optimal subarray to operate on, which is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. It will then append the operation to set all elements in this subarray to `0`, which is the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the subarray. However, it will then append another operation to set the first element of the subarray to `4`, which is not necessary and will lead to an incorrect result.

To fix this issue, the program should only append the operation to set all elements in the subarray to the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the subarray, without appending the additional operation to set the first element of the subarray to the length of the subarray.
