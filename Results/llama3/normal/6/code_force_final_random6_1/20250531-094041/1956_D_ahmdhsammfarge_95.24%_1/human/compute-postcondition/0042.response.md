Output State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 5 elements, `j` is 5, `i` is 2, `sm` is the sum of the first 2 elements of `lst` plus the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first 5 elements plus 16, `r` is either 2 or has not been changed, `l` is either 5 or has not been changed.**

In this output state, the value of `sm` has been updated to be the sum of the first 2 elements of `lst` plus the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first 5 elements plus 16. The values of `j` and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `r` and `l` depend on the previous value of `sm` and `over_sum`, but since the initial state does not provide the value of `over_sum`, we cannot determine the exact values of `r` and `l`.
