Output State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 3 elements, `j` is 2, `i` is 0, `r` is 0, `over_sum` is the sum of all elements in `lst`, `l` is either 0 or 1, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first two elements plus 1**.

In this output state, the value of `sm` is calculated by summing all elements in `lst` except the first two elements (since `i` is 0 and `j` is 2) and adding 1 (which is the result of `(j - i + 1) ** 2` when `j` is 2 and `i` is 0). The value of `l` remains either 0 or 1, depending on the condition in the initial state. The other variables remain unchanged.
