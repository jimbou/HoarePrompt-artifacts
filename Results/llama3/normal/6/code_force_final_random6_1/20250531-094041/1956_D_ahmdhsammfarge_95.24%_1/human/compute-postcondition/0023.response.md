Output State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 3 elements, `j` is 3, `i` is 1, `over_sum` is the sum of all elements in `lst`, `l` is either 0 or the index of the last element in `lst` that maximizes the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first `l` elements plus `(len(lst) - l), `sm` is equal to `lst[0]` + `lst[3:]` + 9, `r` is either 1 or retains its original value, `l` is either 2 or retains its original value, `sm` is now equal to `lst[0]` + `lst[4:]` + 4.**

In this output state, the value of `sm` has been updated to `lst[0]` + `lst[4:]` + 4, which is the sum of the first `i` elements of `lst`, the sum of the elements of `lst` starting from index `j + 1`, and the square of the difference between `j` and `i` plus 1. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
