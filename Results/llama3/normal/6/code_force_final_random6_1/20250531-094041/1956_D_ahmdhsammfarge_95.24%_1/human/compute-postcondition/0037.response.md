The only variables in the loop head are variables `j`, `i`, and `lst`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `i`, and `lst`. If `j` is less than `len(lst)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3, `i` is 2, and `lst` has at least 3 elements. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 4, and `len(lst)` must be greater than 4.

State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 4 elements, `j` is 4, `i` is 2. If the sum of the first 2 elements of `lst` plus the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first 3 elements plus 5 is greater than the maximum sum of all elements in `lst` except the first `r` elements plus `(len(lst) - r)`, then `r` is 2, `l` is 3, `over_sum` is the sum of the first 2 elements of `lst` plus the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first 3 elements plus 5, and `sm` is the sum of the first 2 elements of `lst` plus the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first 3 elements plus 5. Otherwise, `r` is either 1 or the index of the first element in `lst` that maximizes the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first `r` elements plus `(len(lst) - r)`, `over_sum` is the maximum sum of all elements in `lst` except the first `r` elements plus `(len(lst) - r)`, `l` is either 0 or the index of the last element in `lst` that maximizes the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first `l` elements plus `(len(lst) - l)`, and `sm` is the sum of the first 2 elements of `lst` plus the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first 3 elements plus 5.**
