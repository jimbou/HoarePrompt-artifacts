Output State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 3 elements, `j` is 3, `i` is 2, `r` is either 1 or the index of the first element in `lst` that maximizes the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first `r` elements plus `(len(lst) - r)`, `over_sum` is the maximum sum of all elements in `lst` except the first `r` elements plus `(len(lst) - r)`, `l` is either 0 or the index of the last element in `lst` that maximizes the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first `l` elements plus `(len(lst) - l)`, `sm` is the sum of the first 2 elements of `lst` plus the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first 3 elements plus 5**.

In this output state, the variable `sm` is assigned the sum of the first 2 elements of `lst` plus the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first 3 elements plus 5. The values of the other variables are not affected.
