Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `lst` is a list of non-negative integers, `j` is `len(lst)`, `i` is 2, `r` is either 1 or the index of the first element in `lst` that maximizes the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first `r` elements plus `(len(lst) - r)`, `over_sum` is the maximum sum of all elements in `lst` except the first `r` elements plus `(len(lst) - r)`, `l` is either 0 or the index of the last element in `lst` that maximizes the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first `l` elements plus `(len(lst) - l)`
Code of the loop:
for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):
    sm = sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2
    if sm > over_sum:
        r, l = [i, j]
        over_sum = sm


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`lst` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 3 elements, `j` is 3, `i` is 2. If the sum of the first 2 elements of `lst` plus the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first 3 elements plus 5 is greater than the maximum sum of all elements in `lst` except the first `r` elements plus `(len(lst) - r)`, then `r` is 2, `l` is 3, `over_sum` is the sum of the first 2 elements of `lst` plus the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first 3 elements plus 5, and `sm` is the sum of the first 2 elements of `lst` plus the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first 3 elements plus 5. Otherwise, `r` is either 1 or the index of the first element in `lst` that maximizes the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first `r` elements plus `(len(lst) - r)`, `over_sum` is the maximum sum of all elements in `lst` except the first `r` elements plus `(len(lst) - r)`, `l` is either 0 or the index of the last element in `lst` that maximizes the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first `l` elements plus `(len(lst) - l)`, and `sm` is the sum of the first 2 elements of `lst` plus the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first 3 elements plus 5.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`lst` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 4 elements, `j` is 4, `i` is 2, `sm` is the sum of the first 2 elements of `lst` plus the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first 4 elements plus 9. If `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, then `r` is 2 and `l` is 4. Otherwise, no changes are made to `r` and `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *lst is a list of non-negative integers with at least 5 elements, j is 5, i is 2, sm is the sum of the first 2 elements of lst plus the sum of all elements in lst except the first 5 elements plus 16. If sm is greater than over_sum, then r is 2 and l is 5. Otherwise, r is either 2 or has not been changed and l is either 5 or has not been changed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
