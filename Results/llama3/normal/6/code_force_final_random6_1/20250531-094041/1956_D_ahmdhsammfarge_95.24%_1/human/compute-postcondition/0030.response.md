Output State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers, `j` is `len(lst)`, `i` is 1, `r` is either 1 or the index of the first element in `lst` that maximizes the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first `r` elements plus `(len(lst) - r)`, `over_sum` is the maximum sum of all elements in `lst` except the first `r` elements plus `(len(lst) - r)`, `l` is either 0 or the index of the last element in `lst` that maximizes the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first `l` elements plus `(len(lst) - l)`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that the list `lst` remains unchanged, `j` becomes equal to the length of `lst`, `i` remains 1, and `r` and `l` are updated to be the indices of the first and last elements in `lst` that maximize the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first `r` or `l` elements plus `(len(lst) - r)` or `(len(lst) - l)`, respectively. The `over_sum` variable is updated to be the maximum sum of all elements in `lst` except the first `r` elements plus `(len(lst) - r)`.
