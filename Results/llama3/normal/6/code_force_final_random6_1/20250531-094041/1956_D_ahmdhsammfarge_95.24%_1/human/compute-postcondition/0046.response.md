Output State: **lst is a list of non-negative integers, j is len(lst), i is len(lst), r is the index of the first element in lst that maximizes the sum of all elements in lst except the first r elements plus (len(lst) - r), over_sum is the maximum sum of all elements in lst except the first r elements plus (len(lst) - r), l is the index of the last element in lst that maximizes the sum of all elements in lst except the first l elements plus (len(lst) - l).**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the list `lst` remains unchanged, and the indices `i` and `j` have reached the end of the list. The variables `r` and `l` have been updated to the indices of the first and last elements in `lst` that maximize the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first `r` elements plus `(len(lst) - r)`, and the maximum sum `over_sum` has been updated accordingly.
