Output State: **The program returns two values: r and l. r is the index of the first element in lst that maximizes the sum of all elements in lst except the first r elements plus (len(lst) - r), and l is the index of the last element in lst that maximizes the sum of all elements in lst except the first l elements plus (len(lst) - l). Both r and l are indices in the list lst, which contains non-negative integers.**
