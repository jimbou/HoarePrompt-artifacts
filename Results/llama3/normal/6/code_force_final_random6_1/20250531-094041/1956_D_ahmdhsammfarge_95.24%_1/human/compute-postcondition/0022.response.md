The only variables in the loop head are variables  j, i and lst, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `i` and `lst`. If `j` is less than `len(lst)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, `i` is 1, `lst` has at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute again `j` must be increased by 1 so `j` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `lst` must have at least 3 elements.
State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 3 elements, `j` is 3, `i` is 1, `over_sum` is the sum of all elements in `lst`, `l` is either 0 or the index of the last element in `lst` that maximizes the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first `l` elements plus `(len(lst) - l), `sm` is equal to `lst[0]` + `lst[3:]` + 9. If `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, then `r` is 1 and `l` is 2. Otherwise, `r` and `l` retain their original values.**
