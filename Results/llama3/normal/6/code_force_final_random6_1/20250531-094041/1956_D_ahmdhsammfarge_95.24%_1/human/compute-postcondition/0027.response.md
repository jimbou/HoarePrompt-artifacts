Output State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 4 elements, `j` is 4, `i` is 1, `over_sum` is equal to `lst[0]` + `lst[4:]` + 4, `l` is either 0 or the index of the last element in `lst` that maximizes the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first `l` elements plus (`len(lst)` - `l`), `r` is either 1 or its original value, `sm` is equal to `lst[0]` + `lst[5:]` + 16.**

In this output state, the value of `sm` has been updated to `lst[0]` + `lst[5:]` + 16, which is the sum of the first `i` elements of `lst`, the elements of `lst` after index `j`, and the square of the difference between `j` and `i` plus 1. The other variables retain their original values.
