Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 3 elements, `j` is 3, `i` is 0, `r` is 0, `over_sum` is the sum of all elements in `lst`, `l` is either 0 or 1, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first three elements plus 10. If `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, then `l` is set to 1. Otherwise, `l` remains unchanged.***
