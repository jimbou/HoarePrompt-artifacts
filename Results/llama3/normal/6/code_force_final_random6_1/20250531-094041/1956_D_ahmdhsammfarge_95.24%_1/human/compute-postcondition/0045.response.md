Output State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers, `j` is `len(lst)`, `i` is 2, `r` is the index of the first element in `lst` that maximizes the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first `r` elements plus `(len(lst) - r)`, `over_sum` is the maximum sum of all elements in `lst` except the first `r` elements plus `(len(lst) - r)`, `l` is the index of the last element in `lst` that maximizes the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first `l` elements plus `(len(lst) - l)`.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `j` is equal to the length of the list `lst`, `i` remains 2, and `r`, `over_sum`, and `l` are updated to their maximum values based on the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first `r` elements plus `(len(lst) - r)`. The list `lst` remains unchanged.
