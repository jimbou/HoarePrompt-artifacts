Functionality: This function takes a list of non-negative integers as input and returns two indices, r and l, which represent the start and end positions of the sublist that maximizes the sum of all elements in the list except the first r elements plus (len(lst) - r) and the first l elements plus (len(lst) - l), respectively. The function iterates through the list to find the optimal positions that result in the maximum sum, and returns these positions as indices in the original list.
