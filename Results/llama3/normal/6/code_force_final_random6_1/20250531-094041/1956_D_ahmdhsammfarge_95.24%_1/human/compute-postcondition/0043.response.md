Output State: **lst is a list of non-negative integers with at least 5 elements, j is 5, i is 2, sm is the sum of the first 2 elements of lst plus the sum of all elements in lst except the first 5 elements plus 16, r is 2, l is 5, over_sum is the sum of the first 2 elements of lst plus the sum of all elements in lst except the first 5 elements plus 16.**

The code assigns the values of `i` and `j` to `r` and `l`, respectively, and assigns the value of `sm` to `over_sum`. The values of `lst`, `j`, `i`, and `sm` remain unchanged. The values of `r` and `l` are updated to 2 and 5, respectively. The value of `over_sum` is set to the same value as `sm`.
