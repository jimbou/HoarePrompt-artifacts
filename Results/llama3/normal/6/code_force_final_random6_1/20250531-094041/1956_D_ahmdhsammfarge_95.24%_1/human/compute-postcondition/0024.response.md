Output State: **lst is a list of non-negative integers with at least 3 elements, j is 3, i is 1, over_sum is equal to lst[0] + lst[4:] + 4, l is either 0 or the index of the last element in lst that maximizes the sum of all elements in lst except the first l elements plus (len(lst) - l), sm is equal to lst[0] + lst[4:] + 4, r is 1, l is 2.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The list `lst` remains unchanged, still containing non-negative integers with at least 3 elements. The variables `j` and `i` retain their original values, 3 and 1, respectively. The variable `over_sum` now holds the value of `sm`, which is equal to the sum of the first element of `lst`, all elements in `lst` starting from the 5th index, and 4. The variable `l` still has two possible values: either 0 or the index of the last element in `lst` that maximizes the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first `l` elements plus the length of `lst` minus `l`. The variable `sm` also retains its updated value, equal to the sum of the first element of `lst`, all elements in `lst` starting from the 5th index, and 4. Finally, the variables `r` and `l` have been reassigned to 1 and 2, respectively.
