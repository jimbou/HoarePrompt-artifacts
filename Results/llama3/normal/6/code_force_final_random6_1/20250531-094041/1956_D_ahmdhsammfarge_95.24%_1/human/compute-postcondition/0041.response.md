State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 5 elements, `j` is 5, `i` is 2, `sm` is the sum of the first 2 elements of `lst` plus the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first 5 elements plus 9. If `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, then `r` is 2 and `l` is 5. Otherwise, no changes are made to `r` and `l`.**
