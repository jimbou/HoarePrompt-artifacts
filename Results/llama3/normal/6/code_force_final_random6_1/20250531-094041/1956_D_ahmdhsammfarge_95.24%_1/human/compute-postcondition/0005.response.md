Output State: **The program returns a list of non-negative integers where the sublist from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) is replaced with a list of `n` elements, all equal to `n`, where `n` is equal to `l - r + 1`, and the minimum value of the sublist of `lst` from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) is `n`.**
