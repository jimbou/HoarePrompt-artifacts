Output State: **lst is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 3 elements, j is 2, i is 0, r is 0, over_sum is the sum of all elements in lst except the first two elements plus 1, l is 1, sm is the sum of all elements in lst except the first two elements plus 1**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the values of `i` and `j` to `r` and `l`, respectively. Since `i` is 0 and `j` is 2, `r` becomes 0 and `l` becomes 1. The second line assigns the value of `sm` to `over_sum`. Since `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first two elements plus 1, `over_sum` becomes the same value.

The final state includes all the variables from the initial state, with the values of `r` and `l` updated according to the assignments in the code. The value of `over_sum` is also updated to match the value of `sm`. The values of `lst`, `j`, `i`, and `sm` remain unchanged.
