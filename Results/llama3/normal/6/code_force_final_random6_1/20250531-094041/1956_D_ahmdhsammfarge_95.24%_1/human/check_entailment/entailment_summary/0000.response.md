Reasoning: 
The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of elements in an array by performing a specific operation. The operation involves choosing two integers l and r, computing the MEX (minimum excluded value) of the subarray from l to r, and setting all elements in the subarray to the MEX value.

The program consists of three functions: func_1, func_2, and func_3. func_1 finds the subarray that maximizes the sum of all elements in the list except the first r elements plus (len(lst) - r) and the last l elements plus (len(lst) - l), respectively. func_2 is a recursive function that modifies the input list ops by appending new elements. func_3 replaces a sublist of a given list with a new list of equal elements, where the value of the elements is equal to the length of the sublist, and updates a list of operations.

The program uses a while loop to repeatedly apply the operation to the subarray found by func_1 until no more operations can be performed. It then tries to find any remaining zeros in the list and sets them to 1. Finally, it prints the maximum sum of elements and the number of operations performed.

Based on the provided execution summaries, the program appears to be correct. func_1 correctly finds the subarray that maximizes the sum, func_2 correctly modifies the input list ops, and func_3 correctly replaces the sublist with a new list of equal elements and updates the list of operations. The while loop and try-except block also appear to be correctly implemented.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
