Output State: **lst is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 3 elements, j is 3, i is 0, r is 0, over_sum is the sum of all elements in lst except the first three elements plus 10, l is 1, sm is the sum of all elements in lst except the first three elements plus 10.**

In this output state, the value of `r` and `l` has been swapped, with `r` now being 0 and `l` being 1. The value of `over_sum` has been updated to be equal to `sm`, which is the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first three elements plus 10. The values of `lst`, `j`, `i`, and `sm` remain unchanged.
