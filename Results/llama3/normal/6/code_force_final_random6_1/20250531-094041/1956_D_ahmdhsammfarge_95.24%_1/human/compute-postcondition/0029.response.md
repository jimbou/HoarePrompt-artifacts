Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 4 elements, `j` is 4, `i` is 1. If `sm` > `over_sum`, then `over_sum` is equal to `lst[0]` + `lst[5:]` + 16, `l` is either 0 or the index of the last element in `lst` that maximizes the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first `l` elements plus (`len(lst)` - `l`), and `r` is 1. Otherwise, the values of `over_sum`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged.***
