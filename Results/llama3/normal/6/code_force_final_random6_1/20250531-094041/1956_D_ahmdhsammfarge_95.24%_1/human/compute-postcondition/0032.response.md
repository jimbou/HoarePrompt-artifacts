To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `j`, `i`, and `len(lst)`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `len(lst)` is greater than `i + 1`. Since `i` is 2, `len(lst)` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute.

We can adjust the state of `j` to be `i + 1`, which is 3.

The states of `lst`, `r`, `over_sum`, and `l` do not affect the execution of the loop, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 3 elements, `j` is 3, `i` is 2, `r` is either 1 or the index of the first element in `lst` that maximizes the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first `r` elements plus `(len(lst) - r)`, `over_sum` is the maximum sum of all elements in `lst` except the first `r` elements plus `(len(lst) - r)`, `l` is either 0 or the index of the last element in `lst` that maximizes the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first `l` elements plus `(len(lst) - l)`**
