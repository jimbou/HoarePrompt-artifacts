The only variables in the loop head are variables  j, i and lst, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `i` and `lst`. If `j` is less than `len(lst)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3, `i` is 1, `lst` has at least 3 elements. For the loop to execute again `j` must be increased by 1 so `j` is 4 and for the loop to execute again `lst` must have at least 4 elements.
State: **lst is a list of non-negative integers with at least 4 elements, j is 4, i is 1, over_sum is equal to lst[0] + lst[4:] + 4, l is either 0 or the index of the last element in lst that maximizes the sum of all elements in lst except the first l elements plus (len(lst) - l), sm is equal to lst[0] + lst[4:] + 4. If sm > over_sum, then r is 1 and l is 2. Otherwise, r and l retain their original values.**
