Postcondition: ***`r` and `l` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= l, `lst` is a list of non-negative integers, `ops` is a list of lists of integers where the last two lists are `[r + 1, l + 1]`. The minimum value of the sublist of `lst` from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) is either 0 or greater than 0.***
