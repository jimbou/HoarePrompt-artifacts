State: **lst is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 3 elements, j is 3, i is 0, r is 0, over_sum is the sum of all elements in lst, l is either 0 or 1, sm is the sum of all elements in lst except the first three elements plus 1. If the sum of all elements in lst except the first three elements plus 1 is greater than the sum of all elements in lst, then l is set to 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
