To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `j`, `i`, and `len(lst)`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `i + 1` is less than `len(lst)`. This means that `len(lst)` must be at least `i + 1`. Since `i` is 1, `len(lst)` must be at least 2.

Additionally, `j` is initialized to `i + 1`, which is 2.

The other variables, `lst`, `r`, `over_sum`, and `l`, are not directly related to the loop execution and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 2 elements, `j` is 2, `i` is 1, `r` is 0, `over_sum` is the sum of all elements in `lst`, `l` is either 0 or the index of the last element in `lst` that maximizes the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first `l` elements plus `(len(lst) - l)**
