Postcondition: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 2 elements, `j` is 2, `i` is 1, `r` is 0, `over_sum` is the sum of all elements in `lst`, `l` is either 0 or the index of the last element in `lst` that maximizes the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first `l` elements plus `(len(lst) - l), `sm` is equal to `lst[0]` + `lst[3:]` + 9, and the current value of `sm` is greater than the current value of `over_sum`.**
