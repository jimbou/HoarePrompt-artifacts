Output State: **lst is a list of non-negative integers with at least 4 elements, j is 4, i is 1, over_sum is equal to lst[0] + lst[5:] + 16, l is either 0 or the index of the last element in lst that maximizes the sum of all elements in lst except the first l elements plus (len(lst) - l), r is 1, sm is equal to lst[0] + lst[5:] + 16.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the values of `i` and `j` to `r` and `l`, respectively. Since `i` is 1 and `j` is 4, `r` becomes 1 and `l` becomes 4. The second line assigns the value of `sm` to `over_sum`. Since `sm` is equal to `lst[0]` + `lst[5:]` + 16, `over_sum` becomes equal to `lst[0]` + `lst[5:]` + 16.

Note that the values of `lst`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code snippet. The value of `sm` is also unchanged, as it is only used to assign a value to `over_sum`, but its own value is not modified.
