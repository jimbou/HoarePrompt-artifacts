State: **lst is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 3 elements, j is 2, i is 0, r is 0, and over_sum is the sum of all elements in lst. If the sum of all elements in lst except the first two elements plus 4 is greater than the sum of all elements in lst, then l is 1 and sm is the sum of all elements in lst except the first two elements plus 4. Otherwise, l remains 0.**
