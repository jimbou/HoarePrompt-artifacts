Postcondition: ***lst is a list of non-negative integers with at least 5 elements, j is 5, i is 2, sm is the sum of the first 2 elements of lst plus the sum of all elements in lst except the first 5 elements plus 16. If sm is greater than over_sum, then r is 2 and l is 5. Otherwise, r is either 2 or has not been changed and l is either 5 or has not been changed.***
