Output State: **lst is a list of non-negative integers with at least 2 elements, j is 2, i is 1, r is 1, l is 2, over_sum is equal to lst[0] + lst[3:] + 9, and sm is equal to lst[0] + lst[3:] + 9.**

In this output state, the values of `lst`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged because they are not modified by the code. The value of `r` is updated to 1, and the value of `l` is updated to 2, as assigned by the first line of the code. The value of `over_sum` is updated to be equal to `sm`, which is `lst[0] + lst[3:] + 9`, as assigned by the second line of the code. The value of `sm` remains unchanged because it is not modified by the code.
