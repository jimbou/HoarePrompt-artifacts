Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 4 elements, `j` is 4, `i` is 2, `sm` is the sum of the first 2 elements of `lst` plus the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first 4 elements plus 9. If `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, then `r` is 2 and `l` is 4. Otherwise, no changes are made to `r` and `l`.***
