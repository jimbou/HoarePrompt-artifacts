Postcondition: ***lst is a list of non-negative integers with at least 3 elements, j is 3, i is 1, over_sum is equal to lst[0] + lst[4:] + 4, l is either 0 or the index of the last element in lst that maximizes the sum of all elements in lst except the first l elements plus (len(lst) - l), sm is equal to lst[0] + lst[4:] + 4. If sm > over_sum, then r is 1 and l is 2. Otherwise, r and l retain their original values.***
