Output State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 3 elements, `j` is 3, `i` is 0, `r` is 0, `over_sum` is the sum of all elements in `lst`, `l` is either 0 or 1, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first three elements plus 10.**

In this output state, the value of `sm` has been updated to be the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first three elements plus 10, which is calculated as `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
