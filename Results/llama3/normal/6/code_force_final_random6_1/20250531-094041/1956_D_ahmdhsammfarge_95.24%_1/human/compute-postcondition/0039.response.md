Output State: **lst is a list of non-negative integers with at least 4 elements, j is 4, i is 2, sm is the sum of the first 2 elements of lst plus the sum of all elements in lst except the first 4 elements plus 9, r is 2, l is 4, over_sum is the sum of the first 2 elements of lst plus the sum of all elements in lst except the first 4 elements plus 9.**

The code assigns the values of `i` and `j` to `r` and `l`, respectively, and assigns the value of `sm` to `over_sum`. The values of `lst`, `j`, `i`, and `sm` remain unchanged. The new variables `r`, `l`, and `over_sum` are introduced with their respective values.
