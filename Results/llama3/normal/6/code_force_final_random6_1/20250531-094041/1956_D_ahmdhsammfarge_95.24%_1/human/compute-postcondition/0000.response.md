Output State: **`r` and `l` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= l, `lst` is a list of non-negative integers, `ops` is a list of lists of integers where the last list is `[r + 1, l + 1]`.**

In this output state, the values of `r`, `l`, and `lst` remain unchanged. The list `ops` has been updated by appending a new list containing the values `r + 1` and `l + 1`. This new list is added to the end of the existing list `ops`.
