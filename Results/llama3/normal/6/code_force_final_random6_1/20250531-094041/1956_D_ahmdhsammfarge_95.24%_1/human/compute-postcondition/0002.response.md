Output State: **`r` and `l` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= l, `lst` is a list of non-negative integers, `ops` is a list of lists of integers where the last two lists are `[r + 1, l + 1]`. The current value of the minimum of the sublist of `lst` from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) is 0.**

In this output state, the values of `r`, `l`, and `lst` remain unchanged. The list `ops` has been updated by appending another list `[r + 1, l + 1]`, making the last two lists in `ops` identical. The minimum value of the sublist of `lst` from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) is still 0.
