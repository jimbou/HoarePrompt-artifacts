Output State: **data is a list of strings where each string represents an integer or a space-separated list of integers, index is 1 + 4 + 4n + 2n, t is a positive integer greater than 0 and equal to the integer value of the first string in data minus 2, results is a list containing the result of func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a) and the new result, n is an integer equal to the integer value of the string at index in data, k is an integer equal to the integer value of the string at index + 1 in data, PB is an integer equal to the integer value of the string at index + 2 in data, PS is an integer equal to the integer value of the string at index + 3 in data, p is a list of n integers equal to the integer values of the strings from index + 4 to index + 4 + n - 1 in data, a is a list of n integers equal to the integer values of the strings from index + 4 + n to index + 4 + 2n - 1 in data, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` have been updated based on the values extracted from the `data` list at the specified indices. The `results` list has been appended with the result of the `func_1` function call. The `index` variable has been incremented by `4 + 2n` to point to the next set of data in the `data` list. The `t` variable remains unchanged, and the `stdin` remains empty.
