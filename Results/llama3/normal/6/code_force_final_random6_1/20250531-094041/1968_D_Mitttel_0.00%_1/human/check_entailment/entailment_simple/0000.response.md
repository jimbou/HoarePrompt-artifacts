Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the "Permutation game" problem. The program correctly calculates the scores for both Bodya and Sasha by simulating their moves and summing up the values from the array `a` at their respective positions. The program also correctly handles the case where a cycle is detected in the permutation, by calculating the score for the remaining steps after the cycle is detected.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the rules of the game. The use of a dictionary to keep track of visited positions and detect cycles is efficient and effective. The program also correctly handles the case where the number of steps `k` is greater than the length of the permutation, by using the modulo operator to ensure that the index stays within the bounds of the permutation.

The program's output is also correct, as it prints the result of the game for each test case, which is either "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw", depending on the scores of the two players.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
