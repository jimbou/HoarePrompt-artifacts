This function calculates the total score by traversing a list of positions and accumulating scores from a corresponding list of non-negative integers. It starts at a given position and moves to the next position based on the list of positions. If it detects a cycle, it calculates the score for the cycle and adds it to the total score. The function returns the total score after traversing the list for a specified number of steps or detecting a cycle.
