The only object in the loop head is variable `result` and list `results`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results`. If the list has at least 1 result the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `data` is a list of strings where each string represents an integer or a space-separated list of integers, `index` is 1 + 4 + (t - 1)n + (t - 1)n, `t` is 0, `results` is a list containing the results of func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a) for all iterations, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `PB` is an integer, `PS` is an integer, `p` is a list of n integers, `a` is a list of n integers, `stdin` is empty. So for the loop to be executed the list must have at least 1 result and the result is the first result in the list.
State: **`data` is a list of strings where each string represents an integer or a space-separated list of integers, `index` is 1 + 4 + (t - 1)n + (t - 1)n, `t` is 0, `results` is a list containing the results of func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a) for all iterations that must have at least 1 result, `result` is the first result in the list, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `PB` is an integer, `PS` is an integer, `p` is a list of n integers, `a` is a list of n integers, `stdin` is empty**
