The only variable in the loop head is `cycle_length`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cycle_length`. If `cycle_length` is at least 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `cycle_length` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `cycle_length` must be at least 2.
State: **`start_pos` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of positive integers, `a` is a list of non-negative integers, `len(p)` = `len(a)` = `n`, where `n` is a positive integer, `score` is the sum of `a[current_pos - 1]` for each iteration, `current_pos` is the position where the cycle starts, `steps` is less than `k`, `visited` is a dictionary with entries: each position visited mapped to its corresponding step, `cycle_start` is not -1, `cycle_length` is at least 2, `cycle_score` is the sum of `a[cycle_pos - 1]` for each iteration, `cycle_pos` is `p[cycle_pos - 1]**
