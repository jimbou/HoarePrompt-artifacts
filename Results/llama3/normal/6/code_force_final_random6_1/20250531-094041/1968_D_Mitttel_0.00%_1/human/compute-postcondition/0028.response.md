To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(remainder_steps):`. The only object in the loop head is `remainder_steps`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `remainder_steps`. If `remainder_steps` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `remainder_steps` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `remainder_steps` must be decremented by 1.

State: **`start_pos` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of positive integers, `a` is a list of non-negative integers, `len(p)` = `len(a)` = `n`, where `n` is a positive integer, `score` is the sum of `a[current_pos - 1]` for each iteration plus `full_cycles` * `cycle_score` plus `a[current_pos - 1]`, `current_pos` is `p[current_pos - 1]`, `steps` is less than `k`, `visited` is a dictionary with entries: each position visited mapped to its corresponding step, `cycle_start` is not -1, `cycle_length` is equal to `cycle_length`, `cycle_score` is the sum of `a[cycle_pos - 1]` for each iteration plus `a[cycle_pos - 1]` plus `a[cycle_pos - 1]` plus ... plus `a[cycle_pos - 1]` (`cycle_length` times), `cycle_pos` is `p[p[p[p...[p[cycle_pos - 1] - 1] - 1] - 1] - 1] - 1] - 1] - 1] - 1] - 1 (cycle_length times), `remaining_steps` is 0, `full_cycles` is the integer division of `remaining_steps` by `cycle_length`, `remainder_steps` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1**
