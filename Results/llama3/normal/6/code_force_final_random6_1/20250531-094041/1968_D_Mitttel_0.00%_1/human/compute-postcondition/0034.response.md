Output State: **The program returns the score which is the sum of `a[current_pos - 1]` for each iteration, where `a` is a list of non-negative integers, `current_pos` is the last position visited, and the number of iterations is equal to `k` if no cycle is detected, or the number of iterations is equal to `full_cycles * cycle_length + remainder_steps` if a cycle is detected, where `full_cycles` is the integer division of `remaining_steps` by `cycle_length`, `cycle_length` is the length of the cycle, `remainder_steps` is the remainder of `remaining_steps` divided by `cycle_length`, and `remaining_steps` is `k` minus the number of steps taken before the cycle is detected.**
