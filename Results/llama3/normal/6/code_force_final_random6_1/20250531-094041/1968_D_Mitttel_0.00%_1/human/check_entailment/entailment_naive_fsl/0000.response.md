Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement. The `calculate_score` function correctly calculates the score for a given starting position by simulating the game for `k` turns, and the `func_1` function correctly compares the scores of Bodya and Sasha to determine the winner.

The program handles all possible cases, including:

* When Bodya and Sasha have the same score, it returns "Draw".
* When Bodya's score is higher, it returns "Bodya".
* When Sasha's score is higher, it returns "Sasha".

The program also correctly handles the case when the game lasts for `k` turns, where `k` is a large number. In this case, the program uses a cycle detection algorithm to avoid redundant calculations and efficiently calculate the score.

The program's use of a dictionary to keep track of visited positions and detect cycles is also correct and efficient.

Overall, the program accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all possible cases, making it correct.
