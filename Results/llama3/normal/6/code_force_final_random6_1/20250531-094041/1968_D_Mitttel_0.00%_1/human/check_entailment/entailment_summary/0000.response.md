Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the "Permutation game" based on the provided problem description. The `func_1` function compares the scores of 'Bodya' and 'Sasha' calculated by the `calculate_score` function and returns the winner as a string. The `calculate_score` function correctly calculates the total score by traversing the list of positions and accumulating scores from the corresponding list of non-negative integers, handling cycles and remaining steps appropriately. The `func_2` function reads input from standard input, processes it according to the `func_1` function, and prints the results.

Correctness: **True**
