Functionality: **Reads input from standard input, processes it according to the func_1 function, and prints the results. The input is expected to be a list of strings representing integers or space-separated lists of integers, which are then parsed into various variables (t, n, k, PB, PS, p, a) and passed to func_1. The function iterates over the input data, processing each set of variables and storing the results in a list. Finally, it prints each result in the list.**
