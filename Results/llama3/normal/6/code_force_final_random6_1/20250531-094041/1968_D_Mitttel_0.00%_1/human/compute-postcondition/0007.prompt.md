Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: data is a list of strings where each string represents an integer or a space-separated list of integers, index is 1, t is a positive integer equal to the integer value of the first string in data, results is an empty list, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    k = int(data[index + 1])
    PB = int(data[index + 2])
    PS = int(data[index + 3])
    index += 4
    p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    result = func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)
    results.append(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: data is a list of strings where each string represents an integer or a space-separated list of integers, index is 1 + 4 + n + n, t is a positive integer greater than 0 and equal to the integer value of the first string in data, results is a list containing the result of func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a), n is an integer, k is an integer, PB is an integer, PS is an integer, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n integers, stdin is empty

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: data is a list of strings where each string represents an integer or a space-separated list of integers, index is 1 + 4 + 2n + n, t is a positive integer greater than 1 and equal to the integer value of the first string in data minus 1, results is a list containing the result of func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a) and the new result, n is an integer, k is an integer, PB is an integer, PS is an integer, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n integers, stdin is empty

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: data is a list of strings where each string represents an integer or a space-separated list of integers, index is 1 + 4 + 4n + 2n, t is a positive integer greater than 0 and equal to the integer value of the first string in data minus 2, results is a list containing the result of func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a) and the new result, n is an integer equal to the integer value of the string at index in data, k is an integer equal to the integer value of the string at index + 1 in data, PB is an integer equal to the integer value of the string at index + 2 in data, PS is an integer equal to the integer value of the string at index + 3 in data, p is a list of n integers equal to the integer values of the strings from index + 4 to index + 4 + n - 1 in data, a is a list of n integers equal to the integer values of the strings from index + 4 + n to index + 4 + 2n - 1 in data, stdin is empty




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
