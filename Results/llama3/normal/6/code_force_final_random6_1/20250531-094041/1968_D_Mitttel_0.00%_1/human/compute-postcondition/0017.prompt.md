Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: data is a list of strings where each string represents an integer or a space-separated list of integers, index is 1 + 4 + (t - 1)n + (t - 1)n, t is 0, results is a list containing the results of func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a) for all iterations, n is an integer, k is an integer, PB is an integer, PS is an integer, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n integers, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `data` is a list of strings where each string represents an integer or a space-separated list of integers, `index` is 1 + 4 + (t - 1)n + (t - 1)n, `t` is 0, `results` is a list containing the results of func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a) for all iterations that must have at least 1 result, `result` is the first result in the list, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `PB` is an integer, `PS` is an integer, `p` is a list of n integers, `a` is a list of n integers, `stdin` is empty, and the first result in the list of results is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `data` is a list of strings where each string represents an integer or a space-separated list of integers, `index` is 1 + 4 + (t - 1)n + (t - 1)n, `t` is 0, `results` is a list containing the results of func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a) for all iterations that must have at least 2 results, `result` is the second result in the list, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `PB` is an integer, `PS` is an integer, `p` is a list of n integers, `a` is a list of n integers, `stdin` is empty, and the second result in the list of results is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `data` is a list of strings where each string represents an integer or a space-separated list of integers, `index` is 1 + 4 + (t - 1)n + (t - 1)n, `t` is 0, `results` is a list containing the results of func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a) for all iterations that must have at least 3 results, `result` is the third result in the list, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `PB` is an integer, `PS` is an integer, `p` is a list of n integers, `a` is a list of n integers, `stdin` is empty, and the third result in the list which is `result` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
