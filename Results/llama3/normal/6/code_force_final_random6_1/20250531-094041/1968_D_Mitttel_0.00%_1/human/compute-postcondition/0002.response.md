Output State: **data is a list of strings where each string represents an integer or a space-separated list of integers, index is 1 + 4 + n + n, t is a positive integer greater than 0 and equal to the integer value of the first string in data, results is a list containing the result of func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a), n is an integer, k is an integer, PB is an integer, PS is an integer, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n integers, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the initial state's information about `data`, `t`, and `stdin` remains valid. The `index` variable has been incremented by 4 (to account for the four `int` values extracted from `data`) and then by `n` twice (to account for the two lists of `n` integers extracted from `data`). The `results` list now contains the result of the `func_1` function call with the extracted values. The variables `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` have been assigned values based on the extracted integers and lists from `data`.
