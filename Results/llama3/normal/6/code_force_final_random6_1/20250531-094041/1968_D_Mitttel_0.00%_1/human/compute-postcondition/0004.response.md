Output State: **data is a list of strings where each string represents an integer or a space-separated list of integers, index is 1 + 4 + 2n + n, t is a positive integer greater than 1 and equal to the integer value of the first string in data minus 1, results is a list containing the result of func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a) and the new result, n is an integer, k is an integer, PB is an integer, PS is an integer, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n integers, stdin is empty**

The code block modifies the values of `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, `a`, `index`, and `results`. The initial values of `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` are replaced with new values extracted from the `data` list. The `index` is incremented by `4 + 2n` to point to the next set of data in the list. The `results` list is appended with the result of the function `func_1` called with the new values of `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`. The values of `data`, `t`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
