State: **start_pos is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, p is a list of positive integers, a is a list of non-negative integers, len(p) = len(a) = n, where n is a positive integer, score is the sum of a[current_pos - 1] for each iteration, current_pos is the position where the cycle starts, steps is less than k, visited is a dictionary with entries: each position visited mapped to its corresponding step, cycle_start is not -1, cycle_length is at least 3, cycle_score is the sum of a[cycle_pos - 1] for each iteration plus a[cycle_pos - 1], cycle_pos is p[p[cycle_pos - 1] - 1]**
