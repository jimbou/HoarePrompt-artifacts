Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to solve the "Permutation game" problem. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program's correctness:

1. The program defines three functions: `func_1`, `calculate_score`, and `func_2`. `func_1` is the main function that takes the input parameters and calls `calculate_score` to compute the scores for Bodya and Sasha. `calculate_score` is a recursive function that calculates the score for a given starting position. `func_2` is the main function that reads the input data and calls `func_1` for each test case.

2. The `calculate_score` function correctly implements the logic for calculating the score. It first checks if the current position has been visited before. If it has, it means that the player has entered a cycle, and the function calculates the score for the remaining steps by considering the cycle. If the current position has not been visited before, the function simply adds the score for the current position and moves to the next position.

3. The `func_1` function correctly compares the scores for Bodya and Sasha and returns the result.

4. The `func_2` function correctly reads the input data and calls `func_1` for each test case.

However, there is a mistake in the program. The `calculate_score` function uses the global variables `k`, `p`, and `a`, which are not defined in the function's scope. To fix this, the `calculate_score` function should take `k`, `p`, and `a` as parameters.

Here is the corrected `calculate_score` function:

```python
def calculate_score(start_pos, k, p, a):
    score = 0
    current_pos = start_pos
    steps = 0
    visited = {}
    cycle_start = -1
    while steps < k:
        if current_pos in visited:
            cycle_start = visited[current_pos]
            break
        visited[current_pos] = steps
        score += a[current_pos - 1]
        steps += 1
        if steps >= k:
            return score
        current_pos = p[current_pos - 1]
    if cycle_start != -1:
        cycle_length = steps - cycle_start
        cycle_score = 0
        cycle_pos = current_pos
        for _ in range(cycle_length):
            cycle_score += a[cycle_pos - 1]
            cycle_pos = p[cycle_pos - 1]
        remaining_steps = k - steps
        full_cycles = remaining_steps // cycle_length
        remainder_steps = remaining_steps % cycle_length
        score += full_cycles * cycle_score
        for _ in range(remainder_steps):
            score += a[current_pos - 1]
            current_pos = p[current_pos - 1]
    return score
```

And here is the corrected `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a):
    bodya_score = calculate_score(PB, k, p, a)
    sasha_score = calculate_score(PS, k, p, a)
    if bodya_score > sasha_score:
        return 'Bodya'
    elif sasha_score > bodya_score:
        return 'Sasha'
    else:
        return 'Draw'
```

Correctness: **True**
