Output State: **start_pos is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, p is a list of positive integers, a is a list of non-negative integers, len(p) = len(a) = n, where n is a positive integer, score is the sum of a[current_pos - 1] for each iteration plus full_cycles * cycle_score plus a[current_pos - 1] plus a[current_pos - 1], current_pos is p[p[current_pos - 1] - 1], steps is less than k, visited is a dictionary with entries: each position visited mapped to its corresponding step, cycle_start is not -1, cycle_length is equal to cycle_length, cycle_score is the sum of a[cycle_pos - 1] for each iteration plus a[cycle_pos - 1] plus a[cycle_pos - 1] plus ... plus a[cycle_pos - 1] (cycle_length times), cycle_pos is p[p[p[p...[p[cycle_pos - 1] - 1] - 1] - 1] - 1] - 1] - 1] - 1] - 1] - 1] - 1 (cycle_length times), remaining_steps is 0, full_cycles is the integer division of remaining_steps by cycle_length, remainder_steps is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, remainder_steps is decremented by 1, score is incremented by a[current_pos - 1], current_pos is updated to p[current_pos - 1]**
