To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects within it.

The loop head is `for result in results:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `result` and `results`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If the list has at least 3 results, the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `results` has at least 2 results, and `result` is the second result in the list.

For the loop to execute one more time, the list `results` must have at least 3 results, and `result` must be the third result in the list.

State: **`data` is a list of strings where each string represents an integer or a space-separated list of integers, `index` is 1 + 4 + (t - 1)n + (t - 1)n, `t` is 0, `results` is a list containing the results of func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a) for all iterations that must have at least 3 results, `result` is the third result in the list, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `PB` is an integer, `PS` is an integer, `p` is a list of n integers, `a` is a list of n integers, `stdin` is empty**
