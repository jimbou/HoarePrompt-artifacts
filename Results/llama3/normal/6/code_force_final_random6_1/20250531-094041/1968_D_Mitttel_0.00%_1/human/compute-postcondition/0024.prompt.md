Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: start_pos is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, p is a list of positive integers, a is a list of non-negative integers, len(p) = len(a) = n, where n is a positive integer, score is the sum of a[current_pos - 1] for each iteration, current_pos is the position where the cycle starts, steps is less than k, visited is a dictionary with entries: each position visited mapped to its corresponding step, cycle_start is not -1, cycle_length is the difference between steps and cycle_start, cycle_score is 0, cycle_pos is the current position
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(cycle_length):
    cycle_score += a[cycle_pos - 1]
    cycle_pos = p[cycle_pos - 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: start_pos is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, p is a list of positive integers, a is a list of non-negative integers, len(p) = len(a) = n, where n is a positive integer, score is the sum of a[current_pos - 1] for each iteration, current_pos is the position where the cycle starts, steps is less than k, visited is a dictionary with entries: each position visited mapped to its corresponding step, cycle_start is not -1, cycle_length is at least 1, cycle_score is the sum of a[cycle_pos - 1] for each iteration, cycle_pos is p[cycle_pos - 1].

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: start_pos is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, p is a list of positive integers, a is a list of non-negative integers, len(p) = len(a) = n, where n is a positive integer, score is the sum of a[current_pos - 1] for each iteration, current_pos is the position where the cycle starts, steps is less than k, visited is a dictionary with entries: each position visited mapped to its corresponding step, cycle_start is not -1, cycle_length is at least 2, cycle_score is the sum of a[cycle_pos - 1] for each iteration plus a[cycle_pos - 1], cycle_pos is p[p[cycle_pos - 1] - 1]

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: start_pos is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, p is a list of positive integers, a is a list of non-negative integers, len(p) = len(a) = n, where n is a positive integer, score is the sum of a[current_pos - 1] for each iteration, current_pos is the position where the cycle starts, steps is less than k, visited is a dictionary with entries: each position visited mapped to its corresponding step, cycle_start is not -1, cycle_length is at least 3, cycle_score is the sum of a[cycle_pos - 1] for each iteration plus a[cycle_pos - 1] plus a[cycle_pos - 1], cycle_pos is p[p[p[cycle_pos - 1] - 1] - 1].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
