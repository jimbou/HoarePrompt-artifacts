Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description. The program uses a function `calculate_score` to calculate the score for each player, and then compares the scores to determine the winner. The `calculate_score` function correctly handles the case where the game lasts for a certain number of turns, and also handles the case where a cycle is detected in the permutation. The program also correctly reads the input data and processes it according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
