To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which in this case is only the variable `remainder_steps`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `remainder_steps`. If `remainder_steps` is at least 1, the loop will execute.

State: **`start_pos` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of positive integers, `a` is a list of non-negative integers, `len(p)` = `len(a)` = `n`, where `n` is a positive integer, `score` is the sum of `a[current_pos - 1]` for each iteration plus `full_cycles` * `cycle_score`, `current_pos` is the position where the cycle starts, `steps` is less than `k`, `visited` is a dictionary with entries: each position visited mapped to its corresponding step, `cycle_start` is not -1, `cycle_length` is equal to `cycle_length`, `cycle_score` is the sum of `a[cycle_pos - 1]` for each iteration plus `a[cycle_pos - 1]` plus `a[cycle_pos - 1]` plus ... plus `a[cycle_pos - 1]` (`cycle_length` times), `cycle_pos` is `p[p[p[p...[p[cycle_pos - 1] - 1] - 1] - 1] - 1] - 1] - 1] - 1` (`cycle_length` times), `remaining_steps` is 0, `full_cycles` is the integer division of `remaining_steps` by `cycle_length`, `remainder_steps` must be greater than 0**
