To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `t`. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

State: **data is a list of strings where each string represents an integer or a space-separated list of integers, index is 1, t is a positive integer greater than 0 and equal to the integer value of the first string in data, results is an empty list, stdin is empty**
