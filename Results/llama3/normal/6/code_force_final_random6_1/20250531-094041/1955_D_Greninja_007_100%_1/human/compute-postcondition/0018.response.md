Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6 for all i, `b` is a list of m integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^6 for all i, `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the sorted list b, `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the sorted list a[:m]. If the frequency of a[r] in ca is less than the frequency of a[r] in cb, then the frequency of a[r] in ca is increased by 1 and sm is increased by 1. If sm is greater than or equal to k, then ans is increased by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made. Additionally, the frequency of a[r - m - 1] in ca is decreased by 1.***
