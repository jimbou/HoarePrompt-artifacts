Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6 for all i, `b` is a list of m integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^6 for all i, `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the sorted list b, `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the sorted list a[:m] and the frequency of a[r] in the sorted list a[:m] is increased by 1, `r` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`, `ca[a[r - m - 1]]` is decreased by 1, `sm` is increased by 1, and if `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `sm` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions on `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `cb`, `ca`, and `r` are still valid. Additionally, the condition on `sm` has been updated to reflect the increment operation. If the new value of `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value of `ans` has also been incremented by 1.
