The only variable in the loop head is variable  r, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `r` and `n`. If `r` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `r` is greater than or equal to `m`, `n` is greater than or equal to `r`. So for the loop to be executed one more time `r` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than `r`.
State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6 for all i, `b` is a list of m integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^6 for all i, `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the sorted list b, `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the sorted list a[:m] and the frequency of a[r] in the sorted list a[:m] is increased by 1, `r` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`, `ca[a[r - m - 1]]` is decreased by 1. If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is increased by 1.**
