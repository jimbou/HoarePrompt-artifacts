Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, m is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6 for all i, b is a list of m integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^6 for all i, cb is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the sorted list b, ca is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the sorted list a[:m], ans is 0, sm is the sum of the minimum frequencies of common integers between the sorted list a[:m] and the sorted list b.**

In this output state, the values of n, m, and k remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The lists a and b also remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The Counter object cb contains the frequency of each integer in the sorted list b, and the Counter object ca contains the frequency of each integer in the sorted list a[:m]. The variable ans is initialized to 0, and the variable sm is calculated as the sum of the minimum frequencies of common integers between the sorted list a[:m] and the sorted list b.
