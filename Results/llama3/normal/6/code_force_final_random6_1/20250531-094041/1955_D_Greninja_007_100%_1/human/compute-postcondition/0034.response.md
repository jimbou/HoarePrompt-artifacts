Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6 for all i, `b` is a list of m integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^6 for all i, `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the sorted list b, `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the sorted list a, `r` is equal to `n`, `sm` is either increased by 1 if the frequency of a[r] in ca is less than the frequency of a[r] in cb, or remains the same if the frequency of a[r] in ca is not less than the frequency of a[r] in cb, minus 1 if the frequency of a[r - m] in ca is less than or equal to the frequency of a[r - m] in cb, `ans` is either increased by 1 if sm >= k, the frequency of a[r - m] in ca is less than or equal to the frequency of a[r - m] in cb, and sm is decreased by 1, or remains the same if sm < k or the frequency of a[r - m] in ca is greater than the frequency of a[r - m] in cb, and the frequency of a[r - m] in ca is decreased by 1. If sm is greater than or equal to k, then ans is increased by 1. Otherwise, ans remains the same.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

*   The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
*   The Counter object `cb` still contains the frequency of each integer in the sorted list `b`.
*   The Counter object `ca` now contains the frequency of each integer in the entire sorted list `a`.
*   The variable `r` is now equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has iterated over the entire list `a`.
*   The variable `sm` has been updated based on the comparisons between the frequencies of elements in `ca` and `cb`.
*   The variable `ans` has been incremented by 1 for each iteration where `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, and the frequency of `a[r - m]` in `ca` is less than or equal to the frequency of `a[r - m]` in `cb`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.
