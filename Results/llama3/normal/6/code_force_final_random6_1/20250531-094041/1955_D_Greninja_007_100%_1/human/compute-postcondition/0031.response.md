Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6 for all i, `b` is a list of m integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^6 for all i, `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the sorted list b, `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the sorted list a[:m+2], `r` is m + 2, `sm` is either increased by 1 if the frequency of a[r] in ca is less than the frequency of a[r] in cb, or remains the same if the frequency of a[r] in ca is not less than the frequency of a[r] in cb, minus 1 if the frequency of a[r - m] in ca is less than or equal to the frequency of a[r - m] in cb, `ans` is either increased by 1 if sm >= k, the frequency of a[r - m] in ca is less than or equal to the frequency of a[r - m] in cb, and sm is decreased by 1, or remains the same if sm < k or the frequency of a[r - m] in ca is greater than the frequency of a[r - m] in cb, and the frequency of a[r - m] in ca is decreased by 1.**

In this output state, the frequency of a[r - m] in ca is decreased by 1, which may affect the value of sm and ans. The other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
