Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6 for all i, `b` is a list of m integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^6 for all i, `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the sorted list b, `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the sorted list a[:m] where the frequency of a[r] in ca is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `cb` remain the same as in the initial state. The Counter object `ca` is updated such that the frequency of the integer `a[r]` is increased by 1.
