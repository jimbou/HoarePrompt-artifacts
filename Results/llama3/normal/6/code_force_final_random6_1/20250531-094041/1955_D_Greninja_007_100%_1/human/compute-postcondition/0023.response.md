Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6 for all i, `b` is a list of m integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^6 for all i, `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the sorted list b, `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the sorted list a[:m] where the frequency of a[r] in ca is increased by 1. If the frequency of a[r - m] in ca is less than or equal to the frequency of a[r - m] in cb, then sm is decreased by 1. The frequency of a[r - m] in ca is decreased by 1, and `ans` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
