Output State: **The program returns the number of times the frequency of a[r - m] in ca is less than or equal to the frequency of a[r - m] in cb, and sm is greater than or equal to k, where sm is the difference between the frequency of a[r] in ca and the frequency of a[r] in cb, minus 1 if the frequency of a[r - m] in ca is less than or equal to the frequency of a[r - m] in cb, and ans is increased by 1 if sm >= k, otherwise ans remains the same.**
