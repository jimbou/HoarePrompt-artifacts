Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n`, `m`, `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6 for all i, `b` is a list of m integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^6 for all i, `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the sorted list b, `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the sorted list a[:m]. If the sum of the minimum frequencies of common integers between the sorted list a[:m] and the sorted list b is greater than or equal to k, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for r in range(m, n):
    if ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]]:
        sm += 1
    ca[a[r]] += 1
    if ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]]:
        sm -= 1
    ca[a[r - m]] -= 1
    if sm >= k:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n`, `m`, `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6 for all i, `b` is a list of m integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^6 for all i, `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the sorted list b, `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the sorted list a[:m] and the frequency of a[r] in the sorted list a[:m] is increased by 1, `r` is greater than or equal to `m`, `ca[a[r - m]]` is decreased by 1. If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n`, `m`, `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6 for all i, `b` is a list of m integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^6 for all i, `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the sorted list b, `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the sorted list a[:m]. If sm >= k, then the frequency of a[r] in ca is increased by 1, if the frequency of a[r - m] in ca is less than or equal to the frequency of a[r - m] in cb, then sm is decreased by 1, the frequency of a[r - m] in ca is decreased by 1, and `ans` is increased by 1. If sm < k, then no changes are made to `ca`, `sm`, or `ans`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n`, `m`, `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6 for all i, `b` is a list of m integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^6 for all i, `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the sorted list b, `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the sorted list a[:m+2], `r` is m + 2, `sm` is either increased by 1 if the frequency of a[r] in ca is less than the frequency of a[r] in cb, or remains the same if the frequency of a[r] in ca is not less than the frequency of a[r] in cb, minus 1 if the frequency of a[r - m] in ca is less than or equal to the frequency of a[r - m] in cb, `ans` is either increased by 1 if sm >= k, the frequency of a[r - m] in ca is less than or equal to the frequency of a[r - m] in cb, and sm is decreased by 1, or remains the same if sm < k or the frequency of a[r - m] in ca is greater than the frequency of a[r - m] in cb, and the frequency of a[r - m] in ca is decreased by 1. If sm is greater than or equal to k, then ans is increased by 1. Otherwise, ans remains the same.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
