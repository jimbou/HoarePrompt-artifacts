Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6 for all i, `b` is a list of m integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^6 for all i, `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the sorted list b, `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the sorted list a[:m] and the frequency of a[r] in the sorted list a[:m] is increased by 1, `r` is greater than or equal to `m`. The current value of `ca[a[r - m]]` is less than or equal to `cb[a[r - m]]`. If the frequency of a[r] in the sorted list a[:m] is less than the frequency of a[r] in the sorted list b, then `sm` is increased by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made. However, `sm` is now decreased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `sm` has been decreased by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
