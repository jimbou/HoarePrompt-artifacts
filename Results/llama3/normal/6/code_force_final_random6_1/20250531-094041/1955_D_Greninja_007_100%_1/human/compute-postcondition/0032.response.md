Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6 for all i, `b` is a list of m integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^6 for all i, `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the sorted list b, `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the sorted list a[:m+2], `r` is m + 2, `sm` is either increased by 1 if the frequency of a[r] in ca is less than the frequency of a[r] in cb, or remains the same if the frequency of a[r] in ca is not less than the frequency of a[r] in cb, minus 1 if the frequency of a[r - m] in ca is less than or equal to the frequency of a[r - m] in cb, `ans` is increased by 1.**

The code increments the value of `ans` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `sm` and `ans` are still valid, but `ans` is now increased by 1.
