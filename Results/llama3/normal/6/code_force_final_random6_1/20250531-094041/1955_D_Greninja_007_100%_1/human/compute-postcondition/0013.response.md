Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6 for all i, `b` is a list of m integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^6 for all i, `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the sorted list b, `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the sorted list a[:m] and the frequency of a[r] in the sorted list a[:m] is increased by 1, `r` is greater than or equal to `m`, `ca[a[r - m]]` is decreased by 1. The current value of `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
