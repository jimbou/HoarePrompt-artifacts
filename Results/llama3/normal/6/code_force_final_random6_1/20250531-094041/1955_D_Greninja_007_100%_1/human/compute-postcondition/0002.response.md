Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6 for all i, `b` is a list of m integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^6 for all i, `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the sorted list b, `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the sorted list a[:m], `ans` is 1, and the current value of `sm`, the sum of the minimum frequencies of common integers between the sorted list a[:m] and the sorted list b, is greater than or equal to k.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `ans` being 1. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their original values and properties as specified in the initial state.
