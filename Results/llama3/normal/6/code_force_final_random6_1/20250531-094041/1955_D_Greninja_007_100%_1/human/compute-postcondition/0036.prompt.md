You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6 for all i, and b is a list of m integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^6 for all i.
    cb = Counter(sorted(b))
    ca = Counter(sorted(a[:m]))
    ans = 0
    sm = sum((ca & cb).values())
    if (sm >= k) :
        ans += 1
    #State: `n`, `m`, `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6 for all i, `b` is a list of m integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^6 for all i, `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the sorted list b, `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the sorted list a[:m]. If the sum of the minimum frequencies of common integers between the sorted list a[:m] and the sorted list b is greater than or equal to k, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.
    for r in range(m, n):
        if ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]]:
            sm += 1
        
        ca[a[r]] += 1
        
        if ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]]:
            sm -= 1
        
        ca[a[r - m]] -= 1
        
        if sm >= k:
            ans += 1
        
    #State: `n`, `m`, `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6 for all i, `b` is a list of m integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^6 for all i, `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the sorted list b, `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the sorted list a, `r` is equal to `n`, `sm` is either increased by 1 if the frequency of a[r] in ca is less than the frequency of a[r] in cb, or remains the same if the frequency of a[r] in ca is not less than the frequency of a[r] in cb, minus 1 if the frequency of a[r - m] in ca is less than or equal to the frequency of a[r - m] in cb, `ans` is either increased by 1 if sm >= k, the frequency of a[r - m] in ca is less than or equal to the frequency of a[r - m] in cb, and sm is decreased by 1, or remains the same if sm < k or the frequency of a[r - m] in ca is greater than the frequency of a[r - m] in cb, and the frequency of a[r - m] in ca is decreased by 1. If sm is greater than or equal to k, then ans is increased by 1. Otherwise, ans remains the same.
    return ans
    #The program returns the number of times the frequency of a[r - m] in ca is less than or equal to the frequency of a[r - m] in cb, and sm is greater than or equal to k, where sm is the difference between the frequency of a[r] in ca and the frequency of a[r] in cb, minus 1 if the frequency of a[r - m] in ca is less than or equal to the frequency of a[r - m] in cb, and ans is increased by 1 if sm >= k, otherwise ans remains the same.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the number of times the frequency of a[r - m] in ca is less than or equal to the frequency of a[r - m] in cb, and sm is greater than or equal to k, where sm is the difference between the frequency of a[r] in ca and the frequency of a[r] in cb, minus 1 if the frequency of a[r - m] in ca is less than or equal to the frequency of a[r - m] in cb, and ans is increased by 1 if sm >= k, otherwise ans remains the same.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
