The only variable in the loop head is variable  r, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `r` and `n`. If `r` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `r` is m, `n` is greater than or equal to m. For the loop to execute again `r` must be increased by 1.
State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6 for all i, `b` is a list of m integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^6 for all i, `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the sorted list b, `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the sorted list a[:m+1]. If sm >= k, then the frequency of a[r] in ca is increased by 1, if the frequency of a[r - m] in ca is less than or equal to the frequency of a[r - m] in cb, then sm is decreased by 1, the frequency of a[r - m] in ca is decreased by 1, and `ans` is increased by 1. If sm < k, then no changes are made to `ca`, `sm`, or `ans`. r is m + 1**
