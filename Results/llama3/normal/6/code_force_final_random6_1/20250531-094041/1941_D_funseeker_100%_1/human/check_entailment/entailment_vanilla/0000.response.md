Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` using Function 2.

2. For each test case, it reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the initial player `x` using Function 3.

3. It initializes a set `ans` with the initial player `x`.

4. For each throw, it reads the distance `r` and direction `c` using Function 1.

5. It calculates the possible positions of the ball after the throw by adding or subtracting the distance `r` from the current positions in the set `ans`, depending on the direction `c`. If the direction is '?', it considers both clockwise and counterclockwise directions.

6. It updates the set `ans` with the new possible positions.

7. After all throws, it removes 0 from the set `ans` (if present) and adds `n` instead, because the players are numbered from 1 to `n`.

8. Finally, it prints the number of possible positions and the positions themselves in sorted order.

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It handles all possible cases, including the '?' direction, and ensures that the positions are within the range of 1 to `n`.

Correctness: **True**
