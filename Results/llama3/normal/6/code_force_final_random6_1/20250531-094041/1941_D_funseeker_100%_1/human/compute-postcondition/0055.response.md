Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 2, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least 2 elements from 0 to n-1, `q` is the second element in `ans`, `r` is an integer. If `c` is either '0' or '?', `temp` is a set containing two elements which are the remainder of (q + r) divided by n and the remainder of (q - r) divided by n. If `c` is either '1' or not '?', `temp` is a set containing two elements which are the remainder of (q + r) divided by n and the remainder of (q - r) divided by n.**

In this output state, the value of `temp` has been updated to include the remainder of `(q - r)` divided by `n`, in addition to its previous value which was the remainder of `(q + r)` divided by `n`. The other variables remain unchanged.
