Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing all elements from 0 to n-1 that must have at least 3 elements, `r` is an integer, `c` is a string, `q` is the next element in the set `ans`. If `c` is '1' or '?', then `temp` is a set containing the elements ((q + r) % n) and ((q - r) % n). If `c` is '0', then `temp` is a set containing the element ((q + r) % n). Additionally, `temp` now also contains the element ((q + r) % n).**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `r`, `c`, and `q` remain the same as in the initial state. The set `temp` now contains an additional element, which is the result of the expression `(q + r) % n`. This means that regardless of the value of `c`, `temp` will always contain the element `(q + r) % n`. The other elements in `temp` depend on the value of `c`, as specified in the initial state.
