To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and `m`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable, we don't need to adjust its state. The loop will execute if `m` is at least 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing `x`**
