Functionality: **This function generates a set of numbers based on the input parameters n, m, and x, and then prints the length of the set and its elements in sorted order. The set is constructed by iteratively applying a series of operations defined by the functions func_1 and func_3, which are not shown in the provided code. If the set contains the number 0, it is replaced with the number n. The function ultimately prints the number of elements in the set and the elements themselves, either in the range from 1 to n (if 0 was in the set) or an unknown sequence of numbers (if 0 was not in the set).**
