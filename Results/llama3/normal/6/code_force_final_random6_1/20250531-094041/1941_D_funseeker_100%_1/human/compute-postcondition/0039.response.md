Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing all elements from 0 to n-1 that must have at least 3 elements, `r` is an integer, `c` is a string, `q` is the next element in the set `ans`. If `c` is '0' or '?', then `temp` is a set containing the elements ((q + r) % n) and ((q - r) % n) and also contains the element ((q + r) % n). If `c` is '1', then `temp` is a set containing the elements ((q + r) % n) and ((q - r) % n) and also contains the element ((q - r) % n).**

In this output state, the value of `temp` has been updated to include the element `((q - r) % n)`. The other variables remain unchanged. The set `temp` now contains the elements `((q + r) % n)` and `((q - r) % n)`, and also contains the element `((q - r) % n)` if `c` is '0' or '?', or the element `((q - r) % n)` if `c` is '1'.
