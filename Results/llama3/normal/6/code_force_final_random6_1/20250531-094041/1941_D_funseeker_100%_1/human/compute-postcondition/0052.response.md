The only variable in the loop head is variable `q` and `ans`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `ans`. If `ans` has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `ans` has at least 1 element, `q` is the first element in `ans`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the `ans` must have at least 2 elements and the `q` is the second element in the `ans`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 2, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least 2 elements from 0 to n-1, `q` is the second element in `ans`, `r` is an integer. If `c` is either '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing two elements which are the remainder of (q + r) divided by n and the remainder of (q - r) divided by n. If `c` is either '0' or not '?', `temp` is a set containing one element which is the remainder of (q + r) divided by n.**
