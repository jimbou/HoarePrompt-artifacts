To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `q` and `ans`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `ans`. If `ans` has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `ans` has at least 2 elements, `q` is the second element in `ans`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `ans` must have at least 3 elements, and `q` must be the third element in `ans`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 2, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least 3 elements from 0 to n-1, `q` is the third element in `ans`, `r` is an integer. `temp` is a set containing two elements which are the remainder of (q + r) divided by n and the remainder of (q - r) divided by n.**
