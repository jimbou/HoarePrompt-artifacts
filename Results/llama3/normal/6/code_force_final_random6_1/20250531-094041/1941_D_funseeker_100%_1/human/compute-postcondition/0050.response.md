Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 2, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least 1 element from 0 to n-1, `q` is the first element in `ans`, `r` is an integer, `c` is either '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing two elements which are the remainder of (q + r) divided by n and the remainder of (q - r) divided by n.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `q`, `r`, and `c` remain unchanged. The only change is in the `temp` variable, which now contains two elements: the remainder of `(q + r)` divided by `n` (which was already present) and the remainder of `(q - r)` divided by `n` (which was added by the code).
