Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 2, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least 3 elements from 0 to n-1, `q` is the third element in `ans`, `r` is an integer, `temp` is a set containing three elements which are the remainder of (q + r) divided by n, the remainder of (q - r) divided by n and the remainder of (q + r) divided by n.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `q`, and `r` remain unchanged. The only change is in the `temp` set, which now contains three elements: the remainder of `(q + r)` divided by `n`, the remainder of `(q - r)` divided by `n`, and the remainder of `(q + r)` divided by `n`.
