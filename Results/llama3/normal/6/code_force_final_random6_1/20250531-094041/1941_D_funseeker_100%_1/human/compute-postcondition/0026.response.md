Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing all elements from 0 to n-1 that must not be empty, `r` is an integer, `c` is a string that is either '0' or '?', `temp` is a set containing one element which is (q + r) % n, and `q` is an element in the set `ans`.**

In this output state, the value of `temp` has been updated to include the element `(q + r) % n`, which is the result of adding `q` and `r` and taking the modulus `n`. The other variables remain unchanged.
