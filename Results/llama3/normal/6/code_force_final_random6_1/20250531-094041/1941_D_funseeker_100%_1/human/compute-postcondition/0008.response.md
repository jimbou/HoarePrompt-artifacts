Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least 1 element, `r` is an integer, `c` is a string that is either '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing at least one element which is the remainder of the division of (q - r) by n.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, and `r` remain unchanged. The value of `c` is also unchanged, which is either '1' or '?'. The only change is in the `temp` set, which now contains at least one element, specifically the remainder of the division of `(q - r)` by `n`.
