Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the possible positions of the ball after a series of throws. It uses a set to keep track of the possible positions, and for each throw, it updates the set by considering both clockwise and counterclockwise directions. The program also handles the case where the direction of the throw is unknown ('?') by considering both possibilities.

The program correctly handles the case where the ball is thrown to a position that is equivalent to 0 (i.e., the last player in the circle) by discarding 0 from the set and adding the total number of players (n) to the set.

The program also correctly prints the number of possible positions and the positions themselves in increasing order.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
