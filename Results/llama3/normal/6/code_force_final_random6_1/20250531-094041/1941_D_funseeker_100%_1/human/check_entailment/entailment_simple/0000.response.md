Reasoning: The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described. It correctly handles the input, processes the throws, and outputs the possible positions of the ball after the throws. The program uses a set to keep track of the possible positions, which allows it to efficiently handle the cases where the direction of a throw is unknown. The program also correctly handles the case where the ball is thrown to a position that is equivalent to 0 (i.e., the last player in the circle), by discarding 0 from the set and adding the total number of players to the set. The program then prints the number of possible positions and the positions themselves in sorted order.

Correctness: **True**
