Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is greater than 1, x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, ans is a set containing all elements from 0 to n-1, r is an integer, c is a string, temp is an empty set**

The code snippet executes as follows:

1. `r, c = func_1().split()`: This line assigns the result of `func_1().split()` to `r` and `c`. Since `func_1()` is not defined in the given code, we assume it returns a string. The `split()` method splits this string into two parts, which are assigned to `r` and `c`. The exact values of `r` and `c` depend on the return value of `func_1()`.

2. `r = int(r)`: This line converts the value of `r` to an integer. Since `r` was previously assigned a string value, this conversion will succeed only if the string represents an integer. If the string does not represent an integer, this line will raise a `ValueError`.

3. `temp = set()`: This line assigns an empty set to `temp`. This line does not depend on any previous values, so it simply sets `temp` to an empty set.

After executing all lines, the final state is:

- `n` remains a positive integer, as it was not modified by the code.
- `m` remains greater than 1, as it was not modified by the code.
- `x` remains a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, as it was not modified by the code.
- `ans` remains a set containing all elements from 0 to n-1, as it was not modified by the code.
- `r` is now an integer, which is the result of converting the string value assigned in the first line to an integer.
- `c` is now a string, which is the second part of the result of `func_1().split()`.
- `temp` is now an empty set, as assigned in the third line.

Note that the exact values of `r` and `c` depend on the return value of `func_1()`, which is not defined in the given code.
