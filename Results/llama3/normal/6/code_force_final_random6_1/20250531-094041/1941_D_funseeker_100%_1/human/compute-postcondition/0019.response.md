Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least 3 elements, `r` is an integer. If `c` is either '1' or '?', then `temp` is a set containing at least 5 elements which are the remainder of the division of (q - r) by n, (q + r) % n, (q - r) % n, (q + r) % n, and (q - r) % n, and `q` is the third element in the set `ans`. If `c` is '0', then `temp` is a set containing at least 4 elements which are the remainder of the division of (q - r) by n, (q + r) % n, (q + r) % n, and (q - r) % n, and `q` is the third element in the set `ans`.***
