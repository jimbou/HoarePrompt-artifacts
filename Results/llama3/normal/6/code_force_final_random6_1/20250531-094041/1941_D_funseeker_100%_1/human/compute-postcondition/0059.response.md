Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 2, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least 3 elements from 0 to n-1, `q` is the third element in `ans`, `r` is an integer. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` is a set containing three elements which are the remainder of (q + r) divided by n, the remainder of (q - r) divided by n and the remainder of (q + r) divided by n. Otherwise, `temp` is a set containing two elements which are the remainder of (q + r) divided by n and the remainder of (q - r) divided by n.***
