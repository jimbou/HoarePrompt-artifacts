Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least 1 element, `r` is an integer, `c` is a string that is either '1' or '?'. The current value of `c` is either '1' or '?'. The state of the variables `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, and `r` remains unchanged.**
