Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least 2 elements, `r` is an integer, `c` is either '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing at least 2 elements which are the remainder of the division of (q - r) by n and (q + r) % n, and `q` is the second element in the set `ans`.**

In this output state, the value of `temp` has been updated to include the result of `(q + r) % n`, in addition to its previous value which is the remainder of the division of `(q - r)` by `n`. The other variables remain unchanged.
