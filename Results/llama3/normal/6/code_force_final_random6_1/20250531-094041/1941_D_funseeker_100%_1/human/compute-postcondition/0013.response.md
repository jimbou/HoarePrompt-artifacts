Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least 2 elements, `r` is an integer. If `c` is either '0' or '?', then `temp` is a set containing at least 3 elements which are the remainder of the division of (q - r) by n, (q + r) % n, and (q - r) % n, and `q` is the second element in the set `ans`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `temp` has been updated to include the remainder of the division of `(q - r)` by `n`, in addition to the previous values `(q - r) % n` and `(q + r) % n`. The other variables remain unchanged.
