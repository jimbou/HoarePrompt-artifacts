Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least 3 elements, `r` is an integer. If `c` is either '1' or '?', then `temp` is a set containing at least 4 elements which are the remainder of the division of (q - r) by n, (q + r) % n, (q - r) % n, and (q + r) % n, and `q` is the third element in the set `ans`. If `c` is '0', then `temp` is a set containing at least 3 elements which are the remainder of the division of (q - r) by n, (q + r) % n, and (q + r) % n, and `q` is the third element in the set `ans`.**

In this output state, the value of `temp` has been updated to include an additional element, which is the remainder of the division of `(q + r)` by `n`. The other variables remain unchanged. The set `temp` now contains at least 4 elements if `c` is either '1' or '?', and at least 3 elements if `c` is '0'.
