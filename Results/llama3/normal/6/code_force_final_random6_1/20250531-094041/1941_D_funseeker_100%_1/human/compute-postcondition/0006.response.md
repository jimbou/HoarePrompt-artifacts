Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least 1 element, `r` is an integer, `c` is a string. If `c` is either '0' or '?', then `temp` is a set containing at least 1 element which is (q + r) % n, and `q` is the first element in the set `ans`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
