#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains one input: a string
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
    #The program returns a string that was provided as input from stdin, with any leading or trailing whitespace removed.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads a string from standard input, removes any leading or trailing whitespace, and returns the resulting string.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: func_1() returns a string that can be converted to an integer.
    return int(func_1())
    #The program returns an integer that is converted from a string returned by func_1()

#Overall this is what the function does:Converts a string returned by func_1() to an integer and returns the result.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: func_1() returns a string of space-separated integers.
    return list(map(int, func_1().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers, where each integer is a result of converting a string of space-separated integers returned by func_1() into an integer.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns a list of integers. It takes a string of space-separated integers returned by another function, func_1(), splits it into individual strings, converts each string into an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, m is a non-negative integer, and x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n.
    n, m, x = func_3()
    ans = {x}
    for _ in range(m):
        r, c = func_1().split()
        
        r = int(r)
        
        temp = set()
        
        for q in ans:
            if c == '0' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q + r) % n)
            if c == '1' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q - r) % n)
        
        ans = temp
        
    #State: n is a positive integer, m is a non-negative integer, x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, ans is a set containing all elements from 0 to n-1, r is an integer, c is a string, temp is a set containing all elements from 0 to n-1.
    if (0 in ans) :
        ans.discard(0)
        ans.add(n)
    #State: *n is a positive integer, m is a non-negative integer, x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, if 0 is in the set ans, then ans is a set containing all elements from 1 to n including n, otherwise ans remains unchanged, r is an integer, c is a string, temp is a set containing all elements from 0 to n-1.
    print(len(ans))
    #This is printed: the number of elements in the set ans, which is either n if 0 is in ans, or the original number of elements in ans if 0 is not in ans
    print(*sorted(ans))
    #This is printed: a sequence of numbers from 1 to n in sorted order (if 0 is in ans), or an unknown sequence of numbers (if 0 is not in ans), followed by the length of the set ans

#Overall this is what the function does:This function generates a set of numbers based on the input parameters n, m, and x, and then prints the length of the set and its elements in sorted order. The set is constructed by iteratively applying a series of operations defined by the functions func_1 and func_3, which are not shown in the provided code. If the set contains the number 0, it is replaced with the number n. The function ultimately prints the number of elements in the set and the elements themselves, either in the range from 1 to n (if 0 was in the set) or an unknown sequence of numbers (if 0 was not in the set).
