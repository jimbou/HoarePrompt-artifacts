Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, m is at least 1, x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, ans is a set containing x, r is an integer, c is a string, temp is an empty set
Code of the loop:
for q in ans:
    if c == '0' or c == '?':
        temp.add((q + r) % n)
    if c == '1' or c == '?':
        temp.add((q - r) % n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least 1 element, `r` is an integer. If `c` is either '1' or '?', then `c` is either '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing at least one element which is the remainder of the division of (q - r) by n. If `c` is either '0' or '?', then `temp` is a set containing at least 1 element which is (q + r) % n, and `q` is the first element in the set `ans`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least 2 elements, `r` is an integer. If `c` is either '1' or '?', then `temp` is a set containing at least 3 elements which are the remainder of the division of (q - r) by n, (q + r) % n, and (q - r) % n, and `q` is the second element in the set `ans`. If `c` is '0', then `temp` is a set containing at least 2 elements which are the remainder of the division of (q - r) by n and (q + r) % n, and `q` is the second element in the set `ans`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least 3 elements, `r` is an integer. If `c` is either '1' or '?', then `temp` is a set containing at least 5 elements which are the remainder of the division of (q - r) by n, (q + r) % n, (q - r) % n, (q + r) % n, and (q - r) % n, and `q` is the third element in the set `ans`. If `c` is '0', then `temp` is a set containing at least 4 elements which are the remainder of the division of (q - r) by n, (q + r) % n, (q + r) % n, and (q - r) % n, and `q` is the third element in the set `ans`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
