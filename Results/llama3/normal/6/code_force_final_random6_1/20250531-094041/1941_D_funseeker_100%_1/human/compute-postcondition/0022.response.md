The only variable in the loop head is variable `m`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If `m` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing all elements from 0 to n-1, `r` is an integer, `c` is a string, `temp` is a set containing all elements from 0 to n-1**
