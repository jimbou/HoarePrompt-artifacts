Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least 3 elements, `r` is an integer. If `c` is either '1' or '?', then `temp` is a set containing at least 5 elements which are the remainder of the division of (q - r) by n, (q + r) % n, (q - r) % n, (q + r) % n, and (q - r) % n, and `q` is the third element in the set `ans`. If `c` is '0', then `temp` is a set containing at least 4 elements which are the remainder of the division of (q - r) by n, (q + r) % n, (q + r) % n, and (q - r) % n, and `q` is the third element in the set `ans`.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, and `r` remain unchanged. The only change is in the set `temp`, which now contains an additional element `(q - r) % n`. The size of `temp` has increased by 1, and its elements are updated accordingly based on the value of `c`.
