To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `q` and `ans`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `ans` has at least one more element. At the end of the last iteration, `ans` has at least 2 elements, and `q` is the second element in the set `ans`. For the loop to execute again, `ans` must have at least 3 elements, and `q` must be the third element in the set `ans`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least 3 elements, `r` is an integer. If `c` is either '1' or '?', then `temp` is a set containing at least 3 elements which are the remainder of the division of (q - r) by n, (q + r) % n, and (q - r) % n, and `q` is the third element in the set `ans`. If `c` is '0', then `temp` is a set containing at least 2 elements which are the remainder of the division of (q - r) by n and (q + r) % n, and `q` is the third element in the set `ans`.**
