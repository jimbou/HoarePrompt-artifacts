Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing all elements from 0 to n-1 that must not be empty, `r` is an integer, `c` is a string. The current value of `c` is either '1' or '?'. If `c` was '0' or '?', `temp` is a set containing two elements which are (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n, and `q` was an element in the set `ans`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `temp` has been updated to include the new element `(q - r) % n` when `c` was '0' or '?'. The other variables remain unchanged.
