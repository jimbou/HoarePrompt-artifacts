Output State: **`t` is at least `n * 2 + 3`, `i` is `n * 2 + 1`, `ans_f` is a list containing `ans` at least the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` in each iteration plus the current `ans` value plus the last calculated `ans` value, `n` is an integer equal to the input value, `l` is a string equal to the input value, `lst` is a list containing the elements of `l` split by spaces, and stdin contains `t-5` inputs: `t-5` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `ans_f` has been updated by appending the last calculated `ans` value to the list. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-5` inputs, as the code does not affect the input.
