Output State: **`t` is at least `n * 2 + 2`, `i` is `n * 2`, `ans_f` is a list containing `ans` at least the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` in each iteration plus the current `ans` value, `n` is an integer equal to the input value, `l` is a string equal to the input value, `lst` is an empty list, and `stdin` contains `t-3` inputs: `t-3` test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` is at least `n * 2 + 2`, `i` is `n * 2`, `ans_f` now contains the current `ans` value in addition to its previous values, `n` is still equal to the input value, `l` is still equal to the input value, `lst` is still empty, and `stdin` still contains `t-3` test cases.
