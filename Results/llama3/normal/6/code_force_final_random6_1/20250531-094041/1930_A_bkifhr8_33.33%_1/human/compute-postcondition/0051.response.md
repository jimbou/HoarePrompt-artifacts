Output State: **t is at least n * 2 + 4, i is n * 2 + 3, ans_f is a list containing ans at least the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of lst in each iteration plus the current ans value, n is an integer equal to the input value and must be greater than 1, l is a string equal to the input value, lst is a list containing the elements of l split by spaces with the first two elements removed if lst had a length not equal to 2, ans is increased by the minimum of the first two elements of lst, and stdin contains t-8 inputs: t-8 test cases if lst had exactly 2 elements, or t-7 inputs: t-7 test cases if lst had a length not equal to 2.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been increased by the minimum of the first two elements of `lst`. If `lst` had exactly 2 elements, it remains unchanged. If `lst` had a length not equal to 2, the first two elements of `lst` are removed. The number of test cases in `stdin` is reduced by 1, resulting in either `t-8` or `t-7` test cases depending on the length of `lst`. All other variables remain unchanged.
