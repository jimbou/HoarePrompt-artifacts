Postcondition: ***`t` is at least `n * 2 + 3`, `i` is `n * 2 + 1`, `ans_f` is a list containing `ans` at least the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` in each iteration plus the current `ans` value, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and must be greater than 0, `l` is a string equal to the input value, `lst` is a list containing the elements of `l` split by spaces and has a length not equal to 2, and stdin contains `t-5` inputs: `t-5` test cases***
