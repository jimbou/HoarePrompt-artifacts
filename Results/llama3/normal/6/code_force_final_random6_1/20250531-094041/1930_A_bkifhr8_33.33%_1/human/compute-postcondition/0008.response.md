Postcondition: ***t is at least 1, i is 0, ans_f is an empty list, ans is at least the minimum of the first two elements of lst if lst has exactly 2 elements, otherwise ans is at least the original value of ans, n is at least 1, l is a string, lst is a list of strings, stdin contains t-2 inputs: t-2 test cases***
