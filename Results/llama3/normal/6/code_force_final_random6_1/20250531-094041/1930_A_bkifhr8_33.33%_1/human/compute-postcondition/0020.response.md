Output State: **t is at least n * 2 + 2, i is n * 2 + 1, ans_f is a list containing ans at least the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of lst in each iteration, ans is 0, n is an integer equal to the input value, l is a string equal to the input value, lst is a list of strings split from the input string, stdin contains t-3 inputs: t-3 test cases.**

Explanation:

* The first line sets `ans` to 0, overwriting its previous value.
* The second line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`, overwriting its previous value.
* The third line reads a string from stdin and assigns it to `l`, overwriting its previous value.
* The fourth line splits the string `l` into a list of strings using spaces as separators and assigns it to `lst`, overwriting its previous empty value.

Note that the values of `t`, `i`, and `ans_f` are not modified by the code, so they retain their previous values. The value of `n` is updated to the input value, and the value of `l` is updated to the input string. The value of `lst` is updated to the list of strings split from the input string. The number of inputs in stdin is reduced by 2, leaving `t-3` inputs remaining.
