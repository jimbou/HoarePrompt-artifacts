Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum final score that can be achieved by performing the n moves. The issue lies in the way the program removes elements from the list `lst`. 

In the line `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])`, the program is trying to remove the first element of the list, but it is using `0 * 2` as the index, which is equivalent to `0`. This means that the program is always removing the first element of the list, regardless of whether it is the minimum of the two elements or not.

A correct implementation would involve sorting the list `lst` in ascending order and then removing the smallest element and the next smallest element in each iteration. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for i in range(t):
        ans = 0
        n = int(input())
        l = input()
        lst = list(map(int, l.split(' ')))
        lst.sort()
        for i in range(n):
            ans += lst[2*i]
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)
```

This corrected program sorts the list `lst` in ascending order and then adds the smallest element and the next smallest element to the score in each iteration. This ensures that the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum final score that can be achieved by performing the n moves.
