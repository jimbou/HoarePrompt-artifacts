Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is `n` * 2, `ans_f` is a list containing `ans` at least the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` in each iteration, `ans` is at least the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` in each iteration, `n` is an integer, `l` is a string, `lst` is an empty list, stdin contains `t-2` inputs: `t-2` test cases.**

The code appends the value of `ans` to the list `ans_f`. The value of `ans` is at least the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` in each iteration, but the exact value is not specified. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-2` inputs, which are `t-2` test cases.
