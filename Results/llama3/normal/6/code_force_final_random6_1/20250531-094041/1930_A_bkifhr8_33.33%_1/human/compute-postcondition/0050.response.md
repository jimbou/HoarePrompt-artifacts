Output State: **t is at least n * 2 + 4, i is n * 2 + 3, ans_f is a list containing ans at least the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of lst in each iteration plus the current ans value, n is an integer equal to the input value and must be greater than 1, l is a string equal to the input value, lst is a list containing the elements of l split by spaces with the first two elements removed, ans is increased by the minimum of the first two elements of lst, and stdin contains t-8 inputs: t-8 test cases if lst had exactly 2 elements, or t-7 inputs: t-7 test cases if lst had a length not equal to 2.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `i` also remains the same. The list `ans_f` still contains `ans` at least the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` in each iteration plus the current `ans` value, but its value is not explicitly updated in this code snippet. The value of `n` remains an integer equal to the input value and must be greater than 1. The string `l` remains equal to the input value. The list `lst` is modified by removing the first two elements, regardless of its original length. The value of `ans` is increased by the minimum of the first two elements of `lst`. The number of inputs in `stdin` is reduced by 1 if `lst` had exactly 2 elements, or by 2 if `lst` had a length not equal to 2.
