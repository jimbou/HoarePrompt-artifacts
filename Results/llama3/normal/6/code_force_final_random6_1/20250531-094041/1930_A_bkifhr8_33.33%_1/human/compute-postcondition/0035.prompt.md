Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is at least n * 2 + 2, i is n * 2 + 1, ans_f is a list containing ans at least the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of lst in each iteration, ans is 0, n is an integer equal to the input value, l is a string equal to the input value, lst is a list of strings split from the input string, stdin contains t-3 inputs: t-3 test cases.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n * 2):
    if len(lst) != 2:
        ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
        lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
        lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
    else:
        ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is at least `n * 2 + 2`, `i` is `n * 2 + 1`, `ans_f` is a list containing `ans` at least the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` in each iteration, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and at least 1, `l` is a string equal to the input value, `lst` is a list of strings split from the input string, and `stdin` contains `t-3` inputs: `t-3` test cases. If the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, `ans` is the original value plus the minimum of the first two elements of `lst`, and `lst` has the first two elements removed. Otherwise, `ans` is the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is at least `n * 2 + 2`, `i` is `n * 2 + 2`, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and at least 1, `l` is a string equal to the input value, `lst` is a list of strings split from the input string, and `stdin` contains `t-3` inputs: `t-3` test cases. If the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, `lst` has the first two elements removed. Otherwise, `ans_f` is a list containing `ans` at least the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` in each iteration plus the minimum of the first two elements of `lst`, and `stdin` contains `t-4` inputs: `t-4` test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is at least `n * 2 + 2`, `i` is `n * 2 + 1`, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and at least 2, `l` is a string equal to the input value, `lst` is a list of strings split from the input string, `ans_f` is a list containing `ans` at least the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` in each iteration plus the minimum of the first two elements of `lst`, and `stdin` contains `t-4` inputs: `t-4` test cases. If the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, the first two elements of `lst` are removed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
