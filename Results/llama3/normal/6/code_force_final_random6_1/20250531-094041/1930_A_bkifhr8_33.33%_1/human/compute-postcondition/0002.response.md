Output State: **t is at least 1, i is 0, ans_f is an empty list, ans is 0, n is an integer, l is a string, lst is a list of strings, stdin contains t-2 inputs: t-2 test cases**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `t` remains at least 1, and `i` remains 0. The list `ans_f` is still empty. A new variable `ans` is introduced and initialized to 0. The variable `n` is assigned an integer value from the first input in `stdin`, which is now reduced to `t-2` inputs. The variable `l` is assigned a string value from the second input in `stdin`, and the variable `lst` is assigned a list of strings split from the string `l`. The remaining `t-2` test cases are still in `stdin`.
