To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(n * 2):`. The variables involved are `i` and `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is at least 1.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.

The value of `n` does not change, as it is not modified within the loop body.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `ans_f` is an empty list, `ans` is at least the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` if `lst` has exactly 2 elements, otherwise `ans` is at least the original value of `ans`, `n` is at least 1, `l` is a string, `lst` is a list of strings, `stdin` contains `t-2` inputs: `t-2` test cases**
