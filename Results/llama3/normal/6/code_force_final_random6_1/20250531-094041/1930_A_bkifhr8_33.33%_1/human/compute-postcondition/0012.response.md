Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `ans_f` is an empty list, `n` is at least 1, `l` is a string, `stdin` contains `t-2` inputs: `t-2` test cases. If `lst` has exactly 2 elements, `ans` is at least the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` plus the original value of `ans`. If `lst` has more than 2 elements, `lst` has the first two elements removed, and `ans` is at least the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` plus the original value of `ans`.***
