Output State: **`t` is at least `n * 2 + t`, `i` is `n * 2 + t - 1`, `ans_f` is a list containing `ans` at least the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` in each iteration plus the current `ans` value plus the last calculated `ans` value, ..., plus the last calculated `ans` value, `n` is an integer equal to the input value, `l` is a string equal to the input value, `lst` is an empty list, and stdin contains `t-t` inputs: `t-t` test cases.**

This output state means that after the loop executes all the iterations, the variable `t` will be at least `n * 2 + t`, which means it will be at least the sum of the number of test cases and the number of iterations. The variable `i` will be `n * 2 + t - 1`, which means it will be the last index of the loop. The list `ans_f` will contain the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` in each iteration, plus the current `ans` value, plus the last calculated `ans` value, ..., plus the last calculated `ans` value. The variable `n` will be an integer equal to the input value, the variable `l` will be a string equal to the input value, and the list `lst` will be an empty list. Finally, stdin will contain `t-t` inputs, which means it will be empty.
