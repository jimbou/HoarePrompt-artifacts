The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n * 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n * 2 + 2`, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and at least 1. For the loop to execute again `i` must be less than `n * 2` so `i` is `n * 2 + 1` and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than `n` so `n` is `n + 1`.
State: **`t` is at least `n * 2 + 2`, `i` is `n * 2 + 1`, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and at least 2, `l` is a string equal to the input value, `lst` is a list of strings split from the input string, and `stdin` contains `t-3` inputs: `t-3` test cases. If the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, `lst` has the first two elements removed. Otherwise, `ans_f` is a list containing `ans` at least the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` in each iteration plus the minimum of the first two elements of `lst`, and `stdin` contains `t-4` inputs: `t-4` test cases.**
