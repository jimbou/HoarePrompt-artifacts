Postcondition: ***`t` is at least `n * 2 + 2`, `i` is `n * 2 + 2`, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and at least 1, `l` is a string equal to the input value, `lst` is a list of strings split from the input string, and `stdin` contains `t-3` inputs: `t-3` test cases. If the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, `lst` has the first two elements removed. Otherwise, `ans_f` is a list containing `ans` at least the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` in each iteration plus the minimum of the first two elements of `lst`, and `stdin` contains `t-4` inputs: `t-4` test cases.***
