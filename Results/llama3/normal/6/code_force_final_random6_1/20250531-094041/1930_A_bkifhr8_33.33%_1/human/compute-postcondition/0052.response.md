Postcondition: ***`t` is at least `n * 2 + 4`, `i` is `n * 2 + 3`, `ans_f` is a list containing `ans` at least the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` in each iteration plus the current `ans` value, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and must be greater than 1, `l` is a string equal to the input value, `lst` is a list containing the elements of `l` split by spaces, `ans` is increased by the minimum of the first two elements of `lst`, and `stdin` contains `t-8` inputs: `t-8` test cases if `lst` had exactly 2 elements, or `t-7` inputs: `t-7` test cases if `lst` had a length not equal to 2. If `lst` had exactly 2 elements, `lst` remains unchanged. If `lst` had a length not equal to 2, the first two elements of `lst` are removed.***
