Output State: **t is at least n * 2 + 2, i is n * 2 + 1, n is an integer equal to the input value and at least 2, l is a string equal to the input value, lst is a list of strings split from the input string with the first two elements removed, ans_f is a list containing ans at least the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of lst in each iteration plus the minimum of the first two elements of lst, and stdin contains t-4 inputs: t-4 test cases.**

Here's a natural language description of the output state:

The value of `t` remains at least `n * 2 + 2`, and `i` remains `n * 2 + 1`. The value of `n` is still an integer equal to the input value and at least 2. The string `l` remains equal to the input value. The list `lst` has been modified by removing the first two elements, resulting in a new list of strings split from the input string. The list `ans_f` now contains the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` in each iteration, plus the minimum of the first two elements of `lst`. The number of inputs in `stdin` has decreased by 1, leaving `t-4` inputs: `t-4` test cases.
