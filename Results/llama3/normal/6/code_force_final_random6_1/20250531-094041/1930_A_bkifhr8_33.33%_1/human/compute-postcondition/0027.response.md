To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n * 2`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n * 2 + 1`, which is greater than `n * 2`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, making it `n * 2 + 2`.

The state of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

The other variables, `t`, `ans_f`, `l`, `lst`, and `stdin`, are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is at least `n * 2 + 2`, `i` is `n * 2 + 2`, `ans_f` is a list containing `ans` at least the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` in each iteration, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and at least 1, `l` is a string equal to the input value, `lst` is a list of strings split from the input string, and `stdin` contains `t-3` inputs: `t-3` test cases.**
