Output State: **t is at least n * 2 + 3, i is n * 2 + 1, ans_f is a list containing ans at least the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of lst in each iteration plus the current ans value, n is an integer equal to the input value and must be greater than 0, l is a string equal to the input value, lst is a list containing the elements of l split by spaces and has a length not equal to 2, ans is at least the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of lst in each iteration plus the current ans value, stdin contains t-5 inputs: t-5 test cases**

The code increments `ans` by the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` and removes the first two elements from `lst`. The value of `ans` is updated to be at least the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` in each iteration plus the current `ans` value. The length of `lst` is reduced by 2. No other variables are affected.
