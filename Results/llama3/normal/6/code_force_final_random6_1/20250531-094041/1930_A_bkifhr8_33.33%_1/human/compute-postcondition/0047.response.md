Output State: **t is at least n * 2 + 4, i is n * 2 + 2, ans_f is a list containing ans at least the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of lst in each iteration plus the current ans value, n is an integer equal to the input value and must be greater than 1, l is a string equal to the input value, lst is a list containing the elements of l split by spaces, ans is increased by the minimum of the first two elements of lst, stdin contains t-8 inputs: t-8 test cases if lst has exactly 2 elements, or stdin contains t-7 inputs: t-7 test cases if lst has a length not equal to 2.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been increased by the minimum of the first two elements of `lst`. The value of `t`, `i`, `n`, `l`, and `lst` remains unchanged. The value of `ans_f` has also been updated to include the new value of `ans`. The number of test cases in `stdin` has been reduced by 1, as one test case has been processed.
