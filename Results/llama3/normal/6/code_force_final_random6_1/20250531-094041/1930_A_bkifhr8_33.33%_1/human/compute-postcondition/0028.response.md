Output State: **t is at least n * 2 + 2, i is n * 2 + 2, ans_f is a list containing ans at least the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of lst in each iteration, n is an integer equal to the input value and at least 1, l is a string equal to the input value, lst is a list of strings split from the input string with the first two elements removed, and stdin contains t-3 inputs: t-3 test cases.**

The code snippet increments `ans` by the minimum of the first two elements of `lst`, which are then removed from `lst`. The value of `t`, `i`, `n`, `l`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The value of `ans_f` is updated to include the new value of `ans`.
