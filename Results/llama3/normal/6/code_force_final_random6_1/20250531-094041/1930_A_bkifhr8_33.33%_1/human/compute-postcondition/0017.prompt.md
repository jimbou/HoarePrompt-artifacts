Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is at least 1, i is 0, ans_f is an empty list, ans is 0, n is an integer, l is a string, lst is a list of strings, stdin contains t-2 inputs: t-2 test cases
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n * 2):
    if len(lst) != 2:
        ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
        lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
        lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
    else:
        ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is at least 1, i is 0, ans_f is an empty list, ans is at least the minimum of the first two elements of lst if lst has exactly 2 elements, otherwise ans is at least the original value of ans, n is at least 1, l is a string, lst is a list of strings, stdin contains t-2 inputs: t-2 test cases

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `ans_f` is an empty list, `n` is at least 1, `l` is a string, `stdin` contains `t-2` inputs: `t-2` test cases. If `lst` has exactly 2 elements, `ans` is at least the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` plus the original value of `ans`. If `lst` has more than 2 elements, `lst` has the first two elements removed, and `ans` is at least the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` plus the original value of `ans`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is at least 1, i is 2, ans_f is an empty list, n is greater than 1, l is a string, stdin contains t-2 inputs: t-2 test cases. If lst has more than 2 elements, lst has at least 2 fewer elements than before, ans is at least the minimum of the first two elements of the original lst plus the original value of ans. If lst has exactly 2 elements, ans is at least the minimum of the first two elements of lst plus the original value of ans.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
