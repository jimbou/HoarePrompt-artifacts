To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n * 2` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is at least n * 2 + 3, `i` is n * 2 + 1, `ans_f` is a list containing ans at least the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of lst in each iteration plus the current ans value, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and must be greater than 0, `l` is a string equal to the input value, `lst` is a list containing the elements of l split by spaces, and stdin contains t-5 inputs: t-5 test cases**
