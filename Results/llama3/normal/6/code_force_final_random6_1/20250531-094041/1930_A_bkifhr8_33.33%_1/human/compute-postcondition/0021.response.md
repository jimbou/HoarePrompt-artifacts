To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n * 2` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is at least `n * 2 + 2`, `i` is `n * 2 + 1`, `ans_f` is a list containing `ans` at least the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` in each iteration, `ans` is 0, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and at least 1, `l` is a string equal to the input value, `lst` is a list of strings split from the input string, `stdin` contains `t-3` inputs: `t-3` test cases**
