Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by iterating through the list of numbers and adding the minimum of each pair to the score. However, there are a few issues with the implementation:

1. The program is removing elements from the list while iterating through it, which can lead to incorrect results. This is because the indices of the elements in the list change when an element is removed, causing the program to skip or repeat elements.

2. The program is not sorting the list of numbers before pairing them up. This means that the program is not guaranteed to find the optimal solution, which requires pairing up the smallest numbers first.

3. The program is using a complicated and incorrect way to remove elements from the list. The line `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` is attempting to remove the first element of the list, but it is not doing so correctly. The correct way to remove the first element of a list in Python is `lst.pop(0)`.

4. The program is not handling the case where the list has an odd number of elements correctly. In this case, the program should pair up all the elements except the last one, which should be added to the score on its own.

5. The program is using a lot of unnecessary variables and lists. The program can be simplified by using a single list to store the numbers and a single variable to store the score.

6. The program is not following the problem's constraints. The problem states that the input will contain 2n positive integers, but the program is not checking for this.

7. The program is not handling the case where the input is invalid. The program should check that the input is valid before attempting to process it.

8. The program is not following the problem's output format. The problem states that the output should be a single integer, but the program is printing a list of integers.

Correctness: **False**
