The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n * 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n * 2 + 1`, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is `n * 2 + 2` and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is at least `n * 2 + 4`, `i` is `n * 2 + 2`, `ans_f` is a list containing `ans` at least the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` in each iteration plus the current `ans` value, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and must be greater than 1, `l` is a string equal to the input value, `lst` is a list containing the elements of `l` split by spaces. If `lst` has exactly 2 elements, `ans` is increased by the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` and `stdin` contains `t-8` inputs: `t-8` test cases. If `lst` has a length not equal to 2, `ans` is at least the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` in each iteration plus the current `ans` value and `stdin` contains `t-7` inputs: `t-7` test cases.**
