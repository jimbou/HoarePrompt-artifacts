To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in ans_f:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `i` and `ans_f`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the contents of `ans_f`. If `ans_f` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `ans_f` is a list containing at least 1 element, and `i` is the last element of `ans_f`.

For the loop to execute again, `ans_f` must have at least one more element, and `i` must be the next element in `ans_f`.

State: **`t` is at least `n * 2 + t`, `i` is the next element in `ans_f`, `ans_f` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `n` is an integer equal to the input value, `l` is a string equal to the input value, `lst` is an empty list, and stdin contains `t-t` inputs: `t-t` test cases**
