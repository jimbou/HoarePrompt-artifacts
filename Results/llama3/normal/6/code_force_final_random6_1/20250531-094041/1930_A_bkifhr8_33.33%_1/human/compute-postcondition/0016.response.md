Postcondition: ***t is at least 1, i is 2, ans_f is an empty list, n is greater than 1, l is a string, stdin contains t-2 inputs: t-2 test cases. If lst has more than 2 elements, lst has at least 2 fewer elements than before, ans is at least the minimum of the first two elements of the original lst plus the original value of ans. If lst has exactly 2 elements, ans is at least the minimum of the first two elements of lst plus the original value of ans.***
