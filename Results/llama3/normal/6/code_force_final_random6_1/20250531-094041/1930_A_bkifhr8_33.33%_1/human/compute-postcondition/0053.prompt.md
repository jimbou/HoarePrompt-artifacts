Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is at least n * 2 + 3, i is n * 2 + 1, ans_f is a list containing ans at least the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of lst in each iteration plus the current ans value, n is an integer equal to the input value, l is a string equal to the input value, lst is a list containing the elements of l split by spaces, and stdin contains t-5 inputs: t-5 test cases.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n * 2):
    if len(lst) != 2:
        ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
        lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
        lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
    else:
        ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is at least n * 2 + 3, i is n * 2 + 1, ans_f is a list containing ans at least the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of lst in each iteration plus the current ans value, n is an integer equal to the input value and must be greater than 0, l is a string equal to the input value, lst is a list containing the elements of l split by spaces. If lst has exactly 2 elements, ans is increased by the minimum of the first two elements of lst and stdin contains t-6 inputs: t-6 test cases. If lst has a length not equal to 2, ans is at least the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of lst in each iteration plus the current ans value and stdin contains t-5 inputs: t-5 test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is at least n * 2 + 4, i is n * 2 + 2, ans_f is a list containing ans at least the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of lst in each iteration plus the current ans value, n is an integer equal to the input value and must be greater than 1, l is a string equal to the input value, lst is a list containing the elements of l split by spaces, ans is increased by the minimum of the first two elements of lst, and stdin contains t-8 inputs: t-8 test cases if lst had exactly 2 elements, or t-7 inputs: t-7 test cases if lst had a length not equal to 2. If lst had exactly 2 elements, lst remains unchanged. If lst had a length not equal to 2, the first two elements of lst are removed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is at least `n * 2 + 4`, `i` is `n * 2 + 3`, `ans_f` is a list containing `ans` at least the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` in each iteration plus the current `ans` value, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and must be greater than 1, `l` is a string equal to the input value, `lst` is a list containing the elements of `l` split by spaces, `ans` is increased by the minimum of the first two elements of `lst`, and `stdin` contains `t-8` inputs: `t-8` test cases if `lst` had exactly 2 elements, or `t-7` inputs: `t-7` test cases if `lst` had a length not equal to 2. If `lst` had exactly 2 elements, `lst` remains unchanged. If `lst` had a length not equal to 2, the first two elements of `lst` are removed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
