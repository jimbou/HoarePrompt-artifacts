The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n` * 2, `t` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is `n` * 2 + 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than `n` * 2 + 1.
State: **`t` is at least `n` * 2 + 2, `i` is `n` * 2 + 1, `ans_f` is a list containing `ans` at least the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` in each iteration, `ans` is at least the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` in each iteration, `n` is an integer, `l` is a string, `lst` is an empty list, stdin contains `t-2` inputs: `t-2` test cases.**
