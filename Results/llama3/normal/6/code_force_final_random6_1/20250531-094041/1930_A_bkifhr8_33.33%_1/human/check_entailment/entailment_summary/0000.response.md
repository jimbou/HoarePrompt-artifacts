Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by iterating through the list of integers and adding the minimum of each pair to the score. However, there are a few issues with the implementation:

1. The program is not sorting the list of integers before pairing them up. This means that the program is not guaranteed to find the optimal solution, as it's not pairing up the smallest numbers first.

2. The program is removing elements from the list while iterating over it, which can lead to incorrect results. 

3. The program is using `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` to remove the paired elements, which is incorrect. This will remove the first and third elements of the list, not the paired elements.

4. The program is using a break statement when the length of the list is 2, which is not necessary.

Correctness: **False**
