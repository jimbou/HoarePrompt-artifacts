The code prints the next element in the list `ans_f`.
Since the exact elements of the list `ans_f` are not provided, we can't determine the exact value of `i`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the next element in the list `ans_f`.
Output: **the next element in the list ans_f**
