Output State: **t is at least n * 2 + 3, i is n * 2 + 1, ans_f is a list containing ans at least the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of lst in each iteration plus the current ans value, n is an integer equal to the input value, l is a string equal to the input value, lst is a list containing the elements of l split by spaces, and stdin contains t-5 inputs: t-5 test cases.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, with the only difference being that the value of `i` has been incremented by `n * 2` and the value of `ans` has been increased by the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` in each iteration. The other variables remain unchanged.
