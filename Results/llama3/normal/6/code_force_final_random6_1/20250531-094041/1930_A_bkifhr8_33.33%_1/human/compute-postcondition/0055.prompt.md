Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 5000, ans_f is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 inputs: t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_2n (1 <= a_i <= 10^7).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    ans = 0
    n = int(input())
    l = input()
    lst = l.split(' ')
    for i in range(n * 2):
        if len(lst) != 2:
            ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
            lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
            lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
        else:
            ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
            break
    ans_f.append(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is at least 1, `i` is `n` * 2, `ans_f` is a list containing `ans` at least the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` in each iteration, `ans` is at least the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` in each iteration, `n` is an integer, `l` is a string, `lst` is an empty list, stdin contains `t-2` inputs: `t-2` test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is at least `n * 2 + 2`, `i` is `n * 2`, `ans_f` is a list containing `ans` at least the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` in each iteration plus the current `ans` value, `n` is an integer equal to the input value, `l` is a string equal to the input value, `lst` is an empty list, and `stdin` contains `t-3` inputs: `t-3` test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is at least `n * 2 + 3`, `i` is `n * 2 + 1`, `ans_f` is a list containing `ans` at least the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` in each iteration plus the current `ans` value plus the last calculated `ans` value, `n` is an integer equal to the input value, `l` is a string equal to the input value, `lst` is a list containing the elements of `l` split by spaces, and stdin contains `t-5` inputs: `t-5` test cases.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
