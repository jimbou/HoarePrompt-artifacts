The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n * 2`, `t` is at least `n * 2 + 2`. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is `n * 2 + 1` and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than `n * 2 + 1`.
State: **`t` is at least `n * 2 + 3`, `i` is `n * 2 + 1`, `ans_f` is a list containing `ans` at least the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` in each iteration plus the current `ans` value, `n` is an integer equal to the input value, `l` is a string equal to the input value, `lst` is an empty list, and `stdin` contains `t-4` inputs: `t-4` test cases.**
