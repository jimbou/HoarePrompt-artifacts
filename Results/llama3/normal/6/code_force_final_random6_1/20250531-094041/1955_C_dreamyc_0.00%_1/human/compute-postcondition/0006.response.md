Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `k` is a positive integer, `nums` is a deque of `n-2` positive integers, `ans` is 0, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer equal to the minimum of `a` and `b`, and `k` is less than 2 times `x`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables remain the same as in the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. This means that the execution of the program will continue from the next statement outside the loop or if statement that we broke out of.
