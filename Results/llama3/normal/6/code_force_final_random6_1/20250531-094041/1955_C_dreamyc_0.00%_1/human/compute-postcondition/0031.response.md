Output State: **n is at least 3, k is greater than 0 and at least 2x less than its original value, nums is a deque of at least 0 positive integers, a is a positive integer equal to its original value minus x, b is a positive integer equal to its original value minus x, x is a positive integer equal to the minimum of a and b.**

The code block modifies the values of `a`, `b`, and `k` by subtracting `x` from `a` and `b`, and subtracting `2x` from `k`. The value of `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`, which means it is a positive integer. The value of `n` is not affected by the code and remains at least 3. The value of `nums` is also not affected and remains a deque of at least 0 positive integers.
