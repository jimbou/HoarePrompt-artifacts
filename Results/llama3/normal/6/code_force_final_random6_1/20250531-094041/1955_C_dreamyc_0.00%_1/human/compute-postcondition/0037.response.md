Output State: **n is at least 3, k is greater than 0, nums is a deque of at least 1 positive integers, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, x is a positive integer equal to the minimum of a and b. If a is greater than 0, then if k is at least 2 times x, k is reduced by at least 2x, a is reduced by x, and b is reduced by x. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If a is not greater than 0, then ans is increased by 1, and if k is at least 2 times x, then k is reduced by at least 2x, a is reduced by x, and b is reduced by x. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only change being that the deque `nums` now has at least 1 positive integer, which is the value of `b` that was appended to it. All other variables and conditions remain the same.
