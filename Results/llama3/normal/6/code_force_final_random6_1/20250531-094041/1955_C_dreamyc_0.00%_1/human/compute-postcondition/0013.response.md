Postcondition: ***n is at least 2, k is a positive integer, nums is a deque of n-2 or n-1 positive integers. a is either a positive integer or 0, and the current value of a is either a positive integer or 0. b is a positive integer and the current value of b is greater than 0. x is a positive integer equal to the minimum of a and b. If a is greater than 0, then if k is greater than or equal to 2 times x, then a and b are decreased by x. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If a is 0, then ans is 1, and x is 0.***
