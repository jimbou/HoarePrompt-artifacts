Postcondition: **n is at least 3, k is greater than 0, nums is a deque of at least 0 positive integers, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, x is a positive integer equal to the minimum of a and b. If b > 0, then if a is greater than 0, then if k is at least 2 times x, k is reduced by at least 2x, a is reduced by x, and b is reduced by x. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If a is not greater than 0, then ans is increased by 1, and if k is at least 2 times x, then k is reduced by at least 2x, a is reduced by x, and b is reduced by x. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If b is not greater than 0, then ans is increased by 1. If a is greater than 0, then if k is at least 2 times x, k is reduced by at least 2x, a is reduced by x, and b is reduced by x. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If a is not greater than 0, then if k is at least 2 times x, then k is reduced by at least 2x, a is reduced by x, and b is reduced by x.
