Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `nums` is a deque of at least 0 positive integers, `a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `x` is a positive integer equal to the minimum of `a` and `b`, `ans` is increased by 1. If `k` is greater than or equal to twice `x`, `a` is decreased by `x`, `b` is decreased by `x`, and `k` is decreased by twice `x`. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is increased by 1. The values of `n`, `k`, `nums`, `a`, `b`, and `x` remain the same as in the initial state. The relationship between `a`, `b`, `x`, and `k` is still valid, meaning that if `k` is greater than or equal to twice `x`, `a` and `b` are decreased by `x`, and `k` is decreased by twice `x`. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
