Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `k` is greater than 0, `nums` is a deque of at least 0 positive integers, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer equal to the minimum of `a` and `b`, `ans` is increased by 1. If `a` is greater than 0, then if `k` is at least 2 times `x`, `k` is reduced by at least 2x, `a` is reduced by `x`, and `b` is reduced by `x`. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a` is not greater than 0, then if `k` is at least 2 times `x`, then `k` is reduced by at least 2x, `a` is reduced by `x`, and `b` is reduced by `x`. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions related to `a`, `k`, and `x` still apply.
