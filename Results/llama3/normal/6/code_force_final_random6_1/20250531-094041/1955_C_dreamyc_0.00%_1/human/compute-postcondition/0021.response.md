Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `k` is greater than 0, `nums` is a deque of at least 0 positive integers, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer equal to the minimum of `a` and `b`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The variables `n`, `k`, `nums`, `a`, `b`, and `x` retain their original values and properties, and no new variables are introduced. The only change is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement, but the program continues to execute from the next line of code.
