Output State: **n is at least 2, k is a positive integer, nums is a deque of n-2 positive integers, ans is 0, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, x is a positive integer equal to the minimum of a and b**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains at least 2, and `k` remains a positive integer. The deque `nums` now contains `n-2` positive integers, as two elements have been removed. The variable `ans` remains 0. The variables `a` and `b` have been assigned the values of the removed elements from the deque `nums`, and `x` has been assigned the minimum value between `a` and `b`.
