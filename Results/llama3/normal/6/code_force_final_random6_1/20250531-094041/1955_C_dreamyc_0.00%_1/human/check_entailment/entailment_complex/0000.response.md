Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to simulate the Kraken's attack on the ships. The program uses a deque to efficiently remove and add elements from the beginning and end of the list. It also correctly handles the case where there is only one ship left and the Kraken's attack is greater than or equal to the durability of that ship.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly returns the number of ships that were sunk after the Kraken's attack. The use of a deque and the while loop ensures that the program runs efficiently, even for large inputs.

Correctness: **True**
