Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, nums is a deque of n positive integers, ans is 0**

The code snippet converts the list `nums` into a deque (double-ended queue) and initializes a new variable `ans` to 0. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The deque `nums` now allows for efficient append and pop operations from both ends, but its contents remain the same as the original list. The variable `ans` is introduced with an initial value of 0, ready to be used in subsequent operations.
