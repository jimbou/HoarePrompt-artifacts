Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `nums` is a deque of at least 0 positive integers, `a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `x` is a positive integer equal to the minimum of `a` and `b`, `ans` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been increased by 1, while the values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The conditions that were true in the initial state, such as `n` being at least 3, `k` being greater than or equal to 0, and `x` being equal to the minimum of `a` and `b`, are still true in the output state.
