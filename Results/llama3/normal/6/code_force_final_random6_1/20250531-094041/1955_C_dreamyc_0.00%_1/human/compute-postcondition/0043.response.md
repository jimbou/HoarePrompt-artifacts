Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, k is 0, nums is a deque of at least 0 positive integers, ans is a non-negative integer. Additionally, the following condition is false: (k and len(nums) == 1 and (k >= nums[0])), which means either k is 0, or the length of nums is not 1, or k is less than the first element of nums***
