To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `k` and `nums` since they are the variables in the loop head.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is not zero and `len(nums)` is at least 2.

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is a positive integer, and `nums` is a deque of `n-2` or `n-1` positive integers. Since `n` is at least 2, `nums` can have at least 2 elements if `n` is at least 3.

However, to ensure the loop can execute again, we need to guarantee that `k` is not zero and `len(nums)` is at least 2. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `k` to be greater than 0 and the state of `nums` to be a deque of at least 2 positive integers.

State: **n is at least 3, k is greater than 0, nums is a deque of at least 2 positive integers, a is either a positive integer or 0, b is either a positive integer or 0, x is a positive integer equal to the minimum of a and b.**
