Output State: **n is at least 3, k is greater than 0, nums is a deque of at least 1 positive integers, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, x is a positive integer equal to the minimum of a and b. If k is at least 2 times x, then k is reduced by at least 2x, a is reduced by x, and b is reduced by x. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code adds the value of `a` to the left of the deque `nums`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The state of the program remains the same, with the additional information that `nums` now contains at least one positive integer, which is the value of `a`.
