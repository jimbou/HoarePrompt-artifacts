Postcondition: ***n is at least 3, k is greater than or equal to 0, nums is a deque of at least 0 positive integers, a is a non-negative integer, b is a non-negative integer, x is a positive integer equal to the minimum of a and b. If k is greater than or equal to twice x, a is decreased by x, b is decreased by x, and k is decreased by twice x. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
