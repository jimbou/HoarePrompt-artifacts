Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly simulates the Kraken's attack on the ships and counts the number of ships sunk.

The program uses a deque to efficiently remove and add ships from the front and back of the queue. It iteratively attacks the ships from both ends, reducing their durability by 1 each time. If a ship's durability drops to 0, it is removed from the queue and counted as sunk.

The program also correctly handles the case where there is only one ship left and the Kraken still has attacks remaining. In this case, it checks if the remaining attacks are enough to sink the last ship and increments the count of sunk ships accordingly.

The program's logic is sound, and it should produce the correct output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
