Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `k` is a positive integer, `nums` is a deque of n-1 positive integers with `a` as the first element, `ans` is 0, `a` is a positive integer greater than 0, `b` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer equal to the minimum of `a` and `b`. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2 times `x`, then the current value of `a` and `b` are decreased by `x`. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still at least 2, `k` is still a positive integer, `nums` is now a deque of n-1 positive integers with `a` added to the front, `ans` remains 0, `a` and `b` are still positive integers, and `x` is still the minimum of `a` and `b`. The relationship between `k`, `a`, `b`, and `x` remains the same, and the program may or may not have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement depending on the value of `k`.
