Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `k` is greater than 0, `nums` is a deque of at least 0 positive integers, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer equal to the minimum of `a` and `b`, `ans` is increased by 1, If `k` is at least 2 times `x`, then `k` is reduced by at least 2x, `a` is reduced by `x`, and `b` is reduced by `x`. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged, with `n` still being at least 3, `k` still being greater than 0, `nums` still being a deque of at least 0 positive integers, `a` and `b` still being positive integers, and `x` still being the minimum of `a` and `b`. Additionally, if `k` is at least 2 times `x`, then `k`, `a`, and `b` are reduced by at least 2x, x, and x respectively. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
