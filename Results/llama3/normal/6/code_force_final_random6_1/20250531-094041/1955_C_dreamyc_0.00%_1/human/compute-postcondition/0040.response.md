Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is 0, nums is a deque of at least 0 positive integers, ans is a non-negative integer.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `n` remains unchanged, `k` becomes 0, the deque `nums` may contain any number of positive integers (including 0), and the value of `ans` is a non-negative integer. This state reflects the fact that the loop continues to execute until `k` is reduced to 0, at which point the loop terminates. The values of `a`, `b`, and `x` are no longer relevant as they are only used within the loop.
