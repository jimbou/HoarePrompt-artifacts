Postcondition: **n is at least 2, k is a positive integer, nums is a deque of n-2 positive integers, ans is 0, a is a positive integer greater than 0, b is a positive integer, x is a positive integer equal to the minimum of a and b. If k is greater than or equal to 2 times x, then the current value of a and b are decreased by x. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
