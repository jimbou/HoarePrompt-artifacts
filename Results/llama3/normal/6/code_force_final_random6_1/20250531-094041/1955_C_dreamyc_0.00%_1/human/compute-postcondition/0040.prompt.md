Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, nums is a deque of n positive integers, ans is 0
Code of the loop:
while k and len(nums) >= 2:
    a, b = nums.popleft(), nums.pop()
    x = min(a, b)
    if k >= 2 * x:
        a -= x
        b -= x
        k -= 2 * x
    else:
        break
    if a > 0:
        nums.appendleft(a)
    else:
        ans += 1
    if b > 0:
        nums.append(b)
    else:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is at least 2, k is a positive integer, nums is a deque of n-2 or n-1 positive integers. a is either a positive integer or 0, b is either a positive integer or 0, x is a positive integer equal to the minimum of a and b. If a is greater than 0, then if k is greater than or equal to 2 times x, then a and b are decreased by x. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If a is 0, then ans is either 1 or 2, and x is 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`n` is at least 3, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `nums` is a deque of at least 0 positive integers, `a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `x` is a positive integer equal to the minimum of `a` and `b`. If `b` is greater than 0, then if `a` is greater than 0 and `k` is greater than or equal to twice `x`, `a` is decreased by `x`, `b` is decreased by `x`, and `k` is decreased by twice `x`. If `a` is 0, `ans` is increased by 1. If `k` is less than twice `x`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `b` is 0, `ans` is increased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: n is at least 3, k is greater than 0, nums is a deque of at least 0 positive integers, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, x is a positive integer equal to the minimum of a and b. If b > 0, then if a is greater than 0, then if k is at least 2 times x, k is reduced by at least 2x, a is reduced by x, and b is reduced by x. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If a is not greater than 0, then ans is increased by 1, and if k is at least 2 times x, then k is reduced by at least 2x, a is reduced by x, and b is reduced by x. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If b is not greater than 0, then ans is increased by 1. If a is greater than 0, then if k is at least 2 times x, k is reduced by at least 2x, a is reduced by x, and b is reduced by x. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If a is not greater than 0, then if k is at least 2 times x, then k is reduced by at least 2x, a is reduced by x, and b is reduced by x. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
