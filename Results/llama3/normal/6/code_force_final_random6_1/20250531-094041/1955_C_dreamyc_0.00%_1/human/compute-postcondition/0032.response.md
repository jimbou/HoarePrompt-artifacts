Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `k` is greater than 0, `nums` is a deque of at least 0 positive integers, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer equal to the minimum of `a` and `b`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all the variables maintain their initial values and properties, as the `break` statement only terminates the execution of the innermost loop or if statement, without modifying any variable values.
