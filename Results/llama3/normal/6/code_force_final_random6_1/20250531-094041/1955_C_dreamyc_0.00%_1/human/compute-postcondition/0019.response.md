Output State: **n is at least 3, k is greater than 0, nums is a deque of at least 0 positive integers, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, x is a positive integer equal to the minimum of a and b.**

The code snippet first assigns the leftmost element of the deque `nums` to `a` and the rightmost element to `b`. Since `nums` initially contains at least 2 positive integers, both `a` and `b` become positive integers. The second line updates the value of `x` to be the minimum of `a` and `b`, ensuring that `x` is a positive integer. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the code. The deque `nums` is modified, but it still contains at least 0 positive integers.
