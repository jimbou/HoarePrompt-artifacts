The code snippet provided modifies the values of `a`, `b`, and `k` based on the value of `x`. Since `x` is equal to the minimum of `a` and `b`, and both `a` and `b` are positive integers, `x` is also a positive integer.

The first line, `a -= x`, subtracts the value of `x` from `a`. Since `a` is a positive integer and `x` is also a positive integer, the result of this subtraction is a non-negative integer.

The second line, `b -= x`, subtracts the value of `x` from `b`. Similarly, since `b` is a positive integer and `x` is also a positive integer, the result of this subtraction is a non-negative integer.

The third line, `k -= 2 * x`, subtracts twice the value of `x` from `k`. Since `k` is greater than 0 and `x` is a positive integer, the result of this subtraction is a non-negative integer.

After executing all three lines, the values of `a`, `b`, and `k` are updated as follows:

* `a` is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus `x`.
* `b` is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus `x`.
* `k` is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus twice `x`.

The values of `n`, `nums`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **a is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus x, b is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus x, k is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus twice x, n is at least 3, nums is a deque of at least 0 positive integers, x is a positive integer equal to the minimum of a and b.**
