Output State: **n is at least 3, k is greater than 0, nums is a deque of at least 0 positive integers, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, x is a positive integer equal to the minimum of a and b.**

The code first removes the leftmost and rightmost elements from the deque `nums` and assigns them to `a` and `b`, respectively. Since `nums` initially contained at least 2 positive integers, `a` and `b` are now positive integers. The second line updates the value of `x` to be the minimum of `a` and `b`, which is also a positive integer. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
