To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `k` and `len(nums)`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `len(nums)`. If `k` is greater than 0 and `len(nums)` is greater than or equal to 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is greater than or equal to 0 and `len(nums)` is at least 0.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `k` must be greater than 0 and `len(nums)` must be greater than or equal to 2. 

State: **`n` is at least 3, `k` is greater than 0, `nums` is a deque of at least 2 positive integers, `a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `x` is a positive integer equal to the minimum of `a` and `b`.**
