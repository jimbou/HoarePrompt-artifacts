Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `nums` is a deque of at least 1 positive integers, `a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `x` is a positive integer equal to the minimum of `a` and `b`. If `k` is greater than or equal to twice `x`, `a` is decreased by `x`, `b` is decreased by `x`, and `k` is decreased by twice `x`. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The value of `nums` has been changed by appending `a` to the left of the deque. The values of the other variables are not affected. The program does not break out of the most internal loop or if statement because the given code does not contain a break statement.
