Postcondition: **t is a positive integer and must be greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, k is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^9, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, x is a list of n integers between -n and n, monsters is a sorted list of tuples containing x and a values and must have at least 3 tuples, bullets_used is equal to the sum of the initial bullets_used and the third a value in the sorted list of tuples, pos is the third x value in the sorted list of tuples, health is the third a value in the sorted list of tuples, distance is the absolute value of the third x value in the sorted list of tuples, total_bullets_needed is the sum of the updated bullets_used and the third a value in the sorted list of tuples, and can_survive is False if total_bullets_needed is higher than the product of the absolute value of the third x value in the sorted list of tuples and k, otherwise can_survive remains True.**
