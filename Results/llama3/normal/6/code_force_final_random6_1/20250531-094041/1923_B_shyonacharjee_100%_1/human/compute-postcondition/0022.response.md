Output: **t is a positive integer and must be greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, k is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^9, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, x is a list of n integers between -n and n, monsters is an empty list, bullets_used is equal to the sum of the initial bullets_used and all the a values in the sorted list of tuples, pos is the last x value in the sorted list of tuples, health is the last a value in the sorted list of tuples, distance is the absolute value of the last x value in the sorted list of tuples, total_bullets_needed is the sum of the updated bullets_used and the last a value in the sorted list of tuples, and can_survive is False if total_bullets_needed is higher than the product of the absolute value of the last x value in the sorted list of tuples and k, otherwise can_survive remains True, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and 'YES' is printed if can_survive is True, otherwise 'NO' is printed**
