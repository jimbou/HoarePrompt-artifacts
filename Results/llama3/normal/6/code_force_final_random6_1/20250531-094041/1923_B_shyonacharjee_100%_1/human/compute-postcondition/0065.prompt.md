Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three lines: the first line contains two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, 1 <= k <= 2 * 10^9), the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), and the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_n (-n <= x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < ... < x_n <= n; x_i != 0). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    monsters = sorted(zip(x, a), key=lambda p: abs(p[0]))
    bullets_used = 0
    can_survive = True
    for pos, health in monsters:
        distance = abs(pos)
        total_bullets_needed = bullets_used + health
        if total_bullets_needed > distance * k:
            can_survive = False
            break
        bullets_used += health
    print('YES' if can_survive else 'NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer and must be greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, k is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^9, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, x is a list of n integers between -n and n, monsters is an empty list, bullets_used is equal to the sum of the initial bullets_used and all the a values in the sorted list of tuples, pos is the last x value in the sorted list of tuples, health is the last a value in the sorted list of tuples, distance is the absolute value of the last x value in the sorted list of tuples, total_bullets_needed is the sum of the updated bullets_used and the last a value in the sorted list of tuples, and can_survive is False if total_bullets_needed is higher than the product of the absolute value of the last x value in the sorted list of tuples and k, otherwise can_survive remains True, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and 'YES' is printed if can_survive is True, otherwise 'NO' is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer and must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^9, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `x` is a list of `n` integers between -`n` and `n`, `monsters` is an empty list, `bullets_used` is the sum of all `a` values in the sorted list of tuples, `can_survive` is False if `total_bullets_needed` is greater than the product of `distance` and `k`, otherwise `can_survive` is True, `pos` is the last `x` value in the sorted list of tuples, `health` is the last `a` value in the sorted list of tuples, `distance` is the absolute value of the last `x` value in the sorted list of tuples, `total_bullets_needed` is the sum of the updated `bullets_used` and the last `a` value in the sorted list of tuples, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and this is printed: 'YES' if `can_survive` is True, otherwise 'NO'

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, k is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^9, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, x is a list of n integers between -n and n, monsters is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, bullets_used is the sum of the health of all monsters, can_survive is False if the total bullets needed to kill any monster is greater than the product of the distance to that monster and k, otherwise can_survive is True, and this is printed: 'YES' if can_survive is True, otherwise 'NO'




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
