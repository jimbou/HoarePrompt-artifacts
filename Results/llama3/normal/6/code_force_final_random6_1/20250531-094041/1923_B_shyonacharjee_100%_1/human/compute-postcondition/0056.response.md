Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^9, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `x` is a list of `n` integers between -`n` and `n`, `monsters` is a list of at least 2 tuples containing `x` and `a` values sorted by the absolute value of `x`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the second monster, `bullets_used` is increased by the health of the second monster, `total_bullets_needed` is the sum of the updated `bullets_used` and the health of the first monster, `pos` is the position of the second monster, `health` is the health of the second monster. If `total_bullets_needed` is greater than the product of `distance` and `k`, then `can_survive` is False. Otherwise, `can_survive` remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of elements, the maximum number of bullets that can be used, the list of strengths, the list of positions, and the list of monsters remain unchanged. The standard input contains two fewer test cases. The distance to the second monster, the position of the second monster, and its health are also unchanged. However, the number of bullets used is increased by the health of the second monster. The total number of bullets needed is updated accordingly. The ability to survive depends on whether the total number of bullets needed exceeds the product of the distance and the maximum number of bullets that can be used.
