The code prints 'YES' if the total bullets needed to survive is less than or equal to the product of the absolute value of the last x value in the sorted list of tuples and k, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The total bullets needed to survive is the sum of the updated bullets used and the last a value in the sorted list of tuples. The updated bullets used is the sum of the initial bullets used and all the a values in the sorted list of tuples. The last x value in the sorted list of tuples is the last element in the sorted list of tuples, and the last a value in the sorted list of tuples is the last element in the sorted list of tuples.

Output: **YES if total_bullets_needed is less than or equal to the product of the absolute value of the last x value in the sorted list of tuples and k, otherwise NO**
