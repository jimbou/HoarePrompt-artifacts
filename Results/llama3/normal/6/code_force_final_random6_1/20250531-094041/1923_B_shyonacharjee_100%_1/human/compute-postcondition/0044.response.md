State: **`t` is a positive integer and must be greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^9, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `x` is a list of `n` integers between -`n` and `n`, `monsters` is an empty list, `bullets_used` is the sum of all `a` values in the sorted list of tuples, `can_survive` is False if `total_bullets_needed` is greater than the product of `distance` and `k`, otherwise `can_survive` is True, `pos` is the last `x` value in the sorted list of tuples, `health` is the last `a` value in the sorted list of tuples, `distance` is the absolute value of the last `x` value in the sorted list of tuples, `total_bullets_needed` is the sum of the updated `bullets_used` and the last `a` value in the sorted list of tuples, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, and this is printed: 'YES' if `can_survive` is True, otherwise 'NO'**
