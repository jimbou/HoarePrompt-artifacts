Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer and must be greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, k is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^9, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, x is a list of n integers between -n and n, monsters is a sorted list of tuples containing x and a values, bullets_used is 0, can_survive is True, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.
Code of the loop:
for pos, health in monsters:
    distance = abs(pos)
    total_bullets_needed = bullets_used + health
    if total_bullets_needed > distance * k:
        can_survive = False
        break
    bullets_used += health


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer and must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^9, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `x` is a list of `n` integers between -`n` and `n`, `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples containing `x` and `a` values and must have at least one tuple, `bullets_used` is equal to the sum of the initial `bullets_used` and `health`, `pos` is the first `x` value in the sorted list of tuples, `health` is the first `a` value in the sorted list of tuples, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`, `total_bullets_needed` is the sum of the updated `bullets_used` and `health`, and if `total_bullets_needed` is higher than the product of `distance` and `k`, then `can_survive` is False. Otherwise, `can_survive` remains True, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer and must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^9, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `x` is a list of `n` integers between -`n` and `n`, `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples containing `x` and `a` values and must have at least 2 tuples, `bullets_used` is equal to the sum of the initial `bullets_used` and the second `a` value in the sorted list of tuples, `pos` is the second `x` value in the sorted list of tuples, `health` is the second `a` value in the sorted list of tuples, `distance` is the absolute value of the second `x` value in the sorted list of tuples, `total_bullets_needed` is the sum of the updated `bullets_used` and the second `a` value in the sorted list of tuples, and `can_survive` is False if `total_bullets_needed` is higher than the product of the absolute value of the second `x` value in the sorted list of tuples and `k`, otherwise `can_survive` remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer and must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^9, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `x` is a list of `n` integers between -`n` and `n`, `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples containing `x` and `a` values and must have at least 3 tuples, `bullets_used` is equal to the sum of the initial bullets_used and twice the third `a` value in the sorted list of tuples, `pos` is the third `x` value in the sorted list of tuples, `health` is the third `a` value in the sorted list of tuples, `distance` is the absolute value of the third `x` value in the sorted list of tuples, `total_bullets_needed` is the sum of the updated bullets_used and the third `a` value in the sorted list of tuples, and `can_survive` is False if total_bullets_needed is higher than the product of the absolute value of the third `x` value in the sorted list of tuples and `k`, otherwise `can_survive` remains True.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
