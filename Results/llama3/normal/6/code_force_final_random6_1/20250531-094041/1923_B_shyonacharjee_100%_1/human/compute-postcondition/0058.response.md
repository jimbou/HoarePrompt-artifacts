Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, k is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^9, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, x is a list of n integers between -n and n, monsters is a list of at least 3 tuples containing x and a values sorted by the absolute value of x, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, distance is the absolute value of the position of the third monster, bullets_used is increased by the health of the third monster, total_bullets_needed is the sum of the updated bullets_used and the health of the first monster, pos is the position of the third monster, health is the health of the third monster, can_survive is False if total_bullets_needed is greater than the product of distance and k, otherwise can_survive remains unchanged.**
