Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^9, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `x` is a list of `n` integers between -`n` and `n`, `monsters` is a list of at least 3 tuples containing `x` and `a` values sorted by the absolute value of `x`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the third monster, `bullets_used` is increased by the health of the third monster, `total_bullets_needed` is the sum of the updated `bullets_used` and the health of the first monster, `pos` is the position of the third monster, `health` is the health of the third monster, if `total_bullets_needed` is greater than the product of `distance` and `k`, then `can_survive` is False, otherwise `can_survive` remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of monsters, the maximum allowed bullets, the list of monster's health, the list of monster's positions, and the list of monsters with their positions and health are unchanged. The standard input contains multiple test cases minus two. The distance to the third monster, the position of the third monster, and the health of the third monster are unchanged. The total bullets used is increased by the health of the third monster. The total bullets needed is the sum of the updated bullets used and the health of the first monster. The ability to survive depends on whether the total bullets needed is greater than the product of the distance and the maximum allowed bullets.
