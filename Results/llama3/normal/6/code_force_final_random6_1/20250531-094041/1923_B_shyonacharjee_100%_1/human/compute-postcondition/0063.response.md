The code prints 'YES' if the total bullets needed to kill any monster is less than or equal to the product of the distance to that monster and k, otherwise it prints 'NO'. Here, the total bullets needed to kill any monster is the sum of the health of all monsters, and the distance to that monster is the value of x, and k is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^9.
Output: **YES if bullets_used is less than or equal to the product of x and k, otherwise NO**
