The code prints 'YES' if the total bullets needed to kill any monster is less than or equal to the product of the distance to that monster and k, otherwise it prints 'NO'. Where n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, k is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^9, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, x is a list of n integers between -n and n, monsters is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, bullets_used is the sum of the health of all monsters.
Output: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, k is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^9, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, x is a list of n integers between -n and n, monsters is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, bullets_used is the sum of the health of all monsters, can_survive is False if the total bullets needed to kill any monster is greater than the product of the distance to that monster and k, otherwise can_survive is True, and this is printed: 'YES' if can_survive is True, otherwise 'NO'**
