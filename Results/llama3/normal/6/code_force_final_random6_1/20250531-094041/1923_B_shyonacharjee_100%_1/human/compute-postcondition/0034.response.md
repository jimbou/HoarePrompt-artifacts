Postcondition: **t is a positive integer and must be greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, k is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^9, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, x is a list of n integers between -n and n, monsters is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the x values that must have at least 2 monsters, bullets_used is the sum of the previous bullets_used and the first a value in the sorted list of tuples, if total_bullets_needed is greater than the product of distance and k, then can_survive is False, otherwise can_survive is True if the sum of the updated bullets_used and the first a value in the sorted list of tuples is less than or equal to the product of the absolute value of the first x value in the sorted list of tuples and k, pos is the second x value in the sorted list of tuples, health is the second a value in the sorted list of tuples, distance is the absolute value of the second x value in the sorted list of tuples, total_bullets_needed is the sum of the updated bullets_used and the first a value in the sorted list of tuples, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**
