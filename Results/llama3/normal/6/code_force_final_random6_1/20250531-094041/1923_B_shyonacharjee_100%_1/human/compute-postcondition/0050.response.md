Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, k is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^9, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, x is a list of n integers between -n and n, monsters is a list of at least 1 tuple containing x and a values sorted by the absolute value of x, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, pos is the position of the first monster, health is the health of the first monster, distance is the absolute value of pos, total_bullets_needed is the sum of bullets_used and health. If total_bullets_needed is greater than the product of distance and k, then can_survive is False. Otherwise, the value of can_survive remains unchanged.***
