Output State: **`t` is a positive integer and must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^9, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `x` is a list of `n` integers between -`n` and `n`, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the `x` values that must have at least 3 monsters, `bullets_used` is the sum of the previous `bullets_used` and the third `a` value in the sorted list of tuples, `can_survive` is False if `total_bullets_needed` is greater than the product of `distance` and `k`, otherwise `can_survive` is True if the sum of the updated `bullets_used` and the first `a` value in the sorted list of tuples is less than or equal to the product of the absolute value of the first `x` value in the sorted list of tuples and `k`, `pos` is the third `x` value in the sorted list of tuples, `health` is the third `a` value in the sorted list of tuples, `distance` is the absolute value of the third `x` value in the sorted list of tuples, `total_bullets_needed` is the sum of the updated `bullets_used` and the first `a` value in the sorted list of tuples, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `bullets_used` has been updated to include the third `a` value in the sorted list of tuples, which is also the current `health` value. The other variables remain unchanged.
