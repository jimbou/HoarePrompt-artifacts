This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three lines: two integers n and k, a list of n integers a, and a list of n integers x. It then determines whether it is possible to survive a series of monster attacks based on the given parameters. The function prints 'YES' if survival is possible and 'NO' otherwise.
