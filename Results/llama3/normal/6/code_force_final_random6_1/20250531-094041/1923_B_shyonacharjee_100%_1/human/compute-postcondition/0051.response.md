Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^9, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `x` is a list of `n` integers between -`n` and `n`, `monsters` is a list of at least 1 tuple containing `x` and `a` values sorted by the absolute value of `x`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `pos` is the position of the first monster, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`, `bullets_used` is increased by the health of the first monster, `total_bullets_needed` is the sum of the updated `bullets_used` and the health of the first monster, if `total_bullets_needed` is greater than the product of `distance` and `k`, then `can_survive` is False, otherwise `can_survive` remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `bullets_used` has been increased by the health of the first monster, which affects the value of `total_bullets_needed`. The value of `can_survive` is updated based on the comparison between `total_bullets_needed` and the product of `distance` and `k`. All other variables remain unchanged.
