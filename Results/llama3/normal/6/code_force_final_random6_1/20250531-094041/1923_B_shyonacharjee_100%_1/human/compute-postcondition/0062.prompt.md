Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, k is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^9, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, x is a list of n integers between -n and n, monsters is a list of n tuples containing x and a values sorted by the absolute value of x, bullets_used is 0, can_survive is True, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, and 'YES' or 'NO' is printed based on the value of can_survive.
Code of the loop:
for pos, health in monsters:
    distance = abs(pos)
    total_bullets_needed = bullets_used + health
    if total_bullets_needed > distance * k:
        can_survive = False
        break
    bullets_used += health


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^9, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `x` is a list of `n` integers between -`n` and `n`, `monsters` is a list of at least 1 tuple containing `x` and `a` values sorted by the absolute value of `x`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `pos` is the position of the first monster, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`, `bullets_used` is increased by the health of the first monster, `total_bullets_needed` is the sum of the updated `bullets_used` and the health of the first monster, if `total_bullets_needed` is greater than the product of `distance` and `k`, then `can_survive` is False, otherwise `can_survive` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^9, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `x` is a list of `n` integers between -`n` and `n`, `monsters` is a list of at least 2 tuples containing `x` and `a` values sorted by the absolute value of `x`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the second monster, `bullets_used` is increased by the health of the second monster, `total_bullets_needed` is the sum of the updated `bullets_used` and the health of the first monster, `pos` is the position of the second monster, `health` is the health of the second monster. If `total_bullets_needed` is greater than the product of `distance` and `k`, then `can_survive` is False. Otherwise, `can_survive` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^9, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `x` is a list of `n` integers between -`n` and `n`, `monsters` is a list of at least 3 tuples containing `x` and `a` values sorted by the absolute value of `x`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the third monster, `bullets_used` is increased by the health of the third monster, `total_bullets_needed` is the sum of the updated `bullets_used` and the health of the first monster, `pos` is the position of the third monster, `health` is the health of the third monster, if `total_bullets_needed` is greater than the product of `distance` and `k`, then `can_survive` is False, otherwise `can_survive` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
