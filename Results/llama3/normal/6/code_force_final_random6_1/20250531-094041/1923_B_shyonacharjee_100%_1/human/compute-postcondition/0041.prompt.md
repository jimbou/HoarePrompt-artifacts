Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer and must be greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, k is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^9, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, x is a list of n integers between -n and n, monsters is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the x values, bullets_used is 0, can_survive is True, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and 'YES' is printed if can_survive is True, otherwise 'NO' is printed, pos is the last x value in the sorted list of tuples, health is the last a value in the sorted list of tuples, distance is the absolute value of the last x value in the sorted list of tuples, total_bullets_needed is the sum of the updated bullets_used and the last a value in the sorted list of tuples, and can_survive is False if total_bullets_needed is higher than the product of the absolute value of the last x value in the sorted list of tuples and k, otherwise can_survive remains True.
Code of the loop:
for pos, health in monsters:
    distance = abs(pos)
    total_bullets_needed = bullets_used + health
    if total_bullets_needed > distance * k:
        can_survive = False
        break
    bullets_used += health


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer and must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^9, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `x` is a list of `n` integers between -`n` and `n`, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the `x` values that must have at least 1 monster, `bullets_used` is the sum of the previous `bullets_used` and the first `a` value in the sorted list of tuples, `can_survive` is True if the sum of the updated `bullets_used` and the first `a` value in the sorted list of tuples is less than or equal to the product of the absolute value of the first `x` value in the sorted list of tuples and `k`, otherwise `can_survive` is False, `pos` is the first `x` value in the sorted list of tuples, `health` is the first `a` value in the sorted list of tuples, `distance` is the absolute value of the first `x` value in the sorted list of tuples, `total_bullets_needed` is the sum of the updated `bullets_used` and the first `a` value in the sorted list of tuples, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer and must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^9, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `x` is a list of `n` integers between -`n` and `n`, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the `x` values that must have at least 2 monsters, `bullets_used` is the sum of the previous `bullets_used` and the second `a` value in the sorted list of tuples, `can_survive` is False if `total_bullets_needed` is greater than the product of `distance` and `k`, otherwise `can_survive` is True if the sum of the updated `bullets_used` and the first `a` value in the sorted list of tuples is less than or equal to the product of the absolute value of the first `x` value in the sorted list of tuples and `k`, `pos` is the second `x` value in the sorted list of tuples, `health` is the second `a` value in the sorted list of tuples, `distance` is the absolute value of the second `x` value in the sorted list of tuples, `total_bullets_needed` is the sum of the updated `bullets_used` and the first `a` value in the sorted list of tuples, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer and must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^9, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `x` is a list of `n` integers between -`n` and `n`, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the `x` values that must have at least 3 monsters, `bullets_used` is the sum of the previous `bullets_used` and the third `a` value in the sorted list of tuples, `can_survive` is False if `total_bullets_needed` is greater than the product of `distance` and `k`, otherwise `can_survive` is True if the sum of the updated `bullets_used` and the first `a` value in the sorted list of tuples is less than or equal to the product of the absolute value of the first `x` value in the sorted list of tuples and `k`, `pos` is the third `x` value in the sorted list of tuples, `health` is the third `a` value in the sorted list of tuples, `distance` is the absolute value of the third `x` value in the sorted list of tuples, `total_bullets_needed` is the sum of the updated `bullets_used` and the first `a` value in the sorted list of tuples, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
