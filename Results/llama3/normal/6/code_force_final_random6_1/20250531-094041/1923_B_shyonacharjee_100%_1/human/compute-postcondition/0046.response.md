To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `pos`, `health`, and `monsters`. The loop will execute if `monsters` has at least one tuple containing `pos` and `health` values.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^9, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `x` is a list of `n` integers between -`n` and `n`, `monsters` is a list of at least 1 tuple containing `x` and `a` values sorted by the absolute value of `x`, `bullets_used` is 0, `can_survive` is True, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, and 'YES' or 'NO' is printed based on the value of `can_survive`, `pos` is the position of the first monster, `health` is the health of the first monster**
