Output State: **t is a positive integer and must be greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, k is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^9, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, x is a list of n integers between -n and n, monsters is a sorted list of tuples containing x and a values, bullets_used is 0, can_survive is True, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

The code reads two lines of input for each test case, so stdin now contains one less test case. The first line of the code assigns the values of n and k from the input to the variables n and k. The second line assigns the list of n integers from the input to the variable a. The third line assigns the list of n integers from the input to the variable x. The fourth line sorts the list of tuples containing x and a values based on the absolute value of x and assigns it to the variable monsters. The fifth line initializes the variable bullets_used to 0. The sixth line initializes the variable can_survive to True.
