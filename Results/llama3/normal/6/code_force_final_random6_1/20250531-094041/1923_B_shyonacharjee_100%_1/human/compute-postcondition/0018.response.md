Output State: **`t` is a positive integer and must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `k` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^9, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `x` is a list of `n` integers between -`n` and `n`, `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples containing `x` and `a` values and must have at least 3 tuples, `bullets_used` is equal to the sum of the initial bullets_used and twice the third `a` value in the sorted list of tuples, `pos` is the third `x` value in the sorted list of tuples, `health` is the third `a` value in the sorted list of tuples, `distance` is the absolute value of the third `x` value in the sorted list of tuples, `total_bullets_needed` is the sum of the updated bullets_used and the third `a` value in the sorted list of tuples, and `can_survive` is False if total_bullets_needed is higher than the product of the absolute value of the third `x` value in the sorted list of tuples and `k`, otherwise `can_survive` remains True.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `bullets_used` has been updated to include the value of `health`, which is the third `a` value in the sorted list of tuples. The other variables remain unchanged.
