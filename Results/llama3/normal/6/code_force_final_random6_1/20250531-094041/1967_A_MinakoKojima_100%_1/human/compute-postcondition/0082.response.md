Postcondition: ***`ans_list` contains the value of `ans`, `_` is 1, `n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`, `res` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` plus `k % (i + 1)`, `k` is 0, `i` is 1, and `ans` is increased by 0.***
