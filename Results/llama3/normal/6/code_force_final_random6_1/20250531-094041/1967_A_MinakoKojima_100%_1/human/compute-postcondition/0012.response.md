Output State: **`ans_list` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer that must be at least 2, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `ans` is the smallest integer in `a` plus `k // (i + 1)`, `res` is `n - 1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, `i` is 0, `dif` is `a[1] - a[0]` and `dif` is not 0, and `k` is less than `dif * (i + 1)`**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding `k // (i + 1)` to its initial value, which was the smallest integer in `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that `i` is still 0, so `k // (i + 1)` is equivalent to `k // 1`, which is simply `k`. Therefore, `ans` is now the smallest integer in `a` plus `k`.
