Output State: **`ans_list` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer that must be at least 2, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `ans` is the smallest integer in `a` plus `k // (i + 1)`, `res` is `n - 1 + k % (i + 1)`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, `i` is not 0, `dif` is `a[1] - a[0]` and `dif` is not 0, and `k` is less than `dif * (i + 1)`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `ans_list` is still empty, the variable `_` remains 0, and the positive integer `n` is still at least 2. The positive integer `k` and the sorted list of positive integers `a` also remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is still the smallest integer in `a` plus `k // (i + 1)`. The variable `res` has been updated to `n - 1 + k % (i + 1)`. The standard input `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers. The variable `i` is still not 0, and the difference `dif` between the first two elements of `a` is still not 0. Additionally, `k` is still less than `dif * (i + 1)`.
