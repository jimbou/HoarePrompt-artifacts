Output State: **ans_list is an empty list, _ is 0, n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of positive integers, ans is the smallest integer in a, res is n - 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers.**

The code first reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to `n` and `k`. Then it reads a list of integers from stdin, sorts it in ascending order, and assigns it to `a`. The smallest integer in `a` is assigned to `ans`, and `res` is set to `n - 1`. The value of `_` remains unchanged, and `ans_list` is still an empty list. Stdin now contains multiple test cases minus the two inputs that were read.
