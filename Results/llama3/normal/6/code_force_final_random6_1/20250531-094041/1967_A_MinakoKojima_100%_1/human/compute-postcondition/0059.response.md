Output State: **`ans_list` contains the value of `ans`, `_` is 1, `n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, `i` is 0, `dif` is `a[1] - a[0]` which is 0, `ans` is the smallest integer in `a`, `res` is `n - 2`, and `k` is an integer.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to `n - 2` because the code `res -= 1` decrements the value of `res` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
