Postcondition: ***`ans_list` contains the value of `ans`, `_` is 1, `n` is a positive integer and at least 3, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, `dif` is `a[3] - a[2]`, `res` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `k` is 0, and `i` is 2. If `dif` is 0, `res` is `n - 2` or `n - 3`.***
