Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans_list` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 0 <= k <= 10^12). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^12).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    ans = a[0]
    res = n - 1
    for i in range(n - 1):
        dif = a[i + 1] - a[i]
        if dif == 0:
            res -= 1
        if dif != 0:
            if k >= dif * (i + 1):
                ans += dif
                k -= dif * (i + 1)
                res -= 1
            else:
                ans += k // (i + 1)
                if i != 0:
                    res += k % (i + 1)
                k = 0
                break
            if k == 0:
                break
    if k != 0:
        ans += k // n
        res += k % n
    ans += (ans - 1) * (n - 1)
    ans += res
    ans_list.append(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: ans_list contains the value of ans, _ is 0, n is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of positive integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, i is n - 1, dif is a[1] - a[0] if i is 0, otherwise dif is a[i + 1] - a[i], ans is the smallest integer in a plus the sum of dif if k is greater than or equal to dif times the current value of i, otherwise ans is the smallest integer in a plus the sum of k // (i + 1), res is 0 if k is greater than or equal to dif times the current value of i, otherwise res is n - 1 plus the sum of k modulo i + 1 if i is not 0, otherwise res is n - 1, and k is either increased by k // n and res is increased by k % n, or k remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: ans_list contains the value of ans, _ is 1, n is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of positive integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, dif is a[n - 1] - a[n - 2], res is n - 1 or n - 2 minus the number of times dif is not 0 plus k % n if k is not equal to 0, otherwise res is n - 1 or n - 2 minus the number of times dif is not 0, k is k - k // n - k % n if k is not equal to 0, otherwise k remains unchanged, i is n - 1, and ans is ans + k // n + (ans - 1) * (n - 1) + res if k is not equal to 0, otherwise ans is ans + (ans - 1) * (n - 1) + res.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: ans_list contains the value of ans increased by dif if k is greater than or equal to dif * (i + 1), otherwise ans is increased by k // (i + 1) if i is not equal to 0, otherwise ans is increased by k // (i + 3). If k is not equal to 0, ans_list contains the value of ans increased by k // n. _ is 2, n is a positive integer and must be at least i + 3, a is a sorted list of positive integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, i is n - 1, dif is the difference between the (i+1)th and ith elements of a. If dif is not 0, k is decreased by dif * (i + 1) if k is greater than or equal to dif * (i + 1), otherwise k is 0. res is decreased by 1 if k is greater than or equal to dif * (i + 1), otherwise res is increased by k % (i + 1) if i is not equal to 0. If k is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If dif is 0, then res is decreased by 1. ans is increased by (ans - 1) * (n - 1) and then increased by res.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
