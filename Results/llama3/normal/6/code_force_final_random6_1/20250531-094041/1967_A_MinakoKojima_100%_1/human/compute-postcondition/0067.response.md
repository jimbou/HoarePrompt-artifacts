Output State: **`ans_list` contains the value of `ans`, `_` is 1, `n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, `i` is not 0, `dif` is `a[1] - a[0]`, `ans` is the smallest integer in `a` plus `k // (i + 1)`, `res` is `n - 1 + k % (i + 1)`, and `k` is an integer. The current value of `dif` is not 0. Additionally, `k` is less than `dif * (i + 1)`.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to `n - 1 + k % (i + 1)`, which means it has been incremented by the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
