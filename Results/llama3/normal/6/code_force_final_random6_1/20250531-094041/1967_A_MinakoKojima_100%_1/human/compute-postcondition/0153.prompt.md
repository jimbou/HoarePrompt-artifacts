Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: ans_list contains the value of ans, _ is 2, n is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of positive integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, dif is a[n - 1] - a[n - 2], res is n - 1, k is k - k // n - k % n if k is not equal to 0, otherwise k remains unchanged, i is n - 1, and ans is a[0].
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    dif = a[i + 1] - a[i]
    if dif == 0:
        res -= 1
    if dif != 0:
        if k >= dif * (i + 1):
            ans += dif
            k -= dif * (i + 1)
            res -= 1
        else:
            ans += k // (i + 1)
            if i != 0:
                res += k % (i + 1)
            k = 0
            break
        if k == 0:
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`ans_list` contains the value of `ans`, `_` is 2, `n` is a positive integer and must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers. If the difference between the first two elements of `a` is not 0, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. If the difference between the first two elements of `a` is 0, then `res` is `n - 2` and `dif` is 0. If `k` is 0, then `i` is 0, `ans` is `a[0]`, and `res` is `res - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`ans_list` contains the value of `ans` increased by `dif` if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, otherwise `ans` is increased by `k // (i + 1)`. `_` is 2, `n` is a positive integer and must be at least 3, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, `i` is increased by 2, `dif` is the difference between the (i+2)th and (i+1)th elements of `a`. If the difference between the (i+2)th and (i+1)th elements of `a` is 0, then `res` is decreased by 1. If `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, then `k` is decreased by `dif * (i + 1)` and `res` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0, `res` is increased by `k % (i + 1)`, and `k` is 0. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `dif` is 0, no changes are made to `ans_list`, `k`, `res`, or `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: _ is 2, n is a positive integer and must be at least i + 3, a is a sorted list of positive integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, i is i + 2, dif is the difference between the (i+1)th and ith elements of a. If dif is not 0, ans_list contains the value of ans increased by dif if k is greater than or equal to dif * (i + 1), otherwise ans is increased by k // (i + 1) if i is not equal to 0, otherwise ans is increased by k // (i + 3). k is decreased by dif * (i + 1) if k is greater than or equal to dif * (i + 1), otherwise k is 0. res is decreased by 1 if k is greater than or equal to dif * (i + 1), otherwise res is increased by k % (i + 1) if i is not equal to 0. If k is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If dif is 0, then res is decreased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
