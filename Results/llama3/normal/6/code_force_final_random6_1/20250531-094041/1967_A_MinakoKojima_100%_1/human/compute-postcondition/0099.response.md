Postcondition: ***`ans_list` contains the value of `ans`, `_` is 1, `n` is a positive integer and at least 3, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, `dif` is `a[3] - a[2]`, `i` is 2. If `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, then `ans` is increased by `dif`, `res` is decreased by 1, and `k` is decreased by `dif * (i + 1)`. If `dif` is 0, then `res` is `n - 3` or `n - 4`. Otherwise, `ans`, `res`, and `k` remain unchanged. If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
