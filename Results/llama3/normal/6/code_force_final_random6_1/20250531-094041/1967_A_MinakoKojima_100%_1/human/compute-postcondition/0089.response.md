Output State: **`ans_list` contains the value of `ans`, `_` is 1, `n` is a positive integer and at least 3, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, `dif` is `a[3] - a[2]`, `res` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `k` is 0, and `i` is 2**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `dif` has been updated to the difference between the third and second elements of the sorted list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
