To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n - 1` is at least 1, meaning `n` must be at least 2.

Before the loop starts, we have `i` as `n - 1`, which is the last index of the list `a`. For the loop to execute, `i` should be 0, as it will iterate from 0 to `n - 2`.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`ans_list` contains the value of ans, `_` is 1, `n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, `i` is 0, `dif` is `a[1] - a[0]`, `ans` is the smallest integer in `a`, `res` is `n - 1`, and `k` is an integer.**
