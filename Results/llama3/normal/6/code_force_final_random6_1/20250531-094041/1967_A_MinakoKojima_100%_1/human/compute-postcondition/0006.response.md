Output State: **`ans_list` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer that must be at least 2, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `ans` is the smallest integer in `a`, `res` is `n - 2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, `i` is 0, `dif` is `a[1] - a[0]` and the current value of `dif` is 0**

The code `res -= 1` decrements the value of `res` by 1. Since `res` was initially `n - 1`, its new value is `n - 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
