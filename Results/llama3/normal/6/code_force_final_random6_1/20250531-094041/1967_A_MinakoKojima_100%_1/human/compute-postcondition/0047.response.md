Postcondition: ***`ans_list` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer that must be at least 3, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, `i` is 2. If `k` is 0, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, then `ans` is increased by `dif`, `k` is decreased by `dif * (i + 1)`, and `res` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by `k // 3`, `res` is increased by `k % (2 + 1)`, and `k` is set to 0.***
