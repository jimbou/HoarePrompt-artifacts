Output State: **`ans_list` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer that must be at least 3, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, `i` is 2, `ans` is increased by `k // 3`**.

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding the result of the expression `k // (i + 1)`, where `i` is 2. The other variables remain unchanged, and the state of the input stream `stdin` is also unchanged.
