Output State: **`ans_list` contains the value of `ans`, `_` is 1, `n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, `i` is 0, `dif` is `a[1] - a[0]`, `ans` is the smallest integer in `a` plus `k // (i + 1)`, `res` is `n - 1`, and `k` is an integer. The current value of `dif` is not 0. Additionally, `k` is less than `dif * (i + 1)`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding `k // (i + 1)` to it. Since `i` is 0, `k // (i + 1)` is equal to `k // 1`, which is simply `k`. Therefore, `ans` is now the smallest integer in `a` plus `k`. The other variables remain unchanged.
