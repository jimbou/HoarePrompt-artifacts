Postcondition: ***`ans_list` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer that must be at least 3, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, `i` is 2, `ans` is increased by `k // 3`. If `i` is not equal to 0, `res` is increased by `k % (2 + 1)`.***
