Output State: **`ans_list` contains the value of `ans` increased by `a[i + 1] - a[i]` if `k` is greater than or equal to `(a[i + 1] - a[i]) * (i + 3)`, otherwise `ans` is increased by `k // (i + 3)`, `_` is 2, `n` is a positive integer and must be at least `i + 3`, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, `i` is `i + 2`, `dif` is the difference between the (i+1)th and ith elements of `a`, `ans` is increased by `k // (i + 1)`, `res` is increased by `k % (i + 1)`, `k` is decreased by `(a[i + 1] - a[i]) * (i + 3)` if `k` is greater than or equal to `(a[i + 1] - a[i]) * (i + 3)`, otherwise `k` is 0, and if `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated by adding `k % (i + 1)` to it. The other variables remain unchanged, with `ans_list` still containing the updated values of `ans`, `_` still being 2, `n` still being a positive integer and at least `i + 3`, `a` still being a sorted list of positive integers, `stdin` still containing multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, `i` still being `i + 2`, `dif` still being the difference between the (i+1)th and ith elements of `a`, `ans` still being increased by `k // (i + 1)`, and `k` still being decreased by `(a[i + 1] - a[i]) * (i + 3)` if `k` is greater than or equal to `(a[i + 1] - a[i]) * (i + 3)`, otherwise `k` is 0. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
