Postcondition: ***`ans_list` contains the value of `ans` increased by `dif` if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, otherwise `ans` is increased by `k // (i + 1)`. `_` is 2, `n` is a positive integer and must be at least 3, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, `i` is increased by 2, `dif` is the difference between the (i+2)th and (i+1)th elements of `a`. If the difference between the (i+2)th and (i+1)th elements of `a` is 0, then `res` is decreased by 1. If `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, then `k` is decreased by `dif * (i + 1)` and `res` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0, `res` is increased by `k % (i + 1)`, and `k` is 0. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `dif` is 0, no changes are made to `ans_list`, `k`, `res`, or `i`.***
