Output State: **ans_list contains the value of ans increased by dif, _ is 2, n is a positive integer and must be at least 3, a is a sorted list of positive integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, i is increased by 2, k is decreased by dif * (i + 1), res is decreased by 1, dif is the difference between the (i+2)th and (i+1)th elements of a. If the difference between the (i+2)th and (i+1)th elements of a is 0, then res is decreased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been increased by `dif`, which is the difference between the (i+2)th and (i+1)th elements of `a`. The value of `k` has been decreased by `dif * (i + 1)`, and the value of `res` has been decreased by 1. The values of `_`, `n`, `a`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The value of `i` has been increased by 2. The value of `dif` remains the same, which is the difference between the (i+2)th and (i+1)th elements of `a`. If the difference between the (i+2)th and (i+1)th elements of `a` is 0, then `res` is decreased by 1.
