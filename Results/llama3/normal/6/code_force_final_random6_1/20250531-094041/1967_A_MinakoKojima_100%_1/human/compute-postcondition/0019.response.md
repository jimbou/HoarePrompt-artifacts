Output State: **`ans_list` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer that must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `ans` is the smallest integer in `a` plus 0, `res` is `n - 1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, `i` is 0, `dif` is `a[1] - a[0]` and `dif` is not 0, the current value of `k` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged.
