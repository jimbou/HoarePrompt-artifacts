Postcondition: ***`ans_list` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer that must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `ans` is the smallest integer in `a` plus 0, `res` is `n - 1` if `i` is 0, otherwise `res` is `n - 1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, `i` is 0, `dif` is `a[1] - a[0]` and `dif` is not 0, the current value of `k` is 0***
