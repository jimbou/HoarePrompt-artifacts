The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be at least 3.
State: **`ans_list` contains the value of `ans`, `_` is 2, `n` is a positive integer and must be at least 3, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, `i` is increased by 1**
