Postcondition: ***`ans_list` contains the value of `ans`, `_` is 1, `n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, `dif` is `a[1] - a[0]`, `res` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `k` is an integer. If `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, then `ans` is `ans + dif`, `i` is 0, and `k` is `k - dif`. Otherwise, `ans` is the smallest integer in `a` plus `k // (i + 1)`, `i` is not 0, and `k` is 0. The current value of `k` is 0.***
