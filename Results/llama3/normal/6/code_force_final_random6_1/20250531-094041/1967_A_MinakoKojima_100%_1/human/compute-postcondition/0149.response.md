Postcondition: ***ans_list contains the value of ans increased by dif if k is greater than or equal to dif * (i + 1), otherwise ans is increased by k // (i + 1) if i is not equal to 0, otherwise ans is increased by k // (i + 3). k is decreased by dif * (i + 1) if k is greater than or equal to dif * (i + 1), otherwise k is 0. res is decreased by 1 if k is greater than or equal to dif * (i + 1), otherwise res is increased by k % (i + 1) if i is not equal to 0. _ is 2, n is a positive integer and must be at least i + 3, a is a sorted list of positive integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, i is i + 2, dif is the difference between the (i+1)th and ith elements of a.***
