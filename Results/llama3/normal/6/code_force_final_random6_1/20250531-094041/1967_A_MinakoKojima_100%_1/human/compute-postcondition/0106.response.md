The only variable in the loop head is variable `_`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_`. If `_` is less than the number of test cases, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, and the number of test cases is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be increased by 1, so `_` is 2, and the number of test cases must be at least 2.
State: **ans_list contains the value of ans, _ is 2, n is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of positive integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, dif is a[n - 1] - a[n - 2], res is n - 1 or n - 2 minus the number of times dif is not 0 plus k % n if k is not equal to 0, otherwise res is n - 1 or n - 2 minus the number of times dif is not 0, k is k - k // n - k % n if k is not equal to 0, otherwise k remains unchanged, i is n - 1, and ans is ans + k // n + (ans - 1) * (n - 1) + res if k is not equal to 0, otherwise ans is ans + (ans - 1) * (n - 1) + res**
