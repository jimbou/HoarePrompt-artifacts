The only variable in the loop head is the variable `_` and `input()`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `input()`. If `input()` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `ans_list` is an empty list and stdin contains multiple test cases. So for the loop to be executed `input()` must be greater than 0 and `_` is now 0.
State: **`ans_list` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases, `_` is 0, `input()` must be greater than 0**
