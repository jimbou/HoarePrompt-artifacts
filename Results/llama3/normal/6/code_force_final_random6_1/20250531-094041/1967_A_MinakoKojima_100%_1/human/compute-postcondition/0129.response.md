Output State: **`ans_list` contains the value of `ans`, `_` is 2, `n` is a positive integer and must be at least 3, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, `i` is increased by 2, `dif` is the difference between the (i+2)th and (i+1)th elements of `a`, `res` is decreased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been decreased by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `res` is now one less than its original value. The rest of the variables maintain their original values and properties, including `ans_list` containing the value of `ans`, `_` being 2, `n` being a positive integer at least 3, `a` being a sorted list of positive integers, `stdin` containing multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, `i` being increased by 2, and `dif` being the difference between the (i+2)th and (i+1)th elements of `a`.
