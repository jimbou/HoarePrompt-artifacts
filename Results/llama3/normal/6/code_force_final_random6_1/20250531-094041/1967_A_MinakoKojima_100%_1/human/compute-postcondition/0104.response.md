Postcondition: ***`ans_list` contains the value of `ans`, `_` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, `dif` is `a[n - 1] - a[n - 2]`, `res` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` minus the number of times `dif` is not 0 plus `k % n` if `k` is not equal to 0, otherwise `res` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` minus the number of times `dif` is not 0, `k` is `k - k // n - k % n` if `k` is not equal to 0, otherwise `k` remains unchanged, `i` is `n - 1`, and `ans` is `ans + k // n` if `k` is not equal to 0, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged.***
