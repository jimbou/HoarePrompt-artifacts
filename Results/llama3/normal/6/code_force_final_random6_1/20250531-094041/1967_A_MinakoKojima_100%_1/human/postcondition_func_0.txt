This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains n integers. The function sorts the integers, calculates a value 'ans' based on the sorted integers and the value of k, and appends this value to a list. After processing all test cases, the function prints the calculated values for each test case. The calculated value 'ans' represents the smallest integer in the sorted list plus the sum of differences between consecutive integers if k is sufficient, otherwise it's the smallest integer plus the sum of k divided by the current index.
