Postcondition: ***`ans_list` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer that must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, `i` is 1, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`. If `dif` is not 0, then if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif` times the current value of `i` plus `dif`, then `ans` is the smallest integer in `a` plus `dif` plus `dif`, and `res` is `n - 3`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `dif` times the current value of `i` but less than `dif` times the current value of `i` plus `dif`, then `ans` is the smallest integer in `a` plus `dif`, and `res` is `n - 2` if `i` is 1, otherwise `res` is `n - 2`. If `k` is less than `dif` times the current value of `i`, then `ans` is the smallest integer in `a` plus `dif` if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif` times the current value of `i`, otherwise `ans` is the smallest integer in `a` plus 0, plus `k // (i + 1)`, and `res` is `n - 2` plus `k` modulo `i + 1` if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif` times the current value of `i`, otherwise `res` is `n - 1` plus `k` modulo `i + 1` if `i` is 0, otherwise `res` is `n - 1` plus `k` modulo `i + 1`. If `k` is 0, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `dif` is 0, then `res` is `n - 3` if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif` times the current value of `i`, otherwise `res` is `n - 2` if `i` is 1, otherwise `res` is `n - 2`. If `dif` is not 0, then `k` is a positive integer if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif` times the current value of `i`, otherwise `k` is 0. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing.***
