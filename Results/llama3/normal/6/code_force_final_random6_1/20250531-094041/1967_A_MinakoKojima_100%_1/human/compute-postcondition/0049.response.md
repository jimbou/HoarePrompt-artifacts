Output State: **ans_list is an empty list, _ is 0, n is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of positive integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, i is n - 1, dif is a[1] - a[0] if i is 0, otherwise dif is a[i + 1] - a[i], ans is the smallest integer in a plus the sum of dif if k is greater than or equal to dif times the current value of i, otherwise ans is the smallest integer in a plus the sum of k // (i + 1), res is 0 if k is greater than or equal to dif times the current value of i, otherwise res is n - 1 plus the sum of k modulo i + 1 if i is not 0, otherwise res is n - 1, k is 0.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `ans_list` remains empty, the variable `_` remains 0, the variable `n` remains a positive integer, the list `a` remains a sorted list of positive integers, and the standard input `stdin` remains unchanged. The loop counter `i` is now `n - 1`, and the difference `dif` is the difference between the last two elements of the list `a`. The variable `ans` is the smallest integer in `a` plus the sum of the differences `dif` if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif` times the current value of `i`, otherwise `ans` is the smallest integer in `a` plus the sum of `k // (i + 1)`. The variable `res` is 0 if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif` times the current value of `i`, otherwise `res` is `n - 1` plus the sum of `k` modulo `i + 1` if `i` is not 0, otherwise `res` is `n - 1`. The variable `k` is now 0.
