Output State: **`ans_list` contains the value of `ans`, `_` is 2, `n` is a positive integer and must be at least 3, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, `i` is increased by 2, `dif` is the difference between the (i+2)th and (i+1)th elements of `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `dif` is calculated as the difference between the (i+2)th and (i+1)th elements of the sorted list `a`. The value of `i` is increased by 1 from the initial state, and the stdin now contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers. The other variables remain unchanged.
