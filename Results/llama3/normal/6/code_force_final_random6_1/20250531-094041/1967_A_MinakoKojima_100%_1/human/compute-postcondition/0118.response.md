Postcondition: ***`ans_list` contains the value of `a[0] + k`, `_` is 2, `n` is a positive integer and must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, `k` is `k - k // n - k % n` if `k` is not equal to 0, otherwise `k` remains unchanged, and the current value of `k` is less than `dif * (i + 1)`. The current value of `i` is not 0. The difference between the first two elements of `a` is not 0, and the current value of `dif` is not 0.***
