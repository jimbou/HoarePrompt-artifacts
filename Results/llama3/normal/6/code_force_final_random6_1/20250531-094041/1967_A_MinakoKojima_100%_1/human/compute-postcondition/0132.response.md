Output State: **`ans_list` contains the value of `ans`, `_` is 2, `n` is a positive integer and must be at least 3, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, `i` is increased by 2, `dif` is the difference between the (i+2)th and (i+1)th elements of `a`. If the difference between the (i+2)th and (i+1)th elements of `a` is 0, then `res` is decreased by 1, and `ans` is increased by `k // (i + 1)`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding `k // (i + 1)` to it. The other variables remain unchanged, with `_` still being 2, `n` being a positive integer at least 3, `a` being a sorted list of positive integers, and `stdin` containing multiple test cases minus 3 inputs. The value of `i` is still increased by 2, and `dif` is still the difference between the (i+2)th and (i+1)th elements of `a`. If the difference between the (i+2)th and (i+1)th elements of `a` is 0, then `res` is still decreased by 1.
