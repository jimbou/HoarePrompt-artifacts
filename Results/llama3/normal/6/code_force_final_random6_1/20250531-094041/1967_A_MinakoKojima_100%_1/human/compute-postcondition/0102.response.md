Postcondition: ***`ans_list` contains the value of `ans`, `_` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, `dif` is `a[n - 1] - a[n - 2]`, `res` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` minus the number of times `dif` is not 0, `k` is 0, and `i` is `n - 1`. If `dif` is not equal to 0 and `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, then `ans` is increased by `dif`, `res` is decreased by 1, and `k` is decreased by `dif * (i + 1)`. If `dif` is 0, then `res` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` minus the number of times `dif` is 0. Otherwise, `ans`, `res`, and `k` remain unchanged. The current value of `k` is not equal to 0.***
