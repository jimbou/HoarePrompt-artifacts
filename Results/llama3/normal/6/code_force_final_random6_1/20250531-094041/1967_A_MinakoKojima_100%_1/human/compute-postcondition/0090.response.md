Output State: **`ans_list` contains the value of `ans`, `_` is 1, `n` is a positive integer and at least 3, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, `dif` is `a[3] - a[2]`, `res` is `n - 2` or `n - 3`, `k` is 0, and `i` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to be either `n - 2` or `n - 3` because it was decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
