Output State: **ans_list is an empty list, _ is 0, n is a positive integer that must be at least 3, a is a sorted list of positive integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, i is 2, ans is increased by dif, k is decreased by dif * (i + 1), res is decreased by 1.**

In this output state, the values of `ans_list`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `stdin`, and `i` remain unchanged because they are not modified by the code. The value of `ans` is increased by `dif`, the value of `k` is decreased by `dif * (i + 1)`, and the value of `res` is decreased by 1.
