Output State: **`ans_list` contains the value of ans, `_` is 2, `n` is a positive integer and must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, `dif` is 0, `res` is `n - 2`, `k` is `k - k // n - k % n` if `k` is not equal to 0, otherwise `k` remains unchanged, `i` is 0, and `ans` is `a[0]`. The difference between the first two elements of `a` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to `n - 2`, which is one less than its initial value of `n - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `n`, `a`, `stdin`, `dif`, `k`, `i`, and `ans` are still valid.
