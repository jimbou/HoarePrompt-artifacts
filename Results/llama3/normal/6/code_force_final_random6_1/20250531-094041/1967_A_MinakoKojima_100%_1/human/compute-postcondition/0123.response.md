Postcondition: ***`ans_list` contains the value of `ans`, `_` is 2, `n` is a positive integer and must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers. The current value of `k` is 0. The difference between the first two elements of `a` is not 0. `i` is 0. The current value of `ans` is `a[0]`. `res` is `res - 1`***
