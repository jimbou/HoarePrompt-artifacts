Postcondition: ***`ans_list` contains the value of `ans`, `_` is 2, `n` is a positive integer and must be at least 3, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, `i` is increased by 2, `dif` is the difference between the (i+2)th and (i+1)th elements of `a`. If the difference between the (i+2)th and (i+1)th elements of `a` is 0, then `res` is decreased by 1, and `ans` is increased by `k // (i + 1)`. If `i` is not equal to 0, `res` is increased by `k % (i + 1)`.***
