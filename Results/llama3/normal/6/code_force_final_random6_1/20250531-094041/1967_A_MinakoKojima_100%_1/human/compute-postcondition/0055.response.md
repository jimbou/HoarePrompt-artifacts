Output State: **ans_list contains the value of ans, _ is 1, n is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of positive integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, i is n - 1, dif is a[1] - a[0] if i is 0, otherwise dif is a[i + 1] - a[i], ans is the smallest integer in a, res is n - 1, and k is an integer.**

The code snippet executes the following operations:

1. `n, k = map(int, input().split())`: This line reads two integers from the standard input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`, respectively. The value of `n` is a positive integer, and the value of `k` is an integer.

2. `a = list(map(int, input().split()))`: This line reads a list of integers from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `a`. The list `a` is a sorted list of positive integers.

3. `a.sort()`: This line sorts the list `a` in ascending order. Since `a` is already a sorted list of positive integers, this operation does not change the list.

4. `ans = a[0]`: This line assigns the smallest integer in the list `a` to the variable `ans`. Since `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `a[0]` is the smallest integer in the list.

5. `res = n - 1`: This line assigns the value of `n - 1` to the variable `res`. Since `n` is a positive integer, `res` is also a positive integer.

The final state of the variables after the code execution is as follows:

* `ans_list` contains the value of `ans`.
* `_` is 1.
* `n` is a positive integer.
* `a` is a sorted list of positive integers.
* `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers.
* `i` is `n - 1`.
* `dif` is `a[1] - a[0]` if `i` is 0, otherwise `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`.
* `ans` is the smallest integer in `a`.
* `res` is `n - 1`.
* `k` is an integer.
