Output State: **`ans_list` contains the value of ans, `_` is 1, `n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, `i` is 0, `dif` is `a[1] - a[0]`, `ans` is the smallest integer in `a`, `res` is `n - 1`, and `k` is an integer.**

The value of `dif` is updated to be the difference between the second element and the first element of the list `a`, which is `a[1] - a[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
