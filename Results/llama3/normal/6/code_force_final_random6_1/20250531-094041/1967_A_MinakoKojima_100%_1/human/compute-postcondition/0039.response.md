Postcondition: ***`ans_list` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer that must be at least 3, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, `i` is 2. If `dif` is 0, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
