To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is increased by 2, so `i` is now `i + 2`. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `i + 2`.

State: **`ans_list` contains the value of `ans` increased by `dif` if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 3)`, otherwise `ans` is increased by `k // (i + 3)`. `_` is 2, `n` is a positive integer and must be at least `i + 3`, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, `i` is `i + 2`, `dif` is the difference between the (i+4)th and (i+3)th elements of `a`. If the difference between the (i+4)th and (i+3)th elements of `a` is 0, then `res` is decreased by 1. If `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 3)`, then `k` is decreased by `dif * (i + 3)` and `res` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, if `i + 2` is not equal to 0, `res` is increased by `k % (i + 3)`, and `k` is 0. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `dif` is 0, no changes are made to `ans_list`, `k`, `res`, or `i`.**
