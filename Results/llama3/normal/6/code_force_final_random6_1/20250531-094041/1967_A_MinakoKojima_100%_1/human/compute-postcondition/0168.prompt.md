Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: ans_list contains the values of ans for all test cases, _ is the number of test cases minus 1, n is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of positive integers, stdin is empty, i is n - 1, dif is a[n - 1] - a[n - 2], ans is the smallest integer in a plus the sum of dif if k is greater than or equal to dif times the current value of i, otherwise ans is the smallest integer in a plus the sum of k // (i + 1), res is 0 if k is greater than or equal to dif times the current value of i, otherwise res is n - 1 plus the sum of k modulo i + 1 if i is not 0, otherwise res is n - 1, and k is either increased by k // n and res is increased by k % n, or k remains 0.
Code of the loop:
for a in ans_list:
    print(a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans_list` contains the values of `ans` for all test cases that must have at least 1 value, `a` is the first value in the list, _ is the number of test cases minus 1, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `stdin` is empty, `i` is `n` - 1, `dif` is `a[n - 1]` - `a[n - 2]`, `ans` is the smallest integer in `a` plus the sum of `dif` if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif` times the current value of `i`, otherwise `ans` is the smallest integer in `a` plus the sum of `k` // (`i` + 1), `res` is 0 if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif` times the current value of `i`, otherwise `res` is `n` - 1 plus the sum of `k` modulo `i` + 1 if `i` is not 0, otherwise `res` is `n` - 1, and `k` is either increased by `k` // `n` and `res` is increased by `k` % `n`, or `k` remains 0, and the sorted list of positive integers `a` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans_list` contains the values of `ans` for all test cases that must have at least 2 values, `a` is the second value in the list, _ is the number of test cases minus 1, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `stdin` is empty, `i` is `n` - 1, `dif` is `a[n - 1]` - `a[n - 2]`, `ans` is the smallest integer in `a` plus the sum of `dif` if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif` times the current value of `i`, otherwise `ans` is the smallest integer in `a` plus the sum of `k` // (`i` + 1), `res` is 0 if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif` times the current value of `i`, otherwise `res` is `n` - 1 plus the sum of `k` modulo `i` + 1 if `i` is not 0, otherwise `res` is `n` - 1, and `k` is either increased by `k` // `n` and `res` is increased by `k` % `n`, or `k` remains 0, and the sorted list of positive integers `a` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans_list` contains the values of `ans` for all test cases that must have at least 3 values, `a` is the third value in the list, _ is the number of test cases minus 1, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `stdin` is empty, `i` is `n` - 1, `dif` is `a[n - 1]` - `a[n - 2]`, `ans` is the smallest integer in `a` plus the sum of `dif` if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif` times the current value of `i`, otherwise `ans` is the smallest integer in `a` plus the sum of `k` // (`i` + 1), `res` is 0 if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif` times the current value of `i`, otherwise `res` is `n` - 1 plus the sum of `k` modulo `i` + 1 if `i` is not 0, otherwise `res` is `n` - 1, and `k` is either increased by `k` // `n` and `res` is increased by `k` % `n`, or `k` remains 0, and the sorted list of positive integers `a` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
