Output State: **`ans_list` contains the value of `ans`, `_` is 2, `n` is a positive integer and must be at least 3, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, `i` is increased by 2, `dif` is the difference between the (i+2)th and (i+1)th elements of `a`. If the difference between the (i+2)th and (i+1)th elements of `a` is 0, then `res` is decreased by 1, and `ans` is increased by `k // (i + 1)`. `res` is increased by `k % (i + 1)`**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that `res` has been increased by the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
