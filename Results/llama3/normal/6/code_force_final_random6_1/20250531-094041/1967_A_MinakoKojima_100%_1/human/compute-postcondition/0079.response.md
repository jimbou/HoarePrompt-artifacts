Output State: **ans_list contains the value of ans, _ is 1, n is a positive integer and at least 2, a is a sorted list of positive integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, dif is a[2] - a[1], res is n - 2, k is -dif * (i + 1), and i is 1. If dif is 0, then res is n - 2.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding `dif` to it. The value of `k` has been updated by subtracting `dif * (i + 1)` from it. The value of `res` has been decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
