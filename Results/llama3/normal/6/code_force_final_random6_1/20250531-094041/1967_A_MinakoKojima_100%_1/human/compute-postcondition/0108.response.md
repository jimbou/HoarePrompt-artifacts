To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n - 1` is at least 1, meaning `n` must be at least 2.

State: **`ans_list` contains the value of ans, `_` is 2, `n` is a positive integer and must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, `dif` is `a[n - 1]` - `a[n - 2]`, `res` is `n - 1`, `k` is `k - k // n - k % n` if `k` is not equal to 0, otherwise `k` remains unchanged, `i` is 0, and `ans` is `a[0]`.**
