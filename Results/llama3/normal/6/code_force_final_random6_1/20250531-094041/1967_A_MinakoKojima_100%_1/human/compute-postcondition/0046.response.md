Output State: **`ans_list` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer that must be at least 3, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, `i` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code executes a break statement, which means we exit the innermost loop or if statement we were directly inside. The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement. The rest of the conditions and values remain the same as in the initial state.
