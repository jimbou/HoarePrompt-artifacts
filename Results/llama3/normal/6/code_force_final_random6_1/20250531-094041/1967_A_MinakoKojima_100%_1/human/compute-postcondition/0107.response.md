Output State: **ans_list contains the value of ans, _ is 2, n is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of positive integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, dif is a[n - 1] - a[n - 2], res is n - 1, k is k - k // n - k % n if k is not equal to 0, otherwise k remains unchanged, i is n - 1, and ans is a[0].**

The code block modifies the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `ans`, and `res`. The first line assigns the integer values of the next two inputs to `n` and `k`, respectively, leaving stdin with multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers. The second line assigns a sorted list of positive integers to `a`, which is already sorted in the initial state, so `a` remains unchanged. The third line assigns the first element of `a` to `ans`, overwriting its previous value. The fourth line assigns `n - 1` to `res`, which is a new value. The values of `dif`, `i`, and `ans_list` remain unchanged.
