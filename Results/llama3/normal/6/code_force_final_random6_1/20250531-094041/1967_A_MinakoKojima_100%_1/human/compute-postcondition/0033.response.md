Output State: **`ans_list` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer that must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, `i` is 1, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `dif` times the current value of `i` plus `dif`, then `ans` is the smallest integer in `a` plus `dif` plus `dif`, and `res` is `n - 3`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `dif` times the current value of `i` but less than `dif` times the current value of `i` plus `dif`, then `ans` is the smallest integer in `a` plus `dif`, and `res` is `n - 2` if `i` is 1, otherwise `res` is `n - 2`. If `k` is less than `dif` times the current value of `i`, then `ans` is the smallest integer in `a` plus `dif` if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif` times the current value of `i`, otherwise `ans` is the smallest integer in `a` plus 0, plus `k // (i + 1)`, and `res` is `n - 2` plus `k` modulo `i + 1` if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif` times the current value of `i`, otherwise `res` is `n - 1` plus `k` modulo `i + 1` if `i` is 0, otherwise `res` is `n - 1` plus `k` modulo `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables do not change, but we exit the loop or if statement we were directly inside.
