Output State: **`ans_list` contains the value of ans, `_` is 2, `n` is a positive integer and must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, `dif` is `a[1] - a[0]`, `res` is `n - 1`, `k` is `k - k // n - k % n` if `k` is not equal to 0, otherwise `k` remains unchanged, `i` is 0, and `ans` is `a[0]`.**

In this output state, the value of `dif` has been updated to `a[1] - a[0]`, which is the difference between the first two elements of the sorted list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
