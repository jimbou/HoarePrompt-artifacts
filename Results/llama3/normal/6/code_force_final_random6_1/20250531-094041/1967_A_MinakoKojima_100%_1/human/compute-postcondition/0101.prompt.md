Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: ans_list contains the value of ans, _ is 1, n is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of positive integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, i is n - 1, dif is a[1] - a[0] if i is 0, otherwise dif is a[i + 1] - a[i], ans is the smallest integer in a, res is n - 1, and k is an integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    dif = a[i + 1] - a[i]
    if dif == 0:
        res -= 1
    if dif != 0:
        if k >= dif * (i + 1):
            ans += dif
            k -= dif * (i + 1)
            res -= 1
        else:
            ans += k // (i + 1)
            if i != 0:
                res += k % (i + 1)
            k = 0
            break
        if k == 0:
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`ans_list` contains the value of `ans`, `_` is 1, `n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, `dif` is `a[1] - a[0]`, `res` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `k` is 0, and `i` is 0. If `dif` is not 0, the loop or if statement breaks. Otherwise, the loop or if statement continues.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`ans_list` contains the value of `ans`, `_` is 1, `n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`, `res` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `k` is 0, and `i` is 1. If `dif` is not equal to 0, then if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, `k` is updated to `-dif * (i + 1)`. Otherwise, `res` is updated to `n - 1` or `n - 2` plus `k % (i + 1)`, and `ans` is increased by 0. If `dif` is 0, then `res` is `n - 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`ans_list` contains the value of `ans`, `_` is 1, `n` is a positive integer and at least 3, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, `dif` is `a[3] - a[2]`, `res` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `k` is 0, and `i` is 2. If `dif` is not equal to 0 and `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, then `ans` is increased by `dif`, `res` is decreased by 1, and `k` is decreased by `dif * (i + 1)`. If `dif` is 0, then `res` is `n - 3` or `n - 4`. Otherwise, `ans`, `res`, and `k` remain unchanged. If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
