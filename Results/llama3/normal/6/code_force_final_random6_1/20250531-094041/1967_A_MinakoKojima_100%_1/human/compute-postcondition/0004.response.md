Output State: **`ans_list` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer that must be at least 2, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `ans` is the smallest integer in `a`, `res` is `n - 1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, `i` is 0, `dif` is `a[1] - a[0]`**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `ans_list` is still empty, the variable `_` remains 0, `n` is still a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `k` is still a positive integer, `a` is still a sorted list of positive integers, `ans` is still the smallest integer in `a`, `res` is still `n - 1`, `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, `i` is still 0, and a new variable `dif` is introduced, which is the difference between the second and first elements of the sorted list `a`.
