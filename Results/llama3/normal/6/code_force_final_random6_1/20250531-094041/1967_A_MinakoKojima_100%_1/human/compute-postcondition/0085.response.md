Output State: **`ans_list` contains the value of `ans`, `_` is 1, `n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`, `res` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `k` is 0, and `i` is 1. If `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, then `k` is updated to `-dif * (i + 1)`. Otherwise, `res` is updated to `n - 1` or `n - 2` plus `k % (i + 1)`, and `ans` is increased by 0. If `dif` is 0, then `res` is `n - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables remain the same, but the program execution is interrupted, and we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
