Output State: **ans_list contains the value of ans, _ is 1, n is a positive integer and at least 2, a is a sorted list of positive integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, i is 0, dif is a[1] - a[0], ans is ans + dif, res is n - 2, and k is k - dif.**

The code block increments the value of `ans` by `dif`, which is the difference between the first two elements of the sorted list `a`. The value of `k` is decreased by the product of `dif` and `i + 1`, where `i` is 0. The value of `res` is decremented by 1. The remaining variables and the state of the input remain unchanged.
