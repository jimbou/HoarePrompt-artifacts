Output State: **`ans_list` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer that must be at least 3, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, `i` is 2, `dif` is `a[3] - a[2]`.**

In this output state, the value of `dif` has been updated to `a[3] - a[2]`, which is the difference between the third and second elements of the sorted list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
