Output State: **ans_list contains the value of ans, _ is 1, n is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of positive integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, dif is a[n - 1] - a[n - 2], res is n - 1 or n - 2 minus the number of times dif is not 0 plus k % n, k is k - k // n - k % n, i is n - 1, ans is ans + k // n.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been increased by the integer division of `k` by `n`, and the value of `res` has been increased by the remainder of `k` divided by `n`. The value of `k` has been decreased by the sum of the integer division of `k` by `n` and the remainder of `k` divided by `n`, effectively setting it to 0. The values of `n`, `a`, `dif`, `i`, and `_` remain unchanged. The state of `stdin` also remains unchanged.
