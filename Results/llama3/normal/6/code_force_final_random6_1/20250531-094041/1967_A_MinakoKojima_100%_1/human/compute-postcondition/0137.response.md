Output State: **`ans_list` contains the value of `ans` increased by `dif` if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, otherwise `ans` is increased by `k // (i + 1)`. `_` is 2, `n` is a positive integer and must be at least 3, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, `i` is increased by 2, `dif` is the difference between the (i+2)th and (i+1)th elements of `a`. If the difference between the (i+2)th and (i+1)th elements of `a` is 0, then `res` is decreased by 1. If `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, then `k` is decreased by `dif * (i + 1)` and `res` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0, `res` is increased by `k % (i + 1)`, and `k` is 0. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables do not change, but the program execution is interrupted, and we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
