Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: ans_list is an empty list, _ is 0, n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of positive integers, ans is the smallest integer in a, res is n - 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    dif = a[i + 1] - a[i]
    if dif == 0:
        res -= 1
    if dif != 0:
        if k >= dif * (i + 1):
            ans += dif
            k -= dif * (i + 1)
            res -= 1
        else:
            ans += k // (i + 1)
            if i != 0:
                res += k % (i + 1)
            k = 0
            break
        if k == 0:
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`ans_list` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer that must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `ans` is the smallest integer in `a` plus `dif` if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif` times the current value of `i`, otherwise `ans` is the smallest integer in `a` plus 0, `res` is `n - 2` if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif` times the current value of `i`, otherwise `res` is `n - 1` if `i` is 0, otherwise `res` is `n - 1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, `i` is 0, `dif` is `a[1] - a[0]`. If `dif` is not 0, then `k` is a positive integer if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif` times the current value of `i`, otherwise `k` is 0. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`ans_list` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer that must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, `i` is 1, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`. If `dif` is not 0, then if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif` times the current value of `i` plus `dif`, then `ans` is the smallest integer in `a` plus `dif` plus `dif`, and `res` is `n - 3`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `dif` times the current value of `i` but less than `dif` times the current value of `i` plus `dif`, then `ans` is the smallest integer in `a` plus `dif`, and `res` is `n - 2` if `i` is 1, otherwise `res` is `n - 2`. If `k` is less than `dif` times the current value of `i`, then `ans` is the smallest integer in `a` plus `dif` if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif` times the current value of `i`, otherwise `ans` is the smallest integer in `a` plus 0, plus `k // (i + 1)`, and `res` is `n - 2` plus `k` modulo `i + 1` if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif` times the current value of `i`, otherwise `res` is `n - 1` plus `k` modulo `i + 1` if `i` is 0, otherwise `res` is `n - 1` plus `k` modulo `i + 1`. If `k` is 0, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `dif` is 0, then `res` is `n - 3` if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif` times the current value of `i`, otherwise `res` is `n - 2` if `i` is 1, otherwise `res` is `n - 2`. If `dif` is not 0, then `k` is a positive integer if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif` times the current value of `i`, otherwise `k` is 0. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`ans_list` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer that must be at least 3, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, `i` is 2. If `dif` is 0, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `k` is 0, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, then `ans` is increased by `dif`, `k` is decreased by `dif * (i + 1)`, and `res` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by `k // 3`, `res` is increased by `k % (2 + 1)`, and `k` is set to 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
