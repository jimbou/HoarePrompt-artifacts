Postcondition: ***ans_list is an empty list, _ is 0, n is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of positive integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, i is n - 1, dif is a[1] - a[0] if i is 0, otherwise dif is a[i + 1] - a[i], ans is the smallest integer in a plus the sum of dif if k is greater than or equal to dif times the current value of i, otherwise ans is the smallest integer in a plus the sum of k // (i + 1), res is 0 if k is greater than or equal to dif times the current value of i, otherwise res is n - 1 plus the sum of k modulo i + 1 if i is not 0, otherwise res is n - 1, and k is either increased by k // n and res is increased by k % n, or k remains 0.***
