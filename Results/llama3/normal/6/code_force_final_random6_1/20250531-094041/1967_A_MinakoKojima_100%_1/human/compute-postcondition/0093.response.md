Output State: **`ans_list` contains the value of `ans`, `_` is 1, `n` is a positive integer and at least 3, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, `dif` is `a[3] - a[2]`, `res` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `k` is 0, `i` is 2, and `ans` is increased by 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is increased by 0 because `k` is 0, and the other variables remain unchanged. The list `ans_list` still contains the value of `ans`. The values of `_`, `n`, `a`, `stdin`, `dif`, `res`, `k`, and `i` are the same as before.
