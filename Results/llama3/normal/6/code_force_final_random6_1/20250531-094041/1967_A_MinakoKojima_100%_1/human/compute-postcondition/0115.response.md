Output State: **ans_list contains the value of ans, _ is 2, n is a positive integer and must be at least 2, a is a sorted list of positive integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, k is k - k // n - k % n if k is not equal to 0, otherwise k remains unchanged, i is 0, ans is a[0] + dif, k is k - dif * (i + 1), res is res - 1, and the difference between the first two elements of a is not 0, and the current value of k is greater than or equal to the product of dif and i + 1.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by `dif`, and `k` has been decremented by the product of `dif` and `i + 1`. The value of `res` has been decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
