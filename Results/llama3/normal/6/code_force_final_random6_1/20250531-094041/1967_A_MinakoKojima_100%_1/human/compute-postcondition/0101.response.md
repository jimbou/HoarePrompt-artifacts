Output State: **`ans_list` contains the value of `ans`, `_` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, `dif` is `a[n - 1] - a[n - 2]`, `res` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` minus the number of times `dif` is not 0, `k` is 0, and `i` is `n - 1`. If `dif` is not equal to 0 and `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, then `ans` is increased by `dif`, `res` is decreased by 1, and `k` is decreased by `dif * (i + 1)`. If `dif` is 0, then `res` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` minus the number of times `dif` is 0. Otherwise, `ans`, `res`, and `k` remain unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop iterates `n - 1` times, where `n` is a positive integer. After each iteration, the value of `ans` is updated based on the difference between consecutive elements in the sorted list `a`. If the difference is not zero, `ans` is increased by the difference, and `res` is decreased by 1. If the difference is zero, `res` is decreased by 1. The value of `k` is updated based on the difference and the current value of `i`. If `k` is greater than or equal to the difference multiplied by `i + 1`, `k` is decreased by the difference multiplied by `i + 1`. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged. After the loop finishes executing, `ans_list` contains the final value of `ans`, `dif` is the difference between the last two elements of `a`, `res` is the final value of `res`, `k` is 0, and `i` is `n - 1`.
