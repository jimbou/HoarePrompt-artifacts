Output State: **`ans_list` contains the values of `ans` for all test cases, `a` is the last value in the list, _ is the number of test cases minus 1, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `stdin` is empty, `i` is `n` - 1, `dif` is `a[n - 1]` - `a[n - 2]`, `ans` is the smallest integer in `a` plus the sum of `dif` if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif` times the current value of `i`, otherwise `ans` is the smallest integer in `a` plus the sum of `k` // (`i` + 1), `res` is 0 if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif` times the current value of `i`, otherwise `res` is `n` - 1 plus the sum of `k` modulo `i` + 1 if `i` is not 0, otherwise `res` is `n` - 1, and `k` is either increased by `k` // `n` and `res` is increased by `k` % `n`, or `k` remains 0, and the sorted list of positive integers `a` is being printed**

The loop has executed all its iterations, and the output state reflects the final values of the variables. The loop has printed all the sorted lists of positive integers in `ans_list`, and the variables `a`, `_`, `n`, `i`, `dif`, `ans`, `res`, and `k` have reached their final values. The loop has completed its execution, and the program has terminated.
