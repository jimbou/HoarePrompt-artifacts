Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. The program reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each case consists of three integers: n, a, and b. For each case, it calculates and prints a value based on the following conditions:

1. If the price of two yogurts at the regular price (2 * a) is less than the price of two yogurts at the promotion price (b), it prints the product of n and a. This is because buying yogurts at the regular price is cheaper in this case.

2. If n is even, it prints the integer part of the product of n and b divided by 2. This is because buying yogurts in pairs at the promotion price is cheaper when n is even.

3. If n is odd, it prints the value of (n-1)/2 and then the product of this value and b plus a. However, this part of the code seems incorrect. The correct calculation for the odd case should be the product of (n-1)/2 and b plus a, not printing (n-1)/2 separately.

Despite the mistake in the odd case, the program still produces the correct output for the given example inputs. However, this is likely due to the specific values in the example inputs rather than the correctness of the program.

Correctness: **False**
