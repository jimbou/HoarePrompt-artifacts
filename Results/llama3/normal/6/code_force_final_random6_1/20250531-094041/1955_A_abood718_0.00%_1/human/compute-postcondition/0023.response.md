Output State: **`i` is 1, `A`, `B`, `C` are integers that are assigned the first three integers from the input, `X` is the integer part of half of `A`, stdin contains the rest of the input**

In this output state, the value of `X` is calculated by performing integer division of `A` by 2, which means it will be the largest integer less than or equal to half of `A`. The values of `i`, `A`, `B`, and `C` remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains the rest of the input.
