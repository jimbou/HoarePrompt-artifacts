The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each case consists of three integers: n, a, and b. For each case, it calculates and prints a value based on the following conditions: if b is less than half of c, it prints the product of n and b; if n is even, it prints the integer part of the product of n and c divided by 2; if n is odd, it prints the value of (n-1)/2 and then the product of this value and c plus b. The function processes all test cases and then terminates, leaving the input stream empty.
