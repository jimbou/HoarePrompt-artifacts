According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the input from `stdin`. If the input from `stdin` is an integer `t` that is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by `t` lines, each containing three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30), so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 0 and `stdin` contains an integer `t` that is at least 1.
State: **`stdin` contains an integer `t` that is at least 1, `i` is 0**
