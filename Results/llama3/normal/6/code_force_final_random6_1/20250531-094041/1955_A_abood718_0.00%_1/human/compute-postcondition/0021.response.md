The code prints the result of the expression `A * C / 2`, where `A` and `C` are integers assigned from the input. The expression calculates the product of `A` and `C`, then divides the result by 2, and finally converts the result to an integer using the `int()` function.

Since the exact values of `A` and `C` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated result.

Output: **the integer result of (A * C / 2) (where A and C are the first and third integers from the input)**
