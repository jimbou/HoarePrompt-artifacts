Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `A`, `B`, `C` are integers that are assigned the first three integers from the input, stdin contains the rest of the input. If `B` is less than half of `C`, the product of `A` and `B` is printed. If `B` is not less than half of `C`, then if `A` is even, the integer part of the product of `A` and `C` divided by 2 is printed. If `A` is odd, the integer part of half of `A` is printed, and the product of the integer part of half of `A` and `C` plus `B` is printed.**
