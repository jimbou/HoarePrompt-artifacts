The code prints the integer value of the expression `A * C / 2`. Here, `A` and `C` are integers that are assigned the next three integers from the input, and `i` is 2.

Since `A` and `C` are assigned the next three integers from the input, their exact values are not known. However, we can describe their values as the first and third integers from the input, respectively.

Therefore, the output will be the integer value of the expression `A * C / 2`, where `A` is the first integer from the input and `C` is the third integer from the input.

Output: **the integer value of (the first integer from the input * the third integer from the input) / 2**
