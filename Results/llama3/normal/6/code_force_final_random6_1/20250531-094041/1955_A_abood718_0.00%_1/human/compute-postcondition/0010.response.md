Output State: **`i` is 0, `A` is an odd integer, `B` and `C` are integers, `B * 2` is not less than `C`, `X` is an integer equal to (`A` - 1) / 2, stdin contains an integer `t` that is at least 1.**

In this output state, the value of `X` is calculated as the integer division of `A` by 2, which is equivalent to (`A` - 1) / 2 since `A` is an odd integer. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
