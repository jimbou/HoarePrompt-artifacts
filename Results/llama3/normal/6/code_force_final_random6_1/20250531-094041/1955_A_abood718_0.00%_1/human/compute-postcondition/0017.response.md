The only variables in the loop head are variable `i` and `stdin`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `stdin`. If `i` is less than the integer `t` read from `stdin`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains an integer `t` that is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and `stdin` must contain an integer `t` that is at least 2.
State: **`i` is 1, `A`, `B`, `C` are integers, stdin contains an integer `t` that is at least 2.**
