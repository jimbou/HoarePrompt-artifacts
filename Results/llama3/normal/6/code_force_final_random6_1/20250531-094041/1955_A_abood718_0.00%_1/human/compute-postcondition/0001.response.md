Output State: **`i` is 0, `A`, `B`, `C` are integers, stdin contains an integer `t` that is at least 1.**

In this output state, the values of `A`, `B`, `C` are integers because `map(int, input().split())` converts the input to integers. The value of `i` remains 0 because it is not affected by the code. The stdin still contains an integer `t` that is at least 1 because the code only reads the first line of input, which is split into `A`, `B`, `C`.
