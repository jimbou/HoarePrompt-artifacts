Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `A`, `B`, `C` are integers that are assigned the next three integers from the input, stdin contains the rest of the input. If `A` is even, the integer value of half the product of `A` and `C` is being printed. If `A` is odd, the integer division of `A` by 2, which is `X`, is being printed, and the value of the expression `X * C + B` is being printed, where `X` is the integer division of `A` by 2, `C` is the third integer from the input, and `B` is the second integer from the input.**
