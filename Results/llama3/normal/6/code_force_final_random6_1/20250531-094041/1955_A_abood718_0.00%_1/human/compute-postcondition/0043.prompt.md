Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
    if B * 2 < C:
        print(A * B)
    elif A % 2 == 0:
        print(int(A * C / 2))
    else:
        X = A // 2
        print(X)
        print(X * C + B)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 0, `A`, `B`, `C` are integers, stdin contains an integer `t` that is at least 1. If `B * 2` is less than `C`, the product of `A` and `B` is printed. If `B * 2` is not less than `C`, then if `A` is even, the integer part of the product of `A` and `C` divided by 2 is printed. If `A` is odd, the value of `X` which is equal to (`A` - 1) / 2 is printed, and the value of `X * C + B` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `A`, `B`, `C` are integers that are assigned the first three integers from the input, stdin contains the rest of the input. If `B` is less than half of `C`, the product of `A` and `B` is printed. If `B` is not less than half of `C`, then if `A` is even, the integer part of the product of `A` and `C` divided by 2 is printed. If `A` is odd, the integer part of half of `A` is printed, and the product of the integer part of half of `A` and `C` plus `B` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `A`, `B`, `C` are integers that are assigned the next three integers from the input, stdin contains the rest of the input. If `B` * 2 is less than `C`, the product of `A` and `B` is being printed. Otherwise, if `A` is even, the integer value of half the product of `A` and `C` is being printed. If `A` is odd, the integer division of `A` by 2, which is `X`, is being printed, and the value of the expression `X * C + B` is being printed, where `X` is the integer division of `A` by 2, `C` is the third integer from the input, and `B` is the second integer from the input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
