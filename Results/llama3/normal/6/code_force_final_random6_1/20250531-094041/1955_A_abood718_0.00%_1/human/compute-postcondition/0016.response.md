Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `A`, `B`, `C` are integers, stdin contains an integer `t` that is at least 1. If `B * 2` is less than `C`, the product of `A` and `B` is printed. If `B * 2` is not less than `C`, then if `A` is even, the integer part of the product of `A` and `C` divided by 2 is printed. If `A` is odd, the value of `X` which is equal to (`A` - 1) / 2 is printed, and the value of `X * C + B` is printed.***
