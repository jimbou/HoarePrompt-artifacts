The code prints the integer value of the expression `A * C / 2`. Since `A` is even, `A * C` is even, and `A * C / 2` is an integer. The value of `A * C / 2` is the product of `A` and `C` divided by 2.
Output: **The integer value of (A * C / 2) (where A is the current even value of A and C is the value of C)**
