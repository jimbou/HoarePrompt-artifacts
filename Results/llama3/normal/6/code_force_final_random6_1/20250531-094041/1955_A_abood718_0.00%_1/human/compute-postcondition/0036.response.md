Output State: **`i` is 2, `A`, `B`, `C` are integers that are assigned the next three integers from the input, `X` is the integer division of `A` by 2, stdin contains the rest of the input**

In this output state, the value of `X` is calculated by performing integer division of `A` by 2. The values of `i`, `A`, `B`, `C` remain unchanged, and stdin still contains the rest of the input.
