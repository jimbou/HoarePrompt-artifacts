The code prints the result of the expression `X * C + B`, where `X` is the integer division of `A` by 2, `C` is the third integer from the input, and `B` is the second integer from the input.

Since `X` is the integer division of `A` by 2, its value is `A // 2`. `C` is the third integer from the input, and `B` is the second integer from the input.

Therefore, the expression `X * C + B` can be rewritten as `(A // 2) * C + B`.

Output: **(A // 2) * C + B (where A is the first integer from the input, C is the third integer from the input, and B is the second integer from the input)**
