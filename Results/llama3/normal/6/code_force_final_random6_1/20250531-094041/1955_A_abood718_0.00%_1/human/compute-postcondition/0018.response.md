Output State: **`i` is 1, `A`, `B`, `C` are integers that are assigned the first three integers from the input, stdin contains the rest of the input**.

In this output state, the value of `i` remains unchanged, which is 1. The values of `A`, `B`, and `C` are updated to the first three integers from the input, which is a space-separated list of integers. The stdin now contains the rest of the input, which is at least one integer since `t` is at least 2.
