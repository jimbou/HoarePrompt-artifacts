The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the input. If `i` is less than the integer read from the input, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and the input must contain at least one more integer.
State: **`i` is 2, `A`, `B`, `C` are integers that are assigned the next three integers from the input, stdin contains the rest of the input**
