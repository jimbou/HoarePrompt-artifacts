Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. The program reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each case consists of three integers: n, a, and b.

The program's logic is as follows:

1. If the price of two yogurts at the regular price (2a) is less than the price of two yogurts at the promotion price (b), it prints the product of n and a. This is because buying n yogurts at the regular price is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price.

2. If the number of yogurts (n) is even, it prints the integer part of the product of n and b divided by 2. This is because buying n yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper, and since n is even, we can buy all yogurts at the promotion price.

3. If the number of yogurts (n) is odd, it calculates the value of (n-1)/2 and prints this value, then prints the product of this value and b plus a. This is because we can buy (n-1) yogurts at the promotion price, and the remaining yogurt at the regular price.

However, there is a mistake in the last condition. The program prints the value of (n-1)/2, which is not necessary. It should only print the product of (n-1)/2 and b plus a.

Correctness: **False**
