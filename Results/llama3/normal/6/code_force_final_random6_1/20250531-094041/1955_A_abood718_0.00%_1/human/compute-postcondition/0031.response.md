Output State: **`i` is 2, `A`, `B`, `C` are integers that are assigned the next three integers from the input, stdin contains the rest of the input**

In this output state, the value of `i` remains unchanged at 2. The variables `A`, `B`, and `C` are assigned the next three integers from the input, which means they now hold specific integer values. The stdin still contains the rest of the input, but the first three integers have been consumed and assigned to `A`, `B`, and `C`.
