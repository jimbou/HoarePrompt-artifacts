Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost of buying n yogurts. In the case where A is odd and B * 2 < C, the program prints X, which is the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price, but it does not calculate the correct total cost. The correct total cost should be X * C + B, where X is the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price, and B is the price of the remaining yogurt.

For example, if A = 3, B = 5, and C = 9, the program prints 1, which is incorrect. The correct total cost should be 1 * 9 + 5 = 14.

The correct program should be:

def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
