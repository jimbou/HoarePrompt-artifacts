Output State: **`i` is `t-1`, `A`, `B`, `C` are integers that are assigned the last three integers from the input, stdin contains an empty string. If `B * 2` is less than `C`, the product of `A` and `B` is printed. If `B * 2` is not less than `C`, then if `A` is even, the integer part of the product of `A` and `C` divided by 2 is printed. If `A` is odd, the value of `X` which is equal to (`A` - 1) / 2 is printed, and the value of `X * C + B` is printed.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed `t-1` times, where `t` is the initial integer input. The variables `A`, `B`, and `C` have been assigned the last three integers from the input, and the stdin contains an empty string, indicating that all input has been consumed. The output state also describes the conditions under which different values are printed, depending on the values of `A`, `B`, and `C`.
