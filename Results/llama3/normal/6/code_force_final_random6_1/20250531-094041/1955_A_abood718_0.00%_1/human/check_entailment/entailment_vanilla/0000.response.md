Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. The program takes three integers as input: n (the number of yogurts), a (the price for one yogurt), and b (the price for two yogurts on promotion).

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program iterates over the number of test cases (t) using a for loop.

2. For each test case, it reads three integers (n, a, b) from the input.

3. It then checks if the price of two yogurts at the regular price (2a) is less than the price of two yogurts at the promotion price (b). If this condition is true, it means that buying yogurts at the regular price is cheaper, so it prints the total cost as n * a.

4. If the condition in step 3 is false, it checks if the number of yogurts (n) is even. If n is even, it means that Maxim can buy all yogurts in pairs, so it prints the total cost as (n * b) / 2.

5. If n is odd, it calculates the number of pairs of yogurts Maxim can buy (X = n // 2) and prints the total cost as X * b + a. However, there is a mistake in this line. The correct calculation should be X * b + a, but the program prints X first and then X * b + a on the next line, which is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
