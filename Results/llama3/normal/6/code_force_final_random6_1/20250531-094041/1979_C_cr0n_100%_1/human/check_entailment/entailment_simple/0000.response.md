Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem where you need to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. The program takes the number of outcomes and the multipliers for each outcome as input, calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers, and then distributes the coins among the outcomes based on the LCM.

The program first calculates the LCM of the multipliers using the `func_1` function, which returns the LCM of two positive integers. The LCM is calculated by multiplying the two numbers and then dividing by their greatest common divisor (gcd).

The program then calculates the product of the LCM and each multiplier, and stores these products in the `vprod` list. The sum of these products is subtracted from the LCM to get the remaining amount of coins.

If the remaining amount of coins is less than or equal to 0, the program prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required. Otherwise, the program prints the products in the `vprod` list, which represent the bets on each outcome.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
