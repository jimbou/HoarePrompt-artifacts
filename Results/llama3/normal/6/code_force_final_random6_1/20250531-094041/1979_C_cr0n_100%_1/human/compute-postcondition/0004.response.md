Output State: **`vals` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `N` is a positive integer equal to the number of elements in `vals`, `den` is the result of `func_1` applied to the result of `func_1` applied to the second element of `vals` and the second element of `vals`, and the second element of `vals`, `x` is the second element of `vals`, `stdin` contains no input**

In this output state, the value of `den` has been updated to be the result of applying `func_1` to its previous value (which was the result of `func_1` applied to the second element of `vals` and the second element of `vals`) and the second element of `vals`. The values of `vals`, `N`, `x`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
