Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of distributing coins among different outcomes in a game such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program uses two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers `a` and `b` using the formula `a * b // gcd(a, b)`, where `gcd` is the greatest common divisor.

`func_2` is the main function that solves the problem. It first reads the number of outcomes `N` and the multipliers `vals` for each outcome. It then calculates the least common multiple `den` of all the multipliers using `func_1`.

Next, it calculates the product of `den` and each multiplier `r` in `vals`, and stores the results in `vprod`. The idea is to distribute the coins such that the total amount bet on all outcomes is `den`, and the amount bet on each outcome `i` is `vprod[i]`.

However, this distribution may not always be possible, because the total amount bet on all outcomes may exceed `den`. To check this, the program calculates the difference `den - sum(vprod)`. If this difference is less than or equal to 0, it means that the total amount bet on all outcomes exceeds `den`, and the program prints -1.

Otherwise, the program prints the distribution of coins, which is the values in `vprod`.

Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to distribute the coins among the outcomes. The use of the least common multiple `den` ensures that the total amount bet on all outcomes is minimized, and the calculation of `vprod` ensures that the amount bet on each outcome is maximized.

The program also correctly handles the case where the total amount bet on all outcomes exceeds `den`, by printing -1 in this case.

Overall, the program is a correct and efficient solution to the problem.
