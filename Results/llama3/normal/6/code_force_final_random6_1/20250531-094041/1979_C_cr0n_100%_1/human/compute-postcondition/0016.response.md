Functionality: **This function calculates the result of repeatedly applying the func_1 function to the elements of a list of integers, then uses this result to calculate a new list of integers where each element is the integer division of the result by the corresponding element in the original list. If the result minus the sum of the new list is less than or equal to 0, it prints -1 and returns without modifying the original list. Otherwise, it prints the new list of integers.**
