The code prints a string of space-separated integers, where each integer is the result of the integer division of the original value of `den` by the corresponding element in the list `vals`. 

Since `den` is the result of repeatedly applying `func_1` to the elements of `vals`, and `vprod` is a list of integers where each element is the integer division of the original value of `den` by the corresponding element in `vals`, the printed string will contain the integer divisions of `den` by each element in `vals`.

Output: **[den//vals[0]] [den//vals[1]] [den//vals[2]] ... [den//vals[N-1]] (where den is the result of repeatedly applying func_1 to the elements of vals, and vals is a list of integers)**
