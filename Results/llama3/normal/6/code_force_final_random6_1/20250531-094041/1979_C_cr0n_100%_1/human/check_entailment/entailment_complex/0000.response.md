Reasoning: 

The problem requires determining how to distribute coins in a game with n possible outcomes, each with a multiplier k_i, such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Function 1 calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two positive integers a and b, which is used in Function 2 to calculate the LCM of all elements in the list vals.

Function 2 first calculates the LCM of all elements in vals and stores it in den. It then calculates a new list vprod where each element is the integer division of den by the corresponding element in vals. If den minus the sum of vprod is less than or equal to 0, it prints -1 and returns. Otherwise, it prints the list vprod.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the required logic. The LCM of all elements in vals is calculated correctly using Function 1, and the new list vprod is calculated correctly using the LCM. The program also correctly checks if den minus the sum of vprod is less than or equal to 0 and prints -1 if it is. Otherwise, it prints the list vprod, which represents the bets on each outcome.

Correctness: **True**
