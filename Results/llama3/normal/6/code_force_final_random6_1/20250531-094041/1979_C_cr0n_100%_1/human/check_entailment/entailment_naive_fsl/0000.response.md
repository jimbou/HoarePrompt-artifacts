Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program is designed to determine how to distribute coins in a game with n possible outcomes, each with a multiplier k_i. The goal is to bet a certain amount of coins on each outcome such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program uses two functions: func_1 calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers using the formula `a * b // gcd(a, b)`, and func_2 implements the main logic.

In func_2, the program first calculates the LCM of all the multipliers (den) using func_1. Then, it calculates the product of each multiplier and the LCM (vprod). The program then checks if the difference between the LCM and the sum of the products (den - sum(vprod)) is less than or equal to 0. If it is, the program prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required.

Otherwise, the program prints the products (vprod) as the bets for each outcome. The reasoning behind this is that the LCM (den) is the smallest number that is a multiple of all the multipliers. By betting the product of each multiplier and the LCM, the total amount of coins bet is guaranteed to be less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge case where the difference between the LCM and the sum of the products is less than or equal to 0. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
