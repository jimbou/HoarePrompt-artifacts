Output State: **`vals` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `N` is a positive integer equal to the number of elements in `vals`, `den` is the result of `func_1` applied to the first element of `vals` and the first element of `vals`, `x` is the first element of `vals`, stdin contains no input**

In this output state, the value of `den` has been updated to be the result of applying the function `func_1` to the original value of `den` (which was the first element of `vals`) and the value of `x` (which is also the first element of `vals`). The other variables remain unchanged.
