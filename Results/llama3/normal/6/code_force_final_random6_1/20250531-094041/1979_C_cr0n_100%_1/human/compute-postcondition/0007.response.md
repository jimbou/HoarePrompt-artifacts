Output State: **vals is a list of integers, N is a positive integer equal to the number of elements in vals, den is the result of func_1 applied to the result of func_1 applied to the result of func_1 applied to ... applied to the first element of vals and the first element of vals, and the second element of vals, and the third element of vals, ..., and the Nth element of vals, x is the Nth element of vals, stdin contains no input**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `vals` remains unchanged, the number of elements `N` in `vals` remains the same, the variable `den` is the result of applying the function `func_1` to the first element of `vals` and the first element of `vals`, then to the second element of `vals` and the result of the previous application, and so on, until the Nth element of `vals` is applied to the result of the previous application. The variable `x` is the Nth element of `vals`, and the standard input `stdin` remains empty.
