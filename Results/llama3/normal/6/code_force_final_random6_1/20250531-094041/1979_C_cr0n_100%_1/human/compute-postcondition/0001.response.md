To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `x` and the list `vals`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `vals`. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Since `N` is a positive integer equal to the number of elements in `vals`, we can infer that `vals` must have at least 1 element.

At the start of the loop, `x` will take on the value of the first element in `vals`, which is also the value of `den`.

State: **`vals` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `N` is a positive integer equal to the number of elements in `vals`, `den` is the first element of `vals`, `x` is the first element of `vals`, stdin contains no input**
