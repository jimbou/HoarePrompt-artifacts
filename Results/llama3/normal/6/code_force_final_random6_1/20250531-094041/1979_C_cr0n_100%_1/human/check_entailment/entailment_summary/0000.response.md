Reasoning:

The problem requires determining how to distribute coins in a game with n possible outcomes, each with a multiplier k_i, such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Function 1 calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two positive integers a and b, which is used in Function 2 to calculate the result of repeatedly applying the LCM function to the elements of a list of integers.

Function 2 uses the LCM result to calculate a new list of integers where each element is the integer division of the result by the corresponding element in the original list. If the result minus the sum of the new list is less than or equal to 0, it prints -1 and returns without modifying the original list. Otherwise, it prints the new list of integers.

The program is correct because it meets the problem description. The LCM calculation in Function 1 is correct, and Function 2 uses this result to calculate the new list of integers correctly. The program also handles the case where there is no way to distribute the coins as required by printing -1.

Correctness: **True**
