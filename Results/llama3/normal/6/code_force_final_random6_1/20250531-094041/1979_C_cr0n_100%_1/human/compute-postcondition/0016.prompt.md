You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: vals is a list of integers, N is a positive integer such that N = len(vals), and vals contains at least one element.
    N = int(input().strip())
    vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]
    den = vals[0]
    for x in vals:
        den = func_1(den, x)
        
    #State: vals is a list of integers, N is a positive integer equal to the number of elements in vals, den is the result of func_1 applied to the result of func_1 applied to the result of func_1 applied to ... applied to the first element of vals and the first element of vals, and the second element of vals, and the third element of vals, ..., and the Nth element of vals, x is the Nth element of vals, stdin contains no input
    vprod = [(den // r) for r in vals]
    den = den - sum(vprod)
    if (den <= 0) :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
        return
        #The program returns nothing because the return statement is empty. The value of den is still less than or equal to 0, and -1 has been printed. The list vals remains unchanged, and the value of x is still the Nth element of vals. The list vprod remains unchanged, and the value of N is still the number of elements in vals.
    #State: *vals is a list of integers, N is a positive integer equal to the number of elements in vals, den is the result of func_1 applied to the result of func_1 applied to the result of func_1 applied to ... applied to the first element of vals and the first element of vals, and the second element of vals, and the third element of vals, ..., and the Nth element of vals, minus the sum of the list vprod which is a list of integers where each element is the integer division of den by the corresponding element in vals, x is the Nth element of vals, stdin contains no input, vprod is a list of integers where each element is the integer division of the original value of den by the corresponding element in vals. den is larger than 0
    print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))
    #This is printed: [den//vals[0]] [den//vals[1]] [den//vals[2]] ... [den//vals[N-1]] (where den is the result of repeatedly applying func_1 to the elements of vals, and vals is a list of integers)

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns nothing because the return statement is empty. The value of den is still less than or equal to 0, and -1 has been printed. The list vals remains unchanged, and the value of x is still the Nth element of vals. The list vprod remains unchanged, and the value of N is still the number of elements in vals.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
