Output State: **vals is a list of integers, N is a positive integer equal to the number of elements in vals, den is the result of func_1 applied to the result of func_1 applied to the result of func_1 applied to ... applied to the first element of vals and the first element of vals, and the second element of vals, and the third element of vals, ..., and the Nth element of vals, minus the sum of the list vprod which is a list of integers where each element is the integer division of den by the corresponding element in vals, x is the Nth element of vals, stdin contains no input, vprod is a list of integers where each element is the integer division of the original value of den by the corresponding element in vals.**

In this output state, the value of `den` has been updated by subtracting the sum of the list `vprod` from its original value. The list `vprod` has been created by performing integer division of the original value of `den` by each element in the list `vals`. The values of `vals`, `N`, `x`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
