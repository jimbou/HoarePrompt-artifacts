Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: vals is a list of integers, N is a positive integer equal to the number of elements in vals, den is the first element of vals, stdin contains no input
Code of the loop:
for x in vals:
    den = func_1(den, x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `vals` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `N` is a positive integer equal to the number of elements in `vals`, `den` is the result of `func_1` applied to the first element of `vals` and the first element of `vals`, `x` is the first element of `vals`, stdin contains no input

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `vals` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `N` is a positive integer equal to the number of elements in `vals`, `den` is the result of `func_1` applied to the result of `func_1` applied to the second element of `vals` and the second element of `vals`, and the second element of `vals`, `x` is the second element of `vals`, `stdin` contains no input

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `vals` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `N` is a positive integer equal to the number of elements in `vals`, `den` is the result of `func_1` applied to the result of `func_1` applied to the result of `func_1` applied to the second element of `vals` and the second element of `vals`, and the second element of `vals`, and the third element of `vals`, `x` is the third element of `vals`, `stdin` contains no input




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
