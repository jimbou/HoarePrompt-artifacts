Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers between 0 and 9, and stdin contains no input. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are reassigned from the input, but since stdin contains no input, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are unknown. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`, then 'PEAK' is printed. Otherwise, 'NONE' is printed.**
