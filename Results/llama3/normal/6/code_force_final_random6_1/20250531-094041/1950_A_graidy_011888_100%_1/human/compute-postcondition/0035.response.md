Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is `n-1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers between 0 and 9, stdin contains no input. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, then 'STAIR' is printed. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`, then 'PEAK' is printed. Otherwise, 'NONE' is printed.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed `n` times, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000. After the loop finishes executing, the value of `i` is `n-1`, and the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers between 0 and 9. The stdin contains no input, as all input has been consumed by the loop. The output of the loop is determined by the conditions in the loop body, which print 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.
