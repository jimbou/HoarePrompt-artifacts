Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers between 0 and 9, stdin contains no input. Additionally, the relationship between `a`, `b`, and `c` is such that either `a` is not less than `b` or `b` is not less than `c`. The current value of `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`***
