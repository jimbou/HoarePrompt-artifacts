Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers between 0 and 9, stdin contains no input. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, then 'STAIR' is printed. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`, then 'PEAK' is printed. Otherwise, 'NONE' is printed.**

The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` assigns the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` to the input values from stdin, which are integers between 0 and 9. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. The conditions for printing 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' are still valid, as they depend on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, which have been updated. Since stdin contains no input, it remains empty.
