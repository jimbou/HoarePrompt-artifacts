Output: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers between 0 and 9, and stdin contains no input. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are reassigned from the input, but since stdin contains no input, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are unknown. The previous conditions for printing 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' are no longer valid since the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` have changed, and 'NONE' is printed**
