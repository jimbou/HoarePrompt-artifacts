Functionality: **This function reads a sequence of lines from standard input, where the first line contains an integer `n` between 1 and 1000, and each subsequent line contains three space-separated integers `a`, `b`, and `c` between 0 and 9. It then classifies each triplet into one of three categories: 'STAIR' if `a` < `b` < `c`, 'PEAK' if `a` < `b` > `c`, or 'NONE' otherwise, printing the corresponding classification for each triplet. The function does not return any value, and its purpose is to perform this classification and printing task.**
