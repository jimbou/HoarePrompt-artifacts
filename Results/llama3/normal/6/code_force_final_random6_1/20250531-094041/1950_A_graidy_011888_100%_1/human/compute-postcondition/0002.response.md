The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` assigns the values of three space-separated integers from the input to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`, respectively. Since the input is a sequence of lines each containing three space-separated integers (between 0 and 9), the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be integers between 0 and 9.

The values of `n` and `i` are not affected by this code, so they remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers between 0 and 9, stdin contains no input.**
