Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers between 0 and 9, stdin contains no input. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, then 'STAIR' is printed. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`, then 'PEAK' is printed. Otherwise, 'NONE' is printed.**
