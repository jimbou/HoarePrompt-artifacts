Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains one input: a sequence of lines each containing three space-separated integers (between 0 and 9)**

In this output state, the value of `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, which is obtained from the first input in the stdin. The stdin now contains only one input, which is a sequence of lines, each containing three space-separated integers between 0 and 9.
