Output State: **`stdin` is empty, `s` is a list of integers where all integers are either 0 or 1, `i` is equal to the length of `s`, `n` is equal to the number of 1's in `s`, and `ans` is the sum of all the numbers from 2 to `n+1` where `n` is the number of 1's in `s`**.

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the state of the variables is as follows: the input `stdin` remains empty, the list `s` remains unchanged with all integers being either 0 or 1, the loop counter `i` reaches the end of the list `s` (i.e., its value is equal to the length of `s`), the counter `n` accumulates the total number of 1's in the list `s`, and the answer `ans` calculates the sum of all numbers from 2 to `n+1`, where `n` is the total number of 1's in `s`.
