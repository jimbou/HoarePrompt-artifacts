Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t lines, each containing a binary string s (2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5; s_i in {0, 1}).**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The stdin still contains t lines, each containing a binary string s, with the same length and character constraints as before. The value of `t` is now known and is used to describe the remaining input in stdin.
