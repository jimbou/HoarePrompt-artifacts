Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. The problem asks for the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. However, the program does not consider the cost of the operations correctly.

In the function `func_1`, the program iterates over the input string and increments the answer whenever it encounters a '0' after a sequence of '1's. However, this approach does not take into account the cost of the operations. The program should consider the length of the substring being shifted, not just the number of '1's before a '0'.

For example, consider the input string "101011". The program will output 5, but the correct answer is 11. The optimal strategy is to shift the substring "101" to the right, which has a cost of 3, and then shift the substring "011" to the right, which has a cost of 3, and finally shift the substring "01" to the right, which has a cost of 2, and the substring "1" to the right, which has a cost of 1, and the substring "0" to the right, which has a cost of 2. The total cost is 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 11.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the problem description, and the correctness is **False**.
