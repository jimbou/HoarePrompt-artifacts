Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings.

Function 1 (`func_1`) takes a binary string as input, converts it into a list of integers, and then iterates over the list. It maintains a counter `n` to keep track of the number of consecutive 1's encountered so far. Whenever it encounters a 0 after a sequence of 1's, it increments the answer `ans` by `n + 1`, which represents the cost of shifting the sequence of 1's to the right of the 0.

Function 2 (`func_2`) reads the number of test cases `t` and calls Function 1 for each test case.

The program's logic is correct. It correctly identifies the sequences of 1's and 0's in the binary string and calculates the minimum cost to make the string sorted in non-descending order.

However, there is a small issue with the input handling. The problem statement specifies that the input is a binary string, but the program reads the input as a list of integers using `map(int, input().split())`. This would work correctly if the input is a space-separated list of binary digits, but it would fail if the input is a single binary string without spaces.

To fix this, the program should read the input as a string using `input()` and then iterate over the characters in the string.

Correctness: **False** (due to the input handling issue)

Note: If the input handling issue is fixed, the correctness would be **True**.
