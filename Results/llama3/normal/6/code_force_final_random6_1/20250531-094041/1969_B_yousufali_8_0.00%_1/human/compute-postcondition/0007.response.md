Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to 0, stdin contains 0 lines, and a function `func_1()` has been called and returned.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the value of `t` has been decremented to 0. The stdin buffer is empty, as all input lines have been processed. The function `func_1()` has been called and returned for each iteration, completing its execution.
