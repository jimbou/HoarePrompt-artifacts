Postcondition: ***`stdin` is empty, `s` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements where all integers are either 0 or 1, `i` is 2. If `s[i]` is 1, then `n` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, `n` is 1. If `s[i]` is 0 and `n` is not 0, then `ans` is either 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8. Otherwise, `ans` is either 2, 4 or 5.***
