Postcondition: ***`stdin` is empty, `s` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements where all integers are either 0 or 1, `ans` is either 2, 4 or 5, `n` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `s[i]` is 0 or 1 respectively, and `i` is 1. If `s[i]` is 0 and `n` is not 0, `ans` is either 4 or 5. Otherwise, `ans` remains 2.***
