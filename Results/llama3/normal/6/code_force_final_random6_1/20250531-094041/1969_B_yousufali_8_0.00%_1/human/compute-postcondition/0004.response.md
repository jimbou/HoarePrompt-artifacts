Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, stdin contains t lines, each containing a binary string s (2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5; s_i in {0, 1}), and a function `func_1()` has been called and returned.**

The code simply calls the function `func_1()` and does not modify any variables or the stdin. The function `func_1()` is called and returned, but its internal behavior is not specified, so we cannot determine any changes it may have made. The values of `t` and the contents of stdin remain the same.
