Output State: **`stdin` is empty, `s` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements where all integers are either 0 or 1, `ans` is either 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8, `i` is 2. If `s[i]` is 1, then `n` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, `n` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding `n + 1` to its initial value. Since `ans` was initially either 2, 4, or 5, and `n` is either 1, 2, or 3 depending on the value of `s[i]`, the new value of `ans` can be either 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8. The other variables remain unchanged.
