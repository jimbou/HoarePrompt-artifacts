Output State: **`stdin` is empty, `s` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements where all integers are either 0 or 1, `ans` is 2, `i` is 1, and `n` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `n` being equal to 2. The other variables remain unchanged, with `stdin` still being empty, `s` still being a list of integers with at least 2 elements where all integers are either 0 or 1, `ans` still being 2, and `i` still being 1.
