Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of each operation is equal to the length of the chosen substring.

Function 1 calculates the cost by iterating through the binary string. It keeps track of the number of consecutive 1's (n) and adds n + 1 to the answer whenever it encounters a 0 after a sequence of 1's. This is because the optimal strategy is to shift the entire sequence of 1's to the left of the 0, which costs n + 1.

Function 2 reads the number of test cases (t) and calls Function 1 for each test case.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the optimal strategy for solving the problem. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the binary string, which is efficient for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
