Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, stdin contains t lines, each containing a binary string s (2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5; s_i in {0, 1}), and a function `func_1()` has been called.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The stdin still contains `t` lines, each containing a binary string `s` with the specified length and characters. Additionally, the function `func_1()` has been executed, but its specific effects on the program state are not specified, so we simply note that it has been called.
