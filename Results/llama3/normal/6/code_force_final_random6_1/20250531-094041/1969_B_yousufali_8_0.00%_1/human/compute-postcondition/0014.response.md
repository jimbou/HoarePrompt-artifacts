The value of `n` is incremented by 1. The value of `n` can be 1 or 2, so the value of `n` is 2 or 3. Therefore, the Output State is: `stdin` is empty, `s` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements where all integers are either 0 or 1, `ans` is either 2, 4 or 5, `n` is either 2 or 3, and `i` is 2.
