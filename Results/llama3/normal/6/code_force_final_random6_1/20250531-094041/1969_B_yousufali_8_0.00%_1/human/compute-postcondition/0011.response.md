Output State: **`stdin` is empty, `s` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements where all integers are either 0 or 1, `ans` is either 4 or 5, `n` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `s[i]` is 0 or 1 respectively, and `i` is 1.**

The code `ans += n + 1` increments the value of `ans` by `n + 1`. Since `ans` is initially 2, and `n` is either 1 or 2, the new value of `ans` will be either 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 (if `n` is 1) or 2 + 2 + 1 = 5 (if `n` is 2). The other variables, `s`, `n`, and `i`, remain unchanged.
