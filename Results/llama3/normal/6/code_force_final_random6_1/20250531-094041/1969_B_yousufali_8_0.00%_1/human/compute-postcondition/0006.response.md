Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing a binary string s (2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5; s_i in {0, 1}), and a function `func_1()` has been called and returned.**

The code snippet is simply a function call to `func_1()`, which has already been called and returned. This means that the function has completed its execution and any changes it made to the program state have already been applied. Since the function call is not followed by any assignment or other statements, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

In other words, the function call `func_1()` does not modify the values of `t` or the contents of stdin, so they remain unchanged. The only difference is that the function call has been executed and returned, but this does not affect the overall program state.
