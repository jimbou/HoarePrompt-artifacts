The only variable in the loop head is variable `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be decreased by 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing a binary string s (2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5; s_i in {0, 1}), and a function `func_1()` has been called and returned.**
