Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of each operation is equal to the length of the chosen substring.

Function `func_1()` reads a binary string from standard input, calculates the sum of all numbers from 2 to the total count of 1s plus one, and prints the result. This function seems to be calculating the minimum total cost to make the string sorted.

Function `func_2()` reads an integer `t` from standard input, reads `t` lines of binary strings from standard input, and calls `func_1()` `t` times. This function appears to be the main function that handles multiple test cases.

However, there is a discrepancy between the problem description and the function `func_1()`. The problem description states that the input is a binary string, but `func_1()` reads a space-separated list of 0s and 1s from standard input. This suggests that the input format is not consistent with the problem description.

Moreover, the calculation performed by `func_1()` does not seem to match the problem description. The function calculates the sum of all numbers from 2 to the total count of 1s plus one, but the problem description requires finding the minimum total cost to make the string sorted by performing cyclic shifts on substrings.

Therefore, based on the provided execution summaries, it appears that the given program does not meet the problem description.
