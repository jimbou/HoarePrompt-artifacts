Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants according to their preferences. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` takes the number of extroverts and universals as input and returns the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate them. It first checks if the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3. If it's not, it checks if the remaining extroverts (i.e., `extroverts % 3`) plus the number of universals is less than 3. If it is, it returns `None`, indicating that it's impossible to accommodate the participants. Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the total number of extroverts and universals divided by 3, which represents the minimum number of tents needed.

`func_2` takes the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals as input and returns the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants. It first calls `func_1` with the number of extroverts and universals as input. If `func_1` returns `None`, it returns -1, indicating that it's impossible to accommodate the participants. Otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of introverts and the result of `func_1`, which represents the minimum number of tents needed.

The program correctly handles the following cases:

* If the number of extroverts is a multiple of 3, it can be accommodated in `extroverts // 3` tents.
* If the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3, it checks if the remaining extroverts plus the number of universals is less than 3. If it is, it's impossible to accommodate the participants.
* If the number of universals is sufficient to fill the remaining tents, it can be accommodated in the minimum number of tents needed.

However, the program does not handle the case where the number of universals is not sufficient to fill the remaining tents. In this case, it's impossible to accommodate the participants, but the program does not return -1.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
