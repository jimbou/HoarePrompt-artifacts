Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants according to their preferences. The given program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` takes two non-negative integers, `extroverts` and `universals`, as input. It checks if the current value of `extroverts` is not divisible by 3 and the sum of the remainder of `extroverts` divided by 3 and `universals` is less than 3. If this condition is met, it returns `None`. Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` divided by 3.

`func_2` takes three non-negative integers, `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals`, as input. It calls `func_1` with `extroverts` and `universals` as arguments and stores the result in `ret`. If `ret` is `None`, it returns -1. Otherwise, it returns the sum of `introverts` and `ret`.

The program correctly handles the cases where it is impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all their wishes (i.e., when `extroverts` is not divisible by 3 and the sum of the remainder of `extroverts` divided by 3 and `universals` is less than 3). In such cases, `func_1` returns `None`, and `func_2` returns -1.

For the cases where it is possible to accommodate the participants, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of tents needed. `func_1` groups `extroverts` and `universals` into sets of three, and `func_2` adds the number of `introverts` to the result, as each `introvert` needs a separate tent.

Therefore, the given program is correct, and the answer is:

Correctness: **True**
