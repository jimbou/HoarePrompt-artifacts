Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic to calculate the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants according to their preferences.

Function 1 (`func_1`) correctly handles the case where there are extroverts and universals. It checks if the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3, and if so, it checks if the remaining extroverts plus the universals can fill a tent. If not, it returns `None`. Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the total number of extroverts and universals divided by 3, which represents the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate them.

Function 2 (`func_2`) correctly combines the results of Function 1 with the number of introverts. If Function 1 returns `None`, it means that it is impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, so Function 2 returns -1. Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts to the result of Function 1, which represents the total minimum number of tents needed.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* When there are only introverts, the program returns the correct number of tents.
* When there are only extroverts, the program returns the correct number of tents.
* When there are only universals, the program returns 0, which is correct since universals can live alone.
* When there are a mix of introverts, extroverts, and universals, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants according to their preferences.

I couldn't find any case where the program does not work correctly, so I conclude that the program is correct.
