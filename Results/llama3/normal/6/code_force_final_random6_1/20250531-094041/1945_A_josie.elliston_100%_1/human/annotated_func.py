#State of the program right berfore the function call: extroverts and universals are non-negative integers
    if (extroverts % 3 != 0) :
        if (extroverts % 3 + universals < 3) :
            return None
            #The program returns None
        #State: extroverts and universals are non-negative integers. The current value of extroverts is not divisible by 3. The sum of the remainder of extroverts divided by 3 and universals is greater than or equal to 3
    #State: extroverts and universals are non-negative integers. If the current value of extroverts is not divisible by 3, the sum of the remainder of extroverts divided by 3 and universals is greater than or equal to 3.
    return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)
    #The program returns the ceiling of the sum of extroverts and universals divided by 3, where extroverts and universals are non-negative integers and if the current value of extroverts is not divisible by 3, the sum of the remainder of extroverts divided by 3 and universals is greater than or equal to 3.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes two non-negative integers, extroverts and universals, as input. If the current value of extroverts is not divisible by 3 and the sum of the remainder of extroverts divided by 3 and universals is less than 3, the function returns None. Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the sum of extroverts and universals divided by 3. The function effectively groups extroverts and universals into sets of three, returning the number of complete sets, unless the conditions for returning None are met.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: introverts, extroverts, and universals are non-negative integers.
    ret = func_1(extroverts, universals)
    return -1 if ret is None else introverts + ret
    #The program returns either -1 or the sum of introverts and the return value of func_1(extroverts, universals). The return value of func_1(extroverts, universals) is stored in ret, and introverts, extroverts, and universals are non-negative integers.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes three non-negative integers (introverts, extroverts, and universals) as input and returns either -1 or the sum of introverts and the result of calling another function (func_1) with extroverts and universals as arguments.
