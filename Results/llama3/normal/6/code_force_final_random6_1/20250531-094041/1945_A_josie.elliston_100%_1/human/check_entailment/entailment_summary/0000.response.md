Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants according to their preferences. The given program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2.

func_1 takes two non-negative integers, extroverts and universals, as input. It checks if the current value of extroverts is not divisible by 3 and the sum of the remainder of extroverts divided by 3 and universals is less than 3. If this condition is met, the function returns None. Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the sum of extroverts and universals divided by 3. This function effectively groups extroverts and universals into sets of three, returning the number of complete sets, unless the conditions for returning None are met.

func_2 takes three non-negative integers (introverts, extroverts, and universals) as input and returns either -1 or the sum of introverts and the result of calling func_1 with extroverts and universals as arguments.

The program uses func_2 to calculate the minimum number of tents needed for each test case. If func_1 returns None, func_2 returns -1, indicating that it is impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all their wishes. Otherwise, func_2 returns the sum of introverts and the result of func_1, which represents the minimum number of tents needed.

Based on the provided execution summaries, the program correctly implements the problem description. It handles the cases where it is impossible to accommodate the participants according to their preferences (returning -1) and calculates the minimum number of tents needed when it is possible to accommodate all participants.

Correctness: **True**
