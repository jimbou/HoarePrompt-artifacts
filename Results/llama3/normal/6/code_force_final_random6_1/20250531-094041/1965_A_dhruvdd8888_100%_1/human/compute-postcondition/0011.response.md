Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of n+1 integers with nums[i] equal to its original value plus the sum of all previous elements minus ls, ls is equal to (i+1) times its original value plus the sum of all previous elements minus the sum of all elements at indices greater than i, i is greater than 0, N is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, stdin contains t-n test cases, nw is True, cw is False, nums has at least 3 elements. The current value of nums[i] is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of numbers, the value of ls, the index i, the number N, the number of test cases in stdin, and the number of elements in nums remain unchanged. The only change is that the value of cw is now False, which is the opposite of the original value of nw, which is True.
