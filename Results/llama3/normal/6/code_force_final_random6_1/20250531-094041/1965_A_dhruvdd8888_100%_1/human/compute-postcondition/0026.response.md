Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of n+1 integers with nums[i] equal to its original value plus the sum of all previous elements minus ls, ls is equal to (i+1) times its original value plus the sum of all previous elements minus the sum of all elements at indices greater than i, i is equal to 1, N is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, stdin contains t-n test cases, nw is the opposite of its previous value, and cw is the opposite of its previous value, and nums has at least 3 elements. If the current value of nums[i] is 1, then cw is False and nw is False. Otherwise, cw is True and nw is True.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is: The list `nums` remains sorted with each element being its original value plus the sum of all previous elements minus `ls`. The value of `ls` is calculated based on its original value, the sum of all previous elements, and the sum of all elements at indices greater than `i`. The loop counter `i` reaches 1, and the other variables `N`, `stdin`, and `nums` remain unchanged. The values of `nw` and `cw` are toggled from their previous values, and if the current value of `nums[i]` is 1, both `nw` and `cw` are False; otherwise, they are True.
