Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of n+1 integers with nums[i] equal to its original value plus the sum of all previous elements minus ls, ls is equal to (i+1) times its original value plus the sum of all previous elements minus the sum of all elements at indices greater than i, i is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, N is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, stdin contains t-n test cases, nw is equal to cw, and nums has at least 3 elements. If the current value of nums[i] is 1, then cw is False. Otherwise, cw is True. nw is equal to cw.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of numbers `nums` remains sorted with the same number of elements, and its elements are still calculated based on the sum of previous elements and `ls`. The value of `ls` is still calculated based on its original value, previous elements, and elements at greater indices. The index `i` is still greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1. The number of test cases `N` is still between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, and there are still `t-n` test cases left in the standard input. The variable `nw` is now equal to `cw`, and `cw` is still True unless the current value of `nums[i]` is 1, in which case it is False. The list `nums` still has at least 3 elements.
