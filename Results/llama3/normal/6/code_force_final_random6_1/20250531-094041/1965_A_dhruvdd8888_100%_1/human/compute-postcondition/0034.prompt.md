You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 2*10^5) and then a space-separated list of n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).
    N = int(input())
    nums = set(input().split())
    nums.add('0')
    nums = sorted(map(int, nums))
    ls = 0
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        nums[i] -= ls
        
        ls += nums[i]
        
    #State: nums is a sorted list of n+1 integers with nums[i] equal to its original value plus the sum of all previous elements minus ls, ls is equal to (i+1) times its original value plus the sum of all previous elements minus the sum of all elements at indices greater than i, i is equal to n, N is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, stdin contains t-n test cases.
    nw = True
    cw = True
    for i in range(len(nums) - 2, 0, -1):
        if nums[i] == 1:
            cw = not nw
        else:
            cw = True
        
        nw = cw
        
    #State: `nums` is a sorted list of n+1 integers with nums[i] equal to its original value plus the sum of all previous elements minus ls, ls is equal to (i+1) times its original value plus the sum of all previous elements minus the sum of all elements at indices greater than i, i is equal to 1, N is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, stdin contains t-n test cases, nw is the opposite of its previous value, and cw is the opposite of its previous value, and nums has at least 3 elements. If the current value of nums[i] is 1, then cw is False and nw is False. Otherwise, cw is True and nw is True.
    if cw :
        print('Alice')
        #This is printed: Alice
    else :
        print('Bob')
        #This is printed: Bob
    #State: nums is a sorted list of n+1 integers with nums[i] equal to its original value plus the sum of all previous elements minus ls, ls is equal to (i+1) times its original value plus the sum of all previous elements minus the sum of all elements at indices greater than i, i is equal to 1, N is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, stdin contains t-n test cases, nw is the opposite of its previous value, and cw is the opposite of its previous value, and nums has at least 3 elements. If the current value of nums[i] is 1, then nw is False and cw is False. Otherwise, nw is True and cw is True. Additionally, if cw is True, then 'Alice' is printed and nw is True if nums[i] is not 1. If cw is False, then 'Bob' is printed.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: nums is a sorted list of n+1 integers with nums[i] equal to its original value plus the sum of all previous elements minus ls, ls is equal to (i+1) times its original value plus the sum of all previous elements minus the sum of all elements at indices greater than i, i is equal to 1, N is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, stdin contains t-n test cases, nw is the opposite of its previous value, and cw is the opposite of its previous value, and nums has at least 3 elements. The current value of cw is True. If the current value of nums[i] is 1, then nw is False. Otherwise, nw is True, and 'Alice' is being printed

Case_2: `nums` is a sorted list of n+1 integers with nums[i] equal to its original value plus the sum of all previous elements minus ls, ls is equal to (i+1) times its original value plus the sum of all previous elements minus the sum of all elements at indices greater than i, i is equal to 1, N is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, stdin contains t-n test cases, nw is the opposite of its previous value, and cw is the opposite of its previous value, and nums has at least 3 elements. If the current value of nums[i] is 1, then cw is False and nw is False. Otherwise, cw is True and nw is True. Additionally, cw is False. and 'Bob' is being printed


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
