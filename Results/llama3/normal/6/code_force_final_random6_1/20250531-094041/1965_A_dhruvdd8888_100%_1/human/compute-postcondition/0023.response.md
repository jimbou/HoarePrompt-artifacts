Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of n+1 integers with nums[i] equal to its original value plus the sum of all previous elements minus ls, ls is equal to (i+1) times its original value plus the sum of all previous elements minus the sum of all elements at indices greater than i, i is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, N is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, stdin contains t-n test cases, nw is equal to True, cw is True, and nums has at least 3 elements. If the current value of nums[i] is 1, then nw is False.**

In this output state, the value of `cw` has been changed to True. The value of `nw` is still equal to `cw`, so it is also True. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that the condition "If the current value of nums[i] is 1, then cw is False" is no longer applicable because `cw` has been explicitly set to True.
