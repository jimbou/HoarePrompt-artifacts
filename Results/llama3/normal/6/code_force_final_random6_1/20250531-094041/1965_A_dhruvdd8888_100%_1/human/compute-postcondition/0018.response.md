Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of n+1 integers with nums[i] equal to its original value plus the sum of all previous elements minus ls, ls is equal to (i+1) times its original value plus the sum of all previous elements minus the sum of all elements at indices greater than i, i is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, N is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, stdin contains t-n test cases, nw is equal to True, and nums has at least 3 elements. If the current value of nums[i] is 1, then cw is False. Otherwise, cw is True.**

In this output state, the value of `cw` is set to `True`, regardless of the previous value of `nums[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their original values and relationships. The condition that `cw` is `False` when `nums[i]` is 1 is no longer applicable, as `cw` is now explicitly set to `True`.
