To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `nums`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than 0 and `nums` has at least 3 elements.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of n+1 integers with nums[i] equal to its original value plus the sum of all previous elements minus ls, ls is equal to (i+1) times its original value plus the sum of all previous elements minus the sum of all elements at indices greater than i, i is greater than 0, N is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, stdin contains t-n test cases, nw is True, cw is True, nums has at least 3 elements**
