Output State: **nums is a sorted list of n+1 integers with nums[i] equal to its original value plus the sum of all previous elements minus ls, ls is equal to (i+1) times its original value plus the sum of all previous elements minus the sum of all elements at indices greater than i, i is equal to n, N is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, stdin contains t-n test cases.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a sorted list of n+1 integers where each element is modified based on the sum of its previous elements and the running sum ls. The running sum ls is updated to be (i+1) times its original value plus the sum of all previous elements minus the sum of all elements at indices greater than i. The loop counter i is equal to n, indicating that the loop has executed n times. The other variables, N and stdin, remain unchanged.
