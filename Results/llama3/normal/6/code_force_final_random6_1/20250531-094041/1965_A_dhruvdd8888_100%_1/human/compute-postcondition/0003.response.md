The only objects in the loop head are variables  i and nums, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the nums.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, nums has at least 1 element, ls is the value of nums[i], i is 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the index is 1 and ls is the second element in the list.
State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, N is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, nums is a sorted list of n+1 integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^9) including 0 that must have at least 2 elements, ls is the value of nums[1], i is 1**
