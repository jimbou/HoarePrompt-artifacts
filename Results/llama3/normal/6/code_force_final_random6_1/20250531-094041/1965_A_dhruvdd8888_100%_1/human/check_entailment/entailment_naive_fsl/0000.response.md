Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine the winner of the game. The issue lies in the way the program calculates the `nums` list and the `ls` variable. The `nums` list is created by sorting the input numbers and adding a '0' to the set, which is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results. The `ls` variable is used to keep track of the cumulative sum of the numbers, but it is not used correctly in the calculation of the `nums` list.

A correct approach would be to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the numbers in the input list. If the GCD is 1, then Alice can win by choosing k=1 on her first turn. If the GCD is greater than 1, then Bob can win by choosing k=GCD on his first turn.

Here is an example of a case where the program does not work correctly:

Input:

    2
    2
    2 4

Output:

    Bob

Expected Output:

    Alice

In this case, the program incorrectly determines that Bob wins, when in fact Alice can win by choosing k=2 on her first turn.
