To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `nums`. The loop will execute if `nums` has at least one element. Since `nums` is a sorted list of `n+1` integers, we can adjust the state of `nums` to have at least one element.

State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, N is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, nums is a sorted list of n+1 integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^9) including 0 that must have at least 1 element, ls is 0, i is 0**
