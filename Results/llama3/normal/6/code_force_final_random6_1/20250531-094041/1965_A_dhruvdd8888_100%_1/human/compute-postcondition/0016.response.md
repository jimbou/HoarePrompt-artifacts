To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(len(nums) - 2, 0, -1):`. This means that the loop will iterate from `len(nums) - 2` down to `1` (since the upper bound is exclusive).

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is greater than `0`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be decremented by `1`, since the loop iterates in reverse order.

The other objects in the loop head are `nums` and `len(nums)`. Since `nums` is a sorted list of `n+1` integers, its length is fixed and does not change. Therefore, we do not need to adjust the state of `nums` or `len(nums)`.

The state of `ls`, `N`, `stdin`, `nw`, and `cw` are not affected by the loop head, so we do not need to adjust their states.

The state of `nums` having at least `3` elements is still true, since the length of `nums` does not change.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of n+1 integers with nums[i] equal to its original value plus the sum of all previous elements minus ls, ls is equal to (i+1) times its original value plus the sum of all previous elements minus the sum of all elements at indices greater than i, i is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, N is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, stdin contains t-n test cases, nw is equal to cw, and nums has at least 3 elements. If the current value of nums[i] is 1, then cw is False. Otherwise, cw is True.**
