The first line subtracts the value of `ls` from `nums[i]`, modifying the value of `nums[i]`. Since `ls` is 0, `nums[i]` remains unchanged. The second line adds the value of `nums[i]` to `ls`, making `ls` equal to the value of `nums[i]`.

Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, N is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, nums is a sorted list of n+1 integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^9) including 0 that must have at least 1 element, ls is the value of nums[i], i is 0**
