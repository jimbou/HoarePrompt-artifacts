Output State: **nums is a sorted list of n+1 integers with nums[2] equal to its original value plus nums[1] minus ls, nums[1] is equal to its original value minus nums[2], ls is equal to three times its original value plus nums[1] minus nums[2], i is 2, N is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, stdin contains t-2 test cases**

In this output state, the value of nums[2] has been modified by subtracting ls from it. The value of ls has been updated by adding nums[i] (which is nums[2]) to it. The value of nums[1] remains unchanged. The value of i remains unchanged as 2. The value of N remains unchanged as an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive. The stdin remains unchanged with t-2 test cases.
