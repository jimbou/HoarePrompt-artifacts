Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of n+1 integers with nums[i] equal to its original value plus the sum of all previous elements minus ls, ls is equal to (i+1) times its original value plus the sum of all previous elements minus the sum of all elements at indices greater than i, i is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, N is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, stdin contains t-n test cases, nw is equal to cw, and nums has at least 3 elements. If the current value of nums[i] is 1, then cw is False. Otherwise, cw is True. nw is equal to cw. cw is now the opposite of its previous value.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of numbers, the value of ls, the index i, the number of test cases N, the number of test cases left in stdin, and the number of elements in nums are all the same as before. However, the value of cw has been flipped, i.e., it is now the opposite of its previous value. The value of nw is still equal to cw.
