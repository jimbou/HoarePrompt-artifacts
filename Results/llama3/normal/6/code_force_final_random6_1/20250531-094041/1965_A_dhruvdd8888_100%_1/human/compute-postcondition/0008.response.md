Output State: **nums is a sorted list of n+1 integers with nums[i] equal to its original value plus the sum of all previous elements minus ls, ls is equal to (i+1) times its original value plus the sum of all previous elements minus the sum of all elements at indices greater than i, i is equal to n, N is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, stdin contains t-n test cases, nw is True, cw is True.**

The code snippet does not modify any of the existing variables or their values. It only introduces two new boolean variables, `nw` and `cw`, and assigns them the value `True`. The rest of the state remains unchanged, including the values of `nums`, `ls`, `i`, `N`, and the contents of `stdin`.
