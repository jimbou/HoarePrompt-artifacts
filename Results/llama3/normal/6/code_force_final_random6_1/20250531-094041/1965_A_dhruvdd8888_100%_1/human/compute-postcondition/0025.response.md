Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of n+1 integers with nums[i] equal to its original value plus the sum of all previous elements minus ls, ls is equal to (i+1) times its original value plus the sum of all previous elements minus the sum of all elements at indices greater than i, i is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, N is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, stdin contains t-n test cases, nw is the opposite of its previous value, and cw is the opposite of its previous value, and nums has at least 3 elements. If the current value of nums[i] is 1, then cw is False and nw is False. Otherwise, cw is True and nw is True.**

In this output state, the value of `nw` is updated to be the opposite of its previous value, which is the same as the previous value of `cw`. The value of `cw` is also updated to be the opposite of its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.
