Output: **nums is a sorted list of n+1 integers with nums[i] equal to its original value plus the sum of all previous elements minus ls, ls is equal to (i+1) times its original value plus the sum of all previous elements minus the sum of all elements at indices greater than i, i is equal to 1, N is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, stdin contains t-n test cases, nw is the opposite of its previous value, and cw is the opposite of its previous value, and nums has at least 3 elements. The current value of cw is True. If the current value of nums[i] is 1, then nw is False. Otherwise, nw is True, and 'Alice' is being printed**
