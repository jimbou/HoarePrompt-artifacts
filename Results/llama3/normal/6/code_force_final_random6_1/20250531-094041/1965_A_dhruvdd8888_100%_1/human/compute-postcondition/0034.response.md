Functionality: **This function determines the winner of a game based on a list of integers. It takes no parameters and returns no value, but instead prints the name of the winner ('Alice' or 'Bob'). The function reads input from stdin, processes it, and then prints the result. The input is expected to contain a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer n followed by a list of n integers. The function modifies the input list by adding a '0' element, sorting it, and then transforming the values based on their position in the list. It then iterates over the list in reverse order, updating two boolean variables (nw and cw) based on the values in the list. Finally, it prints the name of the winner based on the value of the cw variable.**
