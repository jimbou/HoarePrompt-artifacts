Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of n+1 integers with nums[i] equal to its original value plus the sum of all previous elements minus ls, ls is equal to (i+1) times its original value plus the sum of all previous elements minus the sum of all elements at indices greater than i, i is greater than 0, N is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, stdin contains t-n test cases, nw is True, cw is True, nums has at least 3 elements, and nums[i] is not equal to 1**

The code simply assigns the value True to the variable cw. The values of the other variables are not affected. The output state is the same as the initial state, with the only change being that cw is now explicitly stated to be True.
