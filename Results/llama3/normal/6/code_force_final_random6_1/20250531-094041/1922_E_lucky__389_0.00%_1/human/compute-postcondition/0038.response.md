The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` was 2, so the new value of `i` is 3. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 3, `stdin` contains either 1 input: an integer or 0 inputs, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 5, `subseq_lens` is a list, `mx` is at least 0.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `stdin` contains either 1 input: an integer or 0 inputs, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 5, `subseq_lens` is a list, `mx` is at least 0**
