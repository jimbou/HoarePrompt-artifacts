Output State: `stdin` contains 1 input: an integer, `x` is an integer equal to its original value minus the number of iterations of the loop and its original value must have been greater than 2 and `x` currently must be at least 0, `subseq_lens` is a list, `mx` is the maximum of 0 and the greatest integer `i` such that 2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1, `i` is increased by the number of iterations of the loop.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `x` has been decremented by the number of iterations of the loop, `i` has been incremented by the number of iterations of the loop, and `mx` is the maximum of 0 and the greatest integer `i` such that 2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
