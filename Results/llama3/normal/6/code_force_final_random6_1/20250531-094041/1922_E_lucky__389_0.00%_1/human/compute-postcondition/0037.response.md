According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If 2 ** (i + 1) is less than or equal to `x` + 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 3. `x` being greater than or equal to 3 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `x` is greater than or equal to 5. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`i` is 2, `stdin` contains either 1 input: an integer or 0 inputs, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 5, `subseq_lens` is a list, `mx` is at least 0**
