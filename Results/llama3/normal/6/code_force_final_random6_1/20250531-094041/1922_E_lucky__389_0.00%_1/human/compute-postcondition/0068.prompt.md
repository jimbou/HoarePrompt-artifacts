You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) and then t lines each containing an integer X (2 <= X <= 10^18).
    x = int(input())
    x -= 1
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        
        while 2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1:
            i += 1
        
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i)
            x -= 2 ** i - 1
            mx = max(mx, i)
        
    #State: stdin contains 1 input: an integer, x is 0, subseq_lens is a list of integers, mx is the maximum of 0 and the greatest integer i such that 2^i - 1 <= x
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
        
    #State: x is 0, subseq_lens is a list of integers, mx is 0, ansv is a list containing an empty list and all elements of subseq_lens except the first one, i is len(subseq_lens) - 1, stdin contains 1 input: an integer.
    print(len(ansv))
    #This is printed: len(subseq_lens) - 1
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing, and the output state is: `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list of integers, `mx` is 0, `ansv` is a list containing an empty list and all elements of `subseq_lens` except the first one, `i` is equal to the length of `subseq_lens`, `stdin` contains 1 input: an integer, and all elements of `ansv` have been printed.
    print()
    #This is printed: a blank line

```

Return Postconditions: The loop has finished executing, and the output state is: `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list of integers, `mx` is 0, `ansv` is a list containing an empty list and all elements of `subseq_lens` except the first one, `i` is equal to the length of `subseq_lens`, `stdin` contains 1 input: an integer, and all elements of `ansv` have been printed.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Use Natural language easily understandable by humans and strictly reply with the format: Functionality: ** your response here **
