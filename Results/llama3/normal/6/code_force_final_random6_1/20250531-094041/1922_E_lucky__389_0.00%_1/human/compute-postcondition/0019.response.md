Output State: **`stdin` contains 1 input: an integer, `x` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1 and its original value must have been greater than 2 and `x` currently must be greater than 0, `subseq_lens` is a list, `mx` must be at least 0, `i` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains one input, an integer. The original value of `x` was greater than 2, and its current value is greater than 0. The list `subseq_lens` and the value of `mx` (which is at least 0) are also unchanged.
