Output State: **`stdin` contains 1 input: an integer, `x` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1 and its original value must have been greater than 2 and `x` currently must be at least 3, `subseq_lens` is a list, `mx` must be at least 0, `i` is increased by 3**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been increased by 1 from its previous state where it was increased by 2, resulting in a total increase of 3. The other variables remain unchanged, with `x` still being an integer equal to its original value minus 1, `subseq_lens` remaining a list, `mx` being at least 0, and `stdin` still containing 1 input: an integer.
