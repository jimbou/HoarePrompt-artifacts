Output State: **x is an integer equal to its original value minus the number of times the loop executes times (2 to the power of the number of times the loop executes minus 1), subseq_lens is a list with i appended to it, mx is the maximum of its original value and i, i is increased by the number of times the loop executes, and stdin contains 0 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been decreased by the number of times the loop executes times (2 to the power of the number of times the loop executes minus 1), which is a result of the second line of the code. The list `subseq_lens` has been appended with the value of `i`, which is a result of the first line of the code. The value of `mx` has been updated to be the maximum of its original value and `i`, which is a result of the third line of the code. The value of `i` has been increased by the number of times the loop executes, which is a result of the loop itself. Finally, the stdin contains 0 inputs, as the input has been consumed by the loop.
