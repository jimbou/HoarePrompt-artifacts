Postcondition: ***`stdin` contains either 1 input: an integer or 0 inputs, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `subseq_lens` is a list, `mx` is at least 0, `i` is increased by the number of times the loop executes. If `i` is 0, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `x` is reduced by the number of times the loop executes times (2 to the power of the number of times the loop executes minus 1), `subseq_lens` is appended with `i`, and `mx` is the maximum of its original value and `i`.***
