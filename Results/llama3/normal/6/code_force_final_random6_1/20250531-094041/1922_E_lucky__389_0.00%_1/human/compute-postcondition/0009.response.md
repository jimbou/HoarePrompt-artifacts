Output State: `stdin` contains 1 input: an integer, `x` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1 and its original value must have been greater than 1, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, `i` is the largest integer such that 2 ** (i + 1) is less than or equal to `x` + 1.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `i` will be the largest integer such that 2 to the power of `i` + 1 is less than or equal to the original value of `x` plus 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
