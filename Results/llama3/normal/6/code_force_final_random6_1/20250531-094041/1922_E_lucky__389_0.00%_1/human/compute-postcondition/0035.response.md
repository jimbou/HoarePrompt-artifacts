The variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `2 ** (i + 1)` is less than or equal to `x + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1. `i` being 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 1 and `x` must be greater than or equal to 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`stdin` contains either 1 input: an integer or 0 inputs, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `subseq_lens` is a list, `mx` is at least 0, `i` is 1**
