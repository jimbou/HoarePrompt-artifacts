The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is 0, so the new value of `i` is 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains either 1 input: an integer or 0 inputs. The value of `x` is still an integer greater than or equal to 1. The value of `subseq_lens` is still a list. The value of `mx` is still at least 0. 

Output State: **`stdin` contains either 1 input: an integer or 0 inputs, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `subseq_lens` is a list, `mx` is at least 0, `i` is 1**
