The code prints the length of the list `ansv`. The list `ansv` is defined as containing an empty list and all elements of `subseq_lens` except the first one. Since `i` is equal to `len(subseq_lens) - 1`, `ansv` will contain all elements of `subseq_lens` except the first one. Therefore, the length of `ansv` will be equal to the length of `subseq_lens` minus one.

Output: **len(subseq_lens) - 1**
