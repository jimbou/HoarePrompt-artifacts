Postcondition: ***`i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(x + 1) - 1, `stdin` contains either 1 input: an integer or 0 inputs, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `subseq_lens` is a list, `mx` is at least 0. If `i` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `subseq_lens` is a list with `i` appended to the end, and `x` is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus 2.***
