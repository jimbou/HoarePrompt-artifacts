This function reads an integer t from standard input, then reads t lines each containing an integer X. It decomposes each X into a sequence of integers representing the lengths of subsequences, where each subsequence is a contiguous sequence of bits in the binary representation of X. The function then prints the length of the sequence of subsequence lengths, followed by the sequence of subsequence lengths, excluding the first subsequence length. Finally, it prints a blank line.
