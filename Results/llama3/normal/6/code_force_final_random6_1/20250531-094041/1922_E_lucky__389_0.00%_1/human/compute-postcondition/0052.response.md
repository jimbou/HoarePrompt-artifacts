Output State: **`x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `mx` is 0, `ansv` is a list containing an empty list, the second element of `subseq_lens`, the third element of `subseq_lens`, and the fourth element of `subseq_lens`, `i` is 3, stdin contains 1 input: an integer**

In this output state, the value of `ansv` has been updated by appending the fourth element of `subseq_lens` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains one input: an integer.
