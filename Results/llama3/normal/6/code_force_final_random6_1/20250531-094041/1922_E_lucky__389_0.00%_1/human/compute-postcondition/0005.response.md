According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `x`. If `2 ** (i + 1)` is less than or equal to `x + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `x` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1 and its original value must have been greater than 1. `i` being 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 1 and `2 ** (i + 1)` is less than or equal to `x + 1`. `x` being an integer equal to its original value minus 1 and its original value must have been greater than 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `x` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1 and its original value must have been greater than 2 ** (i + 1) - 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`stdin` contains 1 input: an integer, `x` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1 and its original value must have been greater than 2 ** (i + 1) - 1, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, `i` is 1**
