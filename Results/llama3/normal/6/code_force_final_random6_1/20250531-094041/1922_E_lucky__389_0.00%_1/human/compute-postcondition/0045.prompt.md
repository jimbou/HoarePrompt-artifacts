Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains 1 input: an integer, x is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, subseq_lens is an empty list, mx is 0
Code of the loop:
while x != 0:
    i = 0
    while 2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1:
        i += 1
    if i == 0:
        break
    else:
        subseq_lens.append(i)
        x -= 2 ** i - 1
        mx = max(mx, i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`stdin` contains 1 input: an integer, `x` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1 and its original value must have been greater than 1, `subseq_lens` is a list, `mx` is the maximum of 0 and the greatest integer `i` such that 2
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`stdin` contains either 1 input: an integer or 0 inputs, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `subseq_lens` is a list, `mx` is at least 0, `i` is increased by the number of times the loop executes. If `i` is 0, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `x` is reduced by the number of times the loop executes times (2 to the power of the number of times the loop executes minus 1), `subseq_lens` is appended with `i`, and `mx` is the maximum of its original value and `i`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(x + 1) - 1, `stdin` contains either 1 input: an integer or 0 inputs, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `subseq_lens` is a list, `mx` is at least 0. If `i` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `subseq_lens` is a list with `i` appended to the end, and `x` is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus 2.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
