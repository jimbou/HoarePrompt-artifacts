The first line adds the value of `i` to the end of the list `subseq_lens`. The second line subtracts the value of `2 ** i - 1` from `x`. The third line assigns the maximum value between `mx` and `i` to `mx`.

Output State: **`i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(x + 1) - 1, `subseq_lens` is a list with `i` appended to the end, `x` is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus 2 ** i - 1, `mx` is at least 0 and equal to the maximum of its original value and `i`, and `stdin` contains either 1 input: an integer or 0 inputs.**
