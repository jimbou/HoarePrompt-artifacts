The variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If 2 to the power of `i + 1` is less than or equal to `x + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is increased by 1, `x` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1 and its original value must have been greater than 2 and `x` currently must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i` is increased by 1 and `x` needs to be adjusted to `x` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1 and its original value must have been greater than 2 and `x` currently must be greater than 1.
State: **`stdin` contains 1 input: an integer, `x` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1 and its original value must have been greater than 2 and `x` currently must be greater than 1, `subseq_lens` is a list, `mx` must be at least 0, `i` is increased by 1**
