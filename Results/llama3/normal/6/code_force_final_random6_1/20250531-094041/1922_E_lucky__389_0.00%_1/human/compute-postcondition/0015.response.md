Postcondition: ***`stdin` contains 1 input: an integer, `x` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1 and its original value must have been greater than 1, `subseq_lens` is a list, `mx` is the maximum of 0 and the greatest integer `i` such that 2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1, and `i` is the greatest integer `i` such that 2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1. If `i` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `x` is updated to its original value minus 1 minus 2 to the power of `i` minus 1, and `subseq_lens` contains `i`.***
