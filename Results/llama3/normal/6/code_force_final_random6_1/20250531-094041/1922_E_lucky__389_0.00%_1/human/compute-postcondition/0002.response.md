Output State: **`stdin` contains 1 input: an integer, `x` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1 and its original value must have been greater than 1, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, `i` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been updated to 0, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains one input: an integer. The value of `x` is still an integer equal to its original value minus 1, and its original value must have been greater than 1. The list `subseq_lens` is still empty, and `mx` is still 0.
