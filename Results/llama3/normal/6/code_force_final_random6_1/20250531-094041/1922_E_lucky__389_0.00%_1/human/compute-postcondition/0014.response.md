Output State: **x is an integer equal to its original value minus 1 minus 2 to the power of i minus 1, and its original value must have been greater than 1, subseq_lens is a list containing i, mx is the maximum of 0 and i, stdin contains 1 input: an integer, and i is the greatest integer i such that 2 to the power of i is less than or equal to x plus 1.**

The first line adds the value of `i` to the `subseq_lens` list. The second line subtracts `2` to the power of `i` minus `1` from `x`. The third line updates `mx` to be the maximum of its current value and `i`. Since `i` is the greatest integer such that `2` to the power of `i` is less than or equal to `x` plus `1`, the value of `x` after the second line is still an integer equal to its original value minus `1` minus `2` to the power of `i` minus `1`, and its original value must have been greater than `1`. The value of `mx` is now the maximum of `0` and `i`. The value of `stdin` remains unchanged, containing `1` input: an integer.
