The variable in the loop head is variable x, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable x.  If x is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, x is an integer equal to its original value minus 1 and its original value must have been greater than 1, So for the loop to be executed one more time the original value of x needed to have been greater than 2 and x currently must be greater than 0.
State: **`stdin` contains 1 input: an integer, `x` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1 and its original value must have been greater than 2 and x currently must be greater than 0, `subseq_lens` is a list, `mx` is the maximum of 0 and the greatest integer `i` such that 2**i is less than or equal to x**
