Output State: **stdin contains 1 input: an integer, x is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, subseq_lens is an empty list, mx is 0**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `x`. Since `x` is an integer, its value is now one less than the original value. The second line decrements `x` by 1, making it equal to its original value minus 1. The third line initializes an empty list `subseq_lens`. The fourth line initializes `mx` to 0. No other variables are affected.
