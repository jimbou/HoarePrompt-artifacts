The variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `2 ** (i + 1)` is less than or equal to `x + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is increased by 2, and `x` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1 and its original value must have been greater than 2 and `x` currently must be greater than 1. 

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to make sure that `2 ** (i + 1)` is still less than or equal to `x + 1`. Since `i` is increased by 2, we need to make sure that `x` is large enough to satisfy the condition. 

Since `x` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1 and its original value must have been greater than 2 and `x` currently must be greater than 1, we can conclude that `x` must be at least 3.

State: **`stdin` contains 1 input: an integer, `x` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1 and its original value must have been greater than 2 and `x` currently must be at least 3, `subseq_lens` is a list, `mx` must be at least 0, `i` is increased by 2**
