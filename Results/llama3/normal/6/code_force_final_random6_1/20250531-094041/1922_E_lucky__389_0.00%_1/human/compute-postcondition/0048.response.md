Output State: **stdin contains 1 input: an integer, x is 0, subseq_lens is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, mx is 0, ansv is a list containing an empty list and the second element of subseq_lens, i is 1**

In this output state, the value of `ansv` has been updated by appending the second element of `subseq_lens` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains one input: an integer. The value of `i` is still 1, and the values of `x` and `mx` are still 0. The list `subseq_lens` still has at least 2 elements.
