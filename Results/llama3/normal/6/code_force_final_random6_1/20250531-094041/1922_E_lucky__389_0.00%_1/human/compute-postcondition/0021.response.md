Output State: **`stdin` contains 1 input: an integer, `x` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1 and its original value must have been greater than 2 and `x` currently must be greater than 1, `subseq_lens` is a list, `mx` must be at least 0, `i` is increased by 2**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been increased by 1 from its previous state, where it was already increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains 1 input: an integer. The value of `x` is still an integer equal to its original value minus 1, and its original value must have been greater than 2, and `x` currently must be greater than 1. The list `subseq_lens` and the value of `mx` also remain the same.
