Output State: **`stdin` contains 1 input: an integer, `x` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1 and its original value must have been greater than 2 and x currently must be greater than 0, `subseq_lens` is a list, `mx` is the maximum of 0 and the greatest integer `i` such that 2**i is less than or equal to `x`, `i` is 0**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that `i` is now 0. The values of `stdin`, `x`, `subseq_lens`, and `mx` remain unchanged, as they were not affected by the code.
