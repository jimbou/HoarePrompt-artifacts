Output State: **`t` is an integer larger than 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers and its first element is removed, `res` is 0, `i` is undefined, `_` is 2, and `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases**

In this output state, the first element of the list `a` is removed using the `pop(0)` method. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` is still non-empty, but its first element is no longer 0. The other variables, including `t`, `n`, `res`, `i`, and `_`, retain their original values. The number of test cases in `stdin` also remains the same, which is `t-6`.
