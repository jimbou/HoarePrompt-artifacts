Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the cell values `a`.
3. It removes leading and trailing zeros from the list `a` using `pop(0)` and `pop()`. This is done to ignore the free cells at the beginning and end of the ribbon.
4. It then counts the number of zeros in the remaining list `a` using a simple loop. This count represents the minimum number of operations required to move the chips to form a single block.
5. Finally, it prints the count for each test case.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
