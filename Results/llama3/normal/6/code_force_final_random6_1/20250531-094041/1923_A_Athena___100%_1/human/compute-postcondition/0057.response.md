The code prints the value of `res`, which is equal to the number of zeros in the list `a`.
Since the list `a` has all trailing zeros removed, the number of zeros in `a` is the count of zeros in the list excluding any trailing zeros.
Output: **the number of zeros in the list a (excluding any trailing zeros)**
