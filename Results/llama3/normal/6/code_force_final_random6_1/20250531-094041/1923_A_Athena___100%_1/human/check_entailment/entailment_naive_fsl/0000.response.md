Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them. Here's why:

1. The program first removes any leading or trailing zeros from the input list `a`. This is because these zeros do not affect the minimum number of operations required.

2. Then, it iterates through the remaining list and counts the number of zeros. Each zero represents a free cell that needs to be filled by moving a chip to its left. Therefore, the count of zeros is equal to the minimum number of operations required.

3. The program prints the count of zeros as the result.

The program handles all possible cases correctly:

* If there are no free cells between the chips, the count of zeros will be 0, and the program will print 0.
* If there are free cells between the chips, the count of zeros will be greater than 0, and the program will print the correct minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
