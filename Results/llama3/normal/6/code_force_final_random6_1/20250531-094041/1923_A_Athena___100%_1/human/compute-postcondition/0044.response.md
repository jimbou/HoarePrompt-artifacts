Output State: **`t` is an integer larger than 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with all leading zeros removed and has a length of at least `i-1`, `i` is greater than 1 and equal to the length of `a` minus one, `res` is 0, `_` is 1, and `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases.**

The value of `a` is updated by removing the last element from the list using the `pop()` method. The length of `a` is now `i-1` since one element has been removed. The other variables remain unchanged.
