To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `a` and the condition `a[0] == 0`.

According to the code, the loop can execute if `a` is not empty and the first element of `a` is 0. Right before the loop, `a` is a list of integers, but there is no guarantee that it is not empty or that its first element is 0.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of `a` to be non-empty and its first element to be 0.

State: **t is an integer larger than 0, n is an integer, a is a non-empty list of integers with its first element being 0, res is 0, _ is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases**
