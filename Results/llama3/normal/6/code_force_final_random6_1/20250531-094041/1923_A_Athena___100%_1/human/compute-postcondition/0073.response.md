The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Since the last element of `a` was 0, it is removed. The list `a` now has one less element than before.

The values of the other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer larger than 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with no leading zeros and has at least one element, `res` is 0, `i` is undefined, `_` is 2, and `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases**
