Output State: **`t` is an integer larger than 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with `i-2` elements, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `res` is 0, `_` is 1, and `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases.**

The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `a`, which was initially a list of integers with `i-1` elements and the first element was 0. After removing the first element, the list `a` now has `i-2` elements. The length of `a` is still equal to `i`, but `i` is now one less than its original value. The values of the other variables, `t`, `n`, `res`, and `_`, remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-4` test cases.
