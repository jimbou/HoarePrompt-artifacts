Output State: **`t` is an integer larger than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers (with all leading zeros removed) and the last element of a is not 0, `i` is 1, `a` must have at least 2 elements. If the current value of `a[i]` is 0, then `res` is 2 and `_` is 0. Otherwise, the state of `res` and `_` is unchanged. `stdin` contains t-2 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been incremented by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions on `a` and `i` are still valid, and the state of `res` and `_` depends on the value of `a[i]`. The number of test cases in `stdin` remains the same.
