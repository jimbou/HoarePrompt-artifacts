Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers with no leading zeros and no trailing zeros, `t` is an integer larger than 1, `n` is an integer, `res` is 0, `i` is undefined, `_` is 2, and `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == 0:
        res += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is a list of integers with no leading zeros and no trailing zeros that must have at least 1 element, `t` is an integer larger than 1, `n` is an integer, `res` is 1 if the first element of `a` is 0, otherwise `res` is 0, `i` is 0, `_` is 2, and `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is a list of integers with no leading zeros and no trailing zeros that must have at least 2 elements, `t` is an integer larger than 1, `n` is an integer, `i` is 1, `_` is 2, and `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases. If the second element of `a` is 0, `res` is 2 if the first element of `a` is 0, otherwise `res` is 1. Otherwise, the state of `res` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is a list of integers with no leading zeros and no trailing zeros that must have at least 3 elements, `t` is an integer larger than 1, `n` is an integer, `i` is 2, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases. If the second element of `a` is 0, `res` is 3 if the first element of `a` is 0, otherwise `res` is 2. Otherwise, the state of `res` remains unchanged but it is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
