The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `a`. Since the first element of `a` is 0, this element is removed. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains `t-2` test cases.

Output State: **`t` is an integer larger than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with at least one element and the first element of `a` is removed, `res` is 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains `t-2` test cases**
