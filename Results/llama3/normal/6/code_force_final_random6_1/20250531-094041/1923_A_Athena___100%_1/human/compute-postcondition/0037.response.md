Output State: **`t` is an integer larger than 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with `i-3` elements, `i` is greater than the length of `a` minus 1, `res` is 0, `_` is 1, and `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases.**

In this output state, the list `a` has been modified by removing the first element using the `pop(0)` method. The length of `a` is now `i-3` elements, since one element has been removed. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-4` test cases.
