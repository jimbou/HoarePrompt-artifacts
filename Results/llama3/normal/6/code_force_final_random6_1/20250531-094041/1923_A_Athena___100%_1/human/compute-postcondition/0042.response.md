Output State: **`t` is an integer larger than 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with all leading zeros removed and has a length of at least `i-1`, `i` is greater than 1 and equal to the length of `a` minus one, `res` is 0, `_` is 1, and `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases.**

In this output state, the length of list `a` has been reduced by one due to the `pop()` operation, which removes the last element from the list. The value of `i` remains the same, but since the length of `a` has decreased, the relationship between `i` and the length of `a` has changed. The other variables, including `t`, `n`, `res`, and `_`, remain unchanged. The number of test cases in `stdin` also remains the same.
