The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Since `a` is a non-empty list of integers ending with 0, the last element is 0. After removing the last element, the list `a` is still non-empty, but it no longer ends with 0.

The values of the other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer larger than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers (with all leading zeros removed), `res` is 0, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases**
