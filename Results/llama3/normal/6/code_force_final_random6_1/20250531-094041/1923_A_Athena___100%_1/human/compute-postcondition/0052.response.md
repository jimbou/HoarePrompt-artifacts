Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer larger than 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with all trailing zeros removed and must have at least 1 element, `i` is less than the length of `a` and is increased by 1, `_` is 1, and `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases. If the current value of `a[i]` is 0, then `res` is 2. Otherwise, the value of `res` is increased by 1.***
