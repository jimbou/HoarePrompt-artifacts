To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of `a` so that it remains non-empty and its first element is 0.

State: **`t` is an integer larger than 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers and its first two elements are 0, `res` is 0, `i` is undefined, `_` is 2, and `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases**
