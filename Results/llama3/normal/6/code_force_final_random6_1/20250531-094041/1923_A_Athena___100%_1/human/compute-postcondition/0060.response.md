Output State: **t is an integer larger than 1, n is an integer, a is a list of integers, res is 0, i is undefined, _ is 2, and stdin contains t-6 test cases**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `n` is updated to the integer value of the input, replacing its original value. The list `a` is updated to a new list of integers from the input, and its length is not necessarily equal to `i` anymore. The variable `res` is reset to 0. The variable `i` is no longer defined as it is not reassigned a value after the list `a` is updated. The value of `_` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The number of test cases in `stdin` is reduced by 2, as two inputs are consumed by the code.
