Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with no leading zeros and no trailing zeros that must have at least 3 elements, `t` is an integer larger than 1, `n` is an integer, `i` is 2, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases, if the second element of `a` is 0, `res` is 3 if the first element of `a` is 0, otherwise `res` is 2. Otherwise, the state of `res` remains unchanged but it is incremented by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been incremented by 1. If the second element of `a` is 0, the value of `res` is either 3 or 2 depending on the value of the first element of `a`. If the second element of `a` is not 0, the value of `res` remains unchanged but it is incremented by 1. The values of the other variables are not affected.
