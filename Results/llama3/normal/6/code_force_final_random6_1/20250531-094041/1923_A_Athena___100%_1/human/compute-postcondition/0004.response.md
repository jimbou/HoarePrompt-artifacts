Output State: **t is an integer larger than 0, n is an integer, a is a non-empty list of integers with its first element being removed, res is 0, _ is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases**

In this output state, the value of `a` has changed as the first element (which was 0) has been removed from the list. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-2 test cases.
