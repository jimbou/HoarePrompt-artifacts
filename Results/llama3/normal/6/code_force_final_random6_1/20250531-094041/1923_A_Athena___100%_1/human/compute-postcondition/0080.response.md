Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with no leading zeros and no trailing zeros that must have at least 2 elements, `t` is an integer larger than 1, `n` is an integer, `res` is 2 if the first element of `a` is 0, otherwise `res` is 1, `i` is 1, `_` is 2, and `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been incremented by 1. If the first element of `a` is 0, `res` is now 2; otherwise, `res` is now 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
