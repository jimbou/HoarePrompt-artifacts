Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer larger than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers (with all leading zeros removed) and the last element of a is not 0, `i` is 0. If the current value of `a[i]` is 0, then `res` is 1 and `_` is 0. Otherwise, the state of `res` and `_` is unchanged. `stdin` contains t-2 test cases.***
