The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Since the last element of `a` is 0, it is removed. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains `t-2` test cases.

Output State: **`t` is an integer larger than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers (with all leading zeros removed) and the last element of `a` is not 0, `res` is 0, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases**
