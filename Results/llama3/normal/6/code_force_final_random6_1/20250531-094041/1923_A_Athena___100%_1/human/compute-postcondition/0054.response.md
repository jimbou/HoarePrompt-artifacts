Output State: **`t` is an integer larger than 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with all trailing zeros removed and must have at least 1 element, `i` is less than the length of `a`, `_` is 1, `res` is either 3 or increased by 2, and `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been increased by 1, so it is either 3 (if it was initially 2) or increased by 2 (if it was initially increased by 1). The other variables remain unchanged.
