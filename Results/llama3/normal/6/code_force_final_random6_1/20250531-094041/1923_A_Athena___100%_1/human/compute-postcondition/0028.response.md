Based on the initial state, the code `print(res)` will print the value of `res`, which is equal to the number of zeros in the list `a`.

Since `a` is a non-empty list of integers with all leading zeros removed and the last element of `a` is not 0, the number of zeros in `a` is a well-defined integer value.

Output: **the number of zeros in the list a**
