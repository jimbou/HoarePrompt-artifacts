Output State: **t is an integer larger than 0, n is an integer, a is a list of integers, res is 0, _ is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases**

In this final state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `n` is now an integer, which was assigned from the input. The list `a` contains a list of integers, which were also assigned from the input. The variable `res` is initialized to 0. The value of `_` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 2, as two inputs were read from stdin.
