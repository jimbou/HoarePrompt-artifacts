Output State: **`t` is an integer larger than 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with `i-1` elements, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `res` is 0, `_` is 1, and `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases.**

The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `a`, which was initially 0. This changes the length of `a` to `i-1`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-4` test cases.
