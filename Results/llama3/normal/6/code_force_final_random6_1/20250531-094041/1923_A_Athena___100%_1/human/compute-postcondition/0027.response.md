Output State: **`t` is an integer larger than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers (with all leading zeros removed) and the last element of a is not 0, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `res` is equal to the number of zeros in `a`, and `_` is 0. `stdin` contains t-2 test cases.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for `t`, `n`, and `a` as in the initial state. The variable `i` will be equal to the length of the list `a`, indicating that the loop has iterated over all elements of `a`. The variable `res` will be equal to the number of zeros in the list `a`, because the loop increments `res` by 1 each time it encounters a zero in `a`. The variable `_` remains unchanged at 0. The state of `stdin` also remains unchanged, containing `t-2` test cases.
