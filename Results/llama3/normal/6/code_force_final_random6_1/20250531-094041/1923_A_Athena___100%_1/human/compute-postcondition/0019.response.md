Output State: **`t` is an integer larger than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers (with all leading zeros removed) and the last element of a is not 0, `res` is 1, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains t-2 test cases, `i` is 0. The current value of `a[i]` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The list `a` still has the same elements, and the current value of `a[i]` is still 0. The number of test cases in `stdin` is still `t-2`.
