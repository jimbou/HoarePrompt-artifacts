Output State: **`t` is an integer larger than 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two lines: the first line contains one integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) where a_i = 0 means the i-th cell is free and a_i = 1 means the i-th cell contains a chip. In each test case, at least one cell contains a chip.**

In natural language, the output state is: The variable `t` now holds the number of test cases, which is an integer larger than 0. The stdin now contains `t-1` test cases, each with two lines: the first line contains an integer `n` between 2 and 50 (inclusive), and the second line contains `n` integers between 0 and 1 (inclusive), where 0 represents a free cell and 1 represents a cell with a chip. In each test case, at least one cell contains a chip.
