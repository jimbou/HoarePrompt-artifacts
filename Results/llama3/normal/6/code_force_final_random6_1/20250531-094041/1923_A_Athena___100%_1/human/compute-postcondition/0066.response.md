Output State: **`t` is an integer larger than 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `res` is 0, `i` is undefined, `_` is 2, and `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases, the first element of `a` has been removed.**

In this output state, the first element of the list `a` has been removed using the `pop(0)` method, which removes the element at index 0. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` now has at least one element, since it had at least two elements initially and one has been removed.
