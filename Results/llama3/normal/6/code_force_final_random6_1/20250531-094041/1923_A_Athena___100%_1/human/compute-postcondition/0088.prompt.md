Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer larger than 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two lines: the first line contains one integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) where a_i = 0 means the i-th cell is free and a_i = 1 means the i-th cell contains a chip. In each test case, at least one cell contains a chip.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    res = 0
    while a and a[0] == 0:
        a.pop(0)
    while a and a[-1] == 0:
        a.pop()
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] == 0:
            res += 1
    print(res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer larger than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers (with all leading zeros removed) and the last element of a is not 0, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `res` is equal to the number of zeros in `a`, and `_` is 0. `stdin` contains t-2 test cases, and the number of zeros in the list `a` which is `res` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer larger than 1, n is an integer, a is a list of integers with all trailing zeros removed, i is equal to the length of a, res is equal to the number of zeros in a, _ is 1, and stdin contains t-4 test cases, and the number of zeros in list a which is res is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of integers with no leading zeros and no trailing zeros, `t` is an integer larger than 1, `n` is an integer, `res` is the number of zeros in the list `a`, `i` is the last index of the list `a`, `_` is 2, and `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases, and the number of zeros in the list `a` which is `res` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
