This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the number of zeros in each test case after removing leading and trailing zeros. It takes no arguments and returns no value, only printing the results to the console. The function modifies the input list by removing leading and trailing zeros and counts the remaining zeros. After execution, the input list is empty, and the input stream is exhausted.
