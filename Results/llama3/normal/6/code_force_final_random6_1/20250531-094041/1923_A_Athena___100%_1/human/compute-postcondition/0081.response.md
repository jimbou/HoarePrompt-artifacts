Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers with no leading zeros and no trailing zeros that must have at least 2 elements, `t` is an integer larger than 1, `n` is an integer, `i` is 1, `_` is 2, and `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases. If the second element of `a` is 0, `res` is 2 if the first element of `a` is 0, otherwise `res` is 1. Otherwise, the state of `res` remains unchanged.***
