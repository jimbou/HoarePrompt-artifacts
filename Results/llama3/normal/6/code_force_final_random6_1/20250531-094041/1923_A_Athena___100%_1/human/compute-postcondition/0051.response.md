Output State: **`t` is an integer larger than 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with all trailing zeros removed and must have at least 1 element, `i` is less than the length of `a` and is increased by 1, `_` is 1, `res` is increased by 1, and `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases. If the current value of `a[i]` is 0, then `res` is 2. Otherwise, the value of `res` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `res` is increased by 1, regardless of the current value of `a[i]`. If `a[i]` is 0, then `res` becomes 2, otherwise, it is increased by 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-4` test cases.
