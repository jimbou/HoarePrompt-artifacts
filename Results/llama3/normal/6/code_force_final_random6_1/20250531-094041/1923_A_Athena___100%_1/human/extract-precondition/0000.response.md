Precondition: **stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains two lines: the first line contains one integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) where a_i = 0 means the i-th cell is free and a_i = 1 means the i-th cell contains a chip. In each test case, at least one cell contains a chip.**
