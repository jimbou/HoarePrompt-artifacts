Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when the array has only two distinct elements, and they are alternating. In this case, the program will return the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of either element, which is not the correct answer. The correct answer should be 1, because removing any one element will make the array not beautiful.

For example, for the input [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2], the program will return 2, but the correct answer is 1.
