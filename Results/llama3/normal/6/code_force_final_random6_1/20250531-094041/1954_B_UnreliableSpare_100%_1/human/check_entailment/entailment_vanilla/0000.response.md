Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful. The program first checks if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it prints -1, indicating that it is impossible to make the array stop being beautiful by removing elements.

If the array contains different elements, the program then iterates through the array to find the minimum count of consecutive elements that have the same value. This is done by maintaining a counter `cnt` that increments when the current element is the same as the previous one, and resets when a different element is encountered. The minimum count is updated whenever a different element is encountered.

Finally, the program prints the minimum count, which represents the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful.

The program correctly handles the edge case where all elements in the array are the same, and it correctly calculates the minimum count of consecutive elements that have the same value.

Correctness: **True**
