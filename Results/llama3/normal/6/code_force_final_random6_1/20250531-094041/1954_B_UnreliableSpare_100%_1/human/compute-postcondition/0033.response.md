The code prints the value of `ans`, which is the minimum of its original value and the number of consecutive elements in `arr` that are equal to the first element of `arr`, denoted by `val`. Since `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its original value and `cnt`, which is the number of consecutive elements in `arr` that are equal to the first element of `arr`, the printed value will be the minimum number of consecutive elements in `arr` that are equal to the first element of `arr`.

Output: **the minimum number of consecutive elements in `arr` that are equal to the first element of `arr`**
