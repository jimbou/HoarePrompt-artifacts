Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, arr is a list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, i is 1, flag is False if there exists at least one pair of adjacent elements in arr that are not equal, otherwise flag is True, ans is the minimum of its original value and the number of consecutive elements in arr that are equal to the first element of arr, val is the first element of arr, cnt is 0.**

In this final state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the minimum of its original value and the number of consecutive elements in `arr` that are equal to the first element of `arr`. The value of `cnt` has been reset to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
