Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, arr is a list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, i is n, flag is False if there exists at least one pair of adjacent elements in arr that are not equal, otherwise flag is True, ans is Infinity, val is the first element of arr, cnt is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if arr[i] == val:
        cnt += 1
    else:
        ans = min(ans, cnt)
        cnt = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, arr is a list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, i is 0, flag is False if there exists at least one pair of adjacent elements in arr that are not equal, otherwise flag is True, ans is the minimum of its original value and the number of consecutive elements in arr that are equal to the first element of arr, val is the first element of arr, cnt is the number of consecutive elements in arr that are equal to the first element of arr. If the current element of arr at index i is equal to val, cnt is incremented by 1. Otherwise, ans is updated to be the minimum of its original value and 0, and cnt is reset to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, arr is a list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, i is 1, flag is False if there exists at least one pair of adjacent elements in arr that are not equal, otherwise flag is True, val is the first element of arr. If arr[i] is equal to val, then ans is the minimum of its original value and cnt + 1, and cnt is the number of consecutive elements in arr that are equal to the first element of arr plus one. Otherwise, ans is the minimum of its original value and the number of consecutive elements in arr that are equal to the first element of arr, and cnt is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer between 2 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, arr is a list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, i is 2, flag is False if there exists at least one pair of adjacent elements in arr that are not equal, otherwise flag is True, val is the first element of arr. If arr[i] is equal to val, then ans is the minimum of its original value and cnt + 1, and cnt is the number of consecutive elements in arr that are equal to the first element of arr plus two if arr[i] is equal to val, otherwise cnt is 1. Otherwise, ans is the minimum of its original value and the number of consecutive elements in arr that are equal to the first element of arr, and cnt is 0 if arr[i] is not equal to val.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
