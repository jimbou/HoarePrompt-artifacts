Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n` inclusive, stdin contains `t - 1` test cases, `i` is 0, `flag` is False if there exists at least one pair of adjacent elements in `arr` that are not equal, otherwise `flag` is True, `ans` is Infinity, `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is 1. The current value of `arr[i]` is equal to `val`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged, including `n`, `arr`, `stdin`, `i`, `flag`, `ans`, and `val`. The condition that `arr[i]` is equal to `val` still holds true.
