Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, arr is a list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, flag is True, stdin contains t - 1 test cases**.

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`, which is between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive. The second line assigns a list of `n` integers from the input to `arr`, where each integer is between 1 and `n` inclusive. The third line sets `flag` to `True`. Since `flag` is not modified by the code, its value remains `True`. The value of `t` is not modified by the code, so it remains the same. The stdin now contains `t - 1` test cases, as one test case has been processed.
