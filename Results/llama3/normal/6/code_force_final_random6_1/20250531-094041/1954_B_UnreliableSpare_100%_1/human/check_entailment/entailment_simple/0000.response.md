Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful. A beautiful array is one where all elements can be made the same by replacing an element with its adjacent elements if they are the same.

The program first checks if all adjacent elements in the array are equal. If they are, it prints -1, indicating that it is impossible to make the array stop being beautiful by removing elements.

If not all adjacent elements are equal, the program then finds the minimum number of consecutive elements that are equal to the first element of the array. This is done by iterating through the array and keeping track of the count of consecutive equal elements. The minimum count is updated whenever a new sequence of equal elements is found.

The program then prints the minimum count, which represents the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
