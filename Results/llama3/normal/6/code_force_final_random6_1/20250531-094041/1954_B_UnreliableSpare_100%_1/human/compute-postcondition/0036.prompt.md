You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5) followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n) such that the list is beautiful.
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
        
    #State: n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, arr is a list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, i is n, flag is False if there exists at least one pair of adjacent elements in arr that are not equal, otherwise flag is True.
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    val, cnt = arr[0], 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
            cnt = 0
        
    #State: n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, arr is a list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, i is n, flag is False if there exists at least one pair of adjacent elements in arr that are not equal, otherwise flag is True, ans is the minimum of its original value and the number of consecutive elements in arr that are equal to the first element of arr, val is the first element of arr, cnt is the number of consecutive elements in arr that are equal to the first element of arr.
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
    else :
        print(ans)
        #This is printed: the minimum number of consecutive elements in `arr` that are equal to the first element of `arr`
    #State: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n` inclusive, stdin contains `t - 1` test cases, `i` is `n`, `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements in `arr` that are equal to the first element of `arr`. If all adjacent elements in `arr` are equal, then `flag` is `True`, `ans` is the minimum of its original value and `n`, and -1 is printed. Otherwise, `flag` is `False`, `ans` is the minimum of its original value and the number of consecutive elements in `arr` that are equal to the first element of `arr`, and this minimum value is printed.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n` inclusive, stdin contains `t - 1` test cases, `i` is `n`, `flag` is `True` indicating that all adjacent elements in `arr` are equal, `ans` is the minimum of its original value and the number of consecutive elements in `arr` that are equal to the first element of `arr`, `val` is the first element of `arr`, and `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements in `arr` that are equal to the first element of `arr`, which is equal to `n` since all elements in `arr` are equal, and -1 is printed

Case_2: `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n` inclusive, stdin contains `t - 1` test cases, `i` is `n`, `flag` is `False`, `ans` is the minimum of its original value and the number of consecutive elements in `arr` that are equal to the first element of `arr`, `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements in `arr` that are equal to the first element of `arr`. There exists at least one pair of adjacent elements in `arr` that are not equal, and the minimum of its original value and the number of consecutive elements in `arr` that are equal to the first element of `arr` is being printed


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
