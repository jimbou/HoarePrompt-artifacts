Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n` inclusive, stdin contains `t - 1` test cases, `i` is `n`, `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements in `arr` that are equal to the first element of `arr`. If all adjacent elements in `arr` are equal, then `flag` is `True`, `ans` is the minimum of its original value and `n`, and -1 is printed. Otherwise, `flag` is `False`, `ans` is the minimum of its original value and the number of consecutive elements in `arr` that are equal to the first element of `arr`, and this minimum value is printed.***
