Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, arr is a list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, i is 2, flag is False if there exists at least one pair of adjacent elements in arr that are not equal, otherwise flag is True, val is the first element of arr, ans is the minimum of its original value and cnt, cnt is 0.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the minimum value between `ans` and `cnt` to `ans`. Since `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements in `arr` that are equal to the first element of `arr` plus one, and `ans` is the minimum of its original value and `cnt + 1` if `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, or the minimum of its original value and the number of consecutive elements in `arr` that are equal to the first element of `arr` if `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`, the value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its original value and `cnt`. The second line resets `cnt` to 0.
