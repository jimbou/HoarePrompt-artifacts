Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, arr is a list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, i is n, flag is False if there exists at least one pair of adjacent elements in arr that are not equal, otherwise flag is True, ans is the minimum of its original value and the number of consecutive elements in arr that are equal to the first element of arr, val is the first element of arr, cnt is the number of consecutive elements in arr that are equal to the first element of arr.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

*   The value of `n` remains unchanged, still an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive.
*   The list `arr` remains unchanged, still containing `n` integers between 1 and `n` inclusive.
*   The value of `stdin` remains unchanged, still containing `t - 1` test cases.
*   The value of `i` is now `n`, indicating that the loop has executed `n` times.
*   The value of `flag` remains unchanged, still `False` if there exists at least one pair of adjacent elements in `arr` that are not equal, otherwise `True`.
*   The value of `ans` is now the minimum of its original value and the number of consecutive elements in `arr` that are equal to the first element of `arr`.
*   The value of `val` remains unchanged, still the first element of `arr`.
*   The value of `cnt` is now the number of consecutive elements in `arr` that are equal to the first element of `arr`.
