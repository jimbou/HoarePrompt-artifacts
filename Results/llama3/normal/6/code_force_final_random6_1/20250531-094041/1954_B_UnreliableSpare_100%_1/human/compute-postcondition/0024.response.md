Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, arr is a list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, i is 2, flag is False if there exists at least one pair of adjacent elements in arr that are not equal, otherwise flag is True, val is the first element of arr. If arr[i] is equal to val, then ans is the minimum of its original value and cnt + 1, and cnt is the number of consecutive elements in arr that are equal to the first element of arr plus two. Otherwise, ans is the minimum of its original value and the number of consecutive elements in arr that are equal to the first element of arr, and cnt is 1.**

In this output state, the value of cnt has been incremented by 1. If arr[i] is equal to val, then cnt is now the number of consecutive elements in arr that are equal to the first element of arr plus two. Otherwise, cnt is now 1. The values of the other variables remain the same.
