Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n` inclusive, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `i` is 1. If the current value of `arr[i]` is not equal to the current value of `arr[i - 1]`, then `flag` is set to False. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
