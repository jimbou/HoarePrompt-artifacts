Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n` inclusive, stdin contains `t - 1` test cases, `i` is 1, `flag` is False if there exists at least one pair of adjacent elements in `arr` that are not equal, otherwise `flag` is True, `ans` is the minimum of its original value and `cnt + 1`, `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements in `arr` that are equal to the first element of `arr` plus one.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `ans` has been updated to be the minimum of its original value and the new value of `cnt`. The other variables remain unchanged.
