This function reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers from standard input, then determines the minimum number of consecutive elements in the list that are equal to the first element. If all adjacent elements in the list are equal, it prints -1; otherwise, it prints the minimum number of consecutive elements equal to the first element.
