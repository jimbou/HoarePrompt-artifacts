Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `b` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t` is an integer equal to twice the value of `b` divided by 5 if twice the value of `b` is divisible by 5, otherwise `t` is an integer equal to twice the value of `b` divided by 5 plus 1, and `t1` is an integer equal to 15 times `t` minus 4 times `b`. If `t1` is less than `a`, then if `t2` is divisible by 15, `t` is an integer equal to twice the value of `b` divided by 5 if twice the value of `b` is divisible by 5, otherwise `t` is an integer equal to twice the value of `b` divided by 5 plus 1 plus `t2` divided by 15, and `t1` is an integer equal to 15 times `t` minus 4 times `b`, and `t2` is an integer equal to `a` minus 15 times `t` plus 4 times `b`. If `t2` is not divisible by 15, then `t` is an integer equal to `t1` divided by 15 plus 1, and `t1` is an integer equal to 15 times `t` minus 4 times `b`, and `t2` is an integer equal to `a` minus 15 times `t` plus 4 times `b`, and the value of `t` is being printed**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `n` will be greater than or equal to 0, and the value of `i` will be equal to `n`. The values of `a` and `b` will be equal to the first and second integers from the input, respectively. The value of `t` will be calculated based on the values of `a` and `b`, and will be either twice the value of `b` divided by 5 if twice the value of `b` is divisible by 5, or twice the value of `b` divided by 5 plus 1 if twice the value of `b` is not divisible by 5. The value of `t1` will be equal to 15 times `t` minus 4 times `b`, and the value of `t2` will be equal to `a` minus 15 times `t` plus 4 times `b`. If `t2` is divisible by 15, then `t` will be updated to `t` plus `t2` divided by 15. If `t2` is not divisible by 15, then `t` will be updated to `t` plus `t2` divided by 15 plus 1. The value of `t` will be printed after each iteration of the loop.
