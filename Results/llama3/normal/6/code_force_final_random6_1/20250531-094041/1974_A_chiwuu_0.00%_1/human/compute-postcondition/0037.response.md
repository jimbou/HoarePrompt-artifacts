Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `b` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `t` is an integer equal to twice the value of `b` divided by 5.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been updated to be twice the value of `b` divided by 5, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The value of `t` is now an integer that is the result of the floor division of twice the value of `b` by 5.
