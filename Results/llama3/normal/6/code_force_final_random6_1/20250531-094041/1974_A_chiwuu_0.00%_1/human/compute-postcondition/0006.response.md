Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. `t = t // 5 + 1`:
	* `t` is assigned a new value, which is the result of the expression `t // 5 + 1`.
	* Since `t` is initially 2 times the value of `b`, we can substitute `t` with `2b` in the expression.
	* The expression becomes `2b // 5 + 1`.
	* Since `t` is not divisible by 5, `2b` is also not divisible by 5.
	* The `//` operator performs integer division, which discards the remainder. Therefore, `2b // 5` will be an integer.
	* Adding 1 to the result of the integer division will give us a new integer value.

Now, let's update the values of the variables:

* `n` is still greater than 0.
* `i` is still 0.
* `a` is still an integer.
* `b` is still an integer.
* `t` is now `2b // 5 + 1`, which is an integer.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t` is `2b // 5 + 1`, which is an integer.**

Note that we didn't include the information about `t` not being divisible by 5 in the output state, as it is no longer relevant after the assignment.
