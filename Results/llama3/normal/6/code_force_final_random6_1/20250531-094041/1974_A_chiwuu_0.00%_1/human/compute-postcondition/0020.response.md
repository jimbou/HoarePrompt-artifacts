Output: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t` is equal to `t`, `t1` is either 2 times the value of `b` divided by 5 multiplied by 15 minus `b` multiplied by 4, if `t` is a multiple of 5, or 2b // 5 + 1 multiplied by 15 minus `b` multiplied by 4, if `t` is not a multiple of 5. Otherwise, `t1` is less than `a`, `t2` is equal to `a` minus `t1`. If `t2` is a multiple of 15, then `t` is equal to `t` plus `t2` divided by 15. Otherwise, `t` is equal to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`, and the value of `t` is being printed**
