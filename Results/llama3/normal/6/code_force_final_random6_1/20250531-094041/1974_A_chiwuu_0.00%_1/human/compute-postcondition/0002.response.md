Output State: **n is greater than 0, i is 0, a is an integer, b is an integer, t is 2 times the value of b**

The code block first reads two values from the input and assigns them to `a` and `b`, converting them to integers. The third line calculates `t` as twice the value of `b`. The initial values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code.
