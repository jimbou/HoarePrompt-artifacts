Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `b` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `t` is an integer equal to twice the value of `b` divided by 5 if twice the value of `b` is divisible by 5, otherwise `t` is an integer equal to twice the value of `b` divided by 5 plus 1 plus `t2` divided by 15, `t1` is an integer equal to 15 times `t` minus 4 times `b`, `t2` is an integer equal to `a` minus 15 times `t` plus 4 times `b`.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been updated to include the additional value of `t2` divided by 15. The other variables remain unchanged.
