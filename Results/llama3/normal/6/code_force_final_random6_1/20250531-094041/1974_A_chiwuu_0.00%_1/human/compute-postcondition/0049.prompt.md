Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains n lines, each containing two integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a, b = input().split()
    a = int(a)
    b = int(b)
    t = b * 2
    if t % 5 == 0:
        t = t // 5
    else:
        t = t // 5 + 1
    t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
    if t1 >= a:
        t = t
    else:
        t2 = a - t1
        if t2 % 15 == 0:
            t = t + t2 // 15
        else:
            t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
    print(t)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t` is equal to `t`, `t1` is either 2 times the value of `b` divided by 5 multiplied by 15 minus `b` multiplied by 4, if `t` is a multiple of 5, or 2b // 5 + 1 multiplied by 15 minus `b` multiplied by 4, if `t` is not a multiple of 5. Otherwise, `t1` is less than `a`, `t2` is equal to `a` minus `t1`. If `t2` is a multiple of 15, then `t` is equal to `t` plus `t2` divided by 15. Otherwise, `t` is equal to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`, and the value of `t` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `b` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `t` is an integer equal to twice the value of `b` divided by 5 if twice the value of `b` is divisible by 5, otherwise `t` is an integer equal to twice the value of `b` divided by 5 plus 1. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t1` is an integer equal to 15 times `t` minus 4 times `b`. Otherwise, if `t2` is divisible by 15, then `t` is updated to `t` plus `a` minus 15 times `t` minus 4 times `b` divided by 15. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t1` divided by 15 plus 1 plus `t`, and the value of `t` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `b` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t` is an integer equal to twice the value of `b` divided by 5 if twice the value of `b` is divisible by 5, otherwise `t` is an integer equal to twice the value of `b` divided by 5 plus 1, and `t1` is an integer equal to 15 times `t` minus 4 times `b`. If `t1` is less than `a`, then if `t2` is divisible by 15, `t` is an integer equal to twice the value of `b` divided by 5 if twice the value of `b` is divisible by 5, otherwise `t` is an integer equal to twice the value of `b` divided by 5 plus 1 plus `t2` divided by 15, and `t1` is an integer equal to 15 times `t` minus 4 times `b`, and `t2` is an integer equal to `a` minus 15 times `t` plus 4 times `b`. If `t2` is not divisible by 15, then `t` is an integer equal to `t1` divided by 15 plus 1, and `t1` is an integer equal to 15 times `t` minus 4 times `b`, and `t2` is an integer equal to `a` minus 15 times `t` plus 4 times `b`, and the value of `t` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
