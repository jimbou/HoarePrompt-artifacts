Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `b` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `t` is an integer equal to twice the value of `b` divided by 5 plus 1.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The value of `t` is updated to be twice the value of `b` divided by 5 plus 1. This means that `t` is now equal to `(2 * b) // 5 + 1`.
