Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `b` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `t` is an integer equal to twice the value of `b` divided by 5**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been updated to be twice the value of `b` divided by 5, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The value of `t` is now an integer result of the division operation, which means any fractional part has been truncated.
