Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t1` is an integer. If `t` is a multiple of 5, then `t1` is 2 times the value of `b` divided by 5 multiplied by 15 minus `b` multiplied by 4, which is equivalent to `t1` being equal to 2(b // 5) * 15 - b * 4. Otherwise, `t1` is 2b // 5 + 1 multiplied by 15 minus `b` multiplied by 4, which is equivalent to `t1` being equal to (2b // 5 + 1) * 15 - b * 4. Additionally, `t1` is less than `a`.***
