Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t1` is an integer, `t2` is a multiple of 15, `t` is either a multiple of 5 or not a multiple of 5, if `t` is a multiple of 5, then `t1` is 2(b // 5) * 15 - b * 4, otherwise `t1` is (2b // 5 + 1) * 15 - b * 4, `t1` is less than `a`, `t2` is equal to `a` minus `t1`, `t` is equal to `t` plus `t2` divided by 15.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still greater than 0, `i` is still 0, `a` and `b` are still integers. The value of `t1` is still dependent on whether `t` is a multiple of 5 or not, and it is still less than `a`. The value of `t2` is still a multiple of 15 and is equal to `a` minus `t1`. The value of `t` has been updated to be the sum of its original value and `t2` divided by 15.
