Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t1` is an integer. If t is a multiple of 5, then `t1` is 2 times the value of `b` divided by 5 multiplied by 15 minus `b` multiplied by 4, which is equivalent to `t1` being equal to 2(b // 5) * 15 - b * 4. Otherwise, `t1` is 2b // 5 + 1 multiplied by 15 minus `b` multiplied by 4, which is equivalent to `t1` being equal to (2b // 5 + 1) * 15 - b * 4.**

In natural language, the output state is: `n` is still greater than 0, `i` is still 0, `a` and `b` are still integers. A new variable `t1` is introduced, which is an integer. The value of `t1` depends on whether `t` is a multiple of 5 or not. If `t` is a multiple of 5, then `t1` is calculated as 2 times the value of `b` divided by 5 multiplied by 15 minus `b` multiplied by 4. Otherwise, `t1` is calculated as 2b // 5 + 1 multiplied by 15 minus `b` multiplied by 4.
