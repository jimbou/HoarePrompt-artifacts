Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `b` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `t` is an integer equal to twice the value of `b` divided by 5 if twice the value of `b` is divisible by 5, otherwise `t` is an integer equal to twice the value of `b` divided by 5 plus 1, `t1` is an integer equal to 15 times `t` minus 4 times `b`, `t2` is an integer equal to `a` minus `t1`**.

In natural language, the output state is: `n` is still greater than 1, `i` is still 1, `a` and `b` are still equal to the first and second integers from the input respectively. `t` is still dependent on the value of `b`. `t1` is still dependent on the values of `t` and `b`. A new variable `t2` is introduced, which is equal to `a` minus `t1`.
