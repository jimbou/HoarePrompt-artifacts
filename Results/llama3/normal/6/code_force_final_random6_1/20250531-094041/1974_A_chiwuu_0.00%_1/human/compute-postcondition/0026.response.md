Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `b` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `t` is an integer equal to twice the value of `b` divided by 5 if twice the value of `b` is divisible by 5, otherwise `t` is an integer equal to twice the value of `b` divided by 5 plus 1, `t1` is an integer equal to 15 times `t` minus 4 times `b`.**

In this output state, the value of `t1` is calculated based on the value of `t`, which depends on whether twice the value of `b` is divisible by 5. If it is, `t` is twice the value of `b` divided by 5, and if not, `t` is twice the value of `b` divided by 5 plus 1. The value of `t1` is then calculated as 15 times `t` minus 4 times `b`. The values of `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
