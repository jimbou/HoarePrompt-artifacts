Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `b` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `t` is an integer equal to `t1` divided by 15 plus 1, `t1` is an integer equal to 15 times `t` minus 4 times `b`, `t2` is an integer equal to `a` minus 15 times `t` plus 4 times `b`.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been updated to be equal to `t1` divided by 15 plus 1. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The expression for `t1` and `t2` remains the same, but the value of `t` has been updated, which may affect the values of `t1` and `t2` if they are recalculated.
