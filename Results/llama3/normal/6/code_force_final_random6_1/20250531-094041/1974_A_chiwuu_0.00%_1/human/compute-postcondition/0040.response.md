Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `b` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `t` is an integer equal to twice the value of `b` divided by 5 if twice the value of `b` is divisible by 5, otherwise `t` is an integer equal to twice the value of `b` divided by 5 plus 1, `t1` is an integer equal to 15 times `t` minus 4 times `b`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The value of `t` is still dependent on whether twice the value of `b` is divisible by 5. A new variable `t1` is introduced, which is calculated as 15 times the value of `t` minus 4 times the value of `b`.
