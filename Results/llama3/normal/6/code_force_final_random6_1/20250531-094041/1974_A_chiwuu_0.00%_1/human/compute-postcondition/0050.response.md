Functionality: **This function reads a series of pairs of integers from standard input, calculates a value based on the second integer of each pair, and prints the calculated value. The calculation involves dividing the second integer by 5, rounding up if necessary, and then adjusting the result based on the first integer of the pair. The function repeats this process for each pair of integers in the input, printing the calculated value for each pair.**
