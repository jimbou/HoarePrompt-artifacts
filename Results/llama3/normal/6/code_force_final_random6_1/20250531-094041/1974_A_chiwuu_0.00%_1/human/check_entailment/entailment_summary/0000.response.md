Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of screens needed to place application icons on a desktop. The desktop consists of screens with a size of 5x3 cells, and there are two types of application icons: 1x1 and 2x2.

The program reads a series of pairs of integers from standard input, where each pair represents the number of 1x1 icons (a) and the number of 2x2 icons (b). It then calculates the minimum number of screens needed to place these icons.

The calculation involves the following steps:

1. Calculate the number of screens needed to place the 2x2 icons (t). This is done by multiplying the number of 2x2 icons by 2, dividing by 5, and rounding up if necessary.
2. Calculate the remaining space on the screens allocated for the 2x2 icons (t1). This is done by multiplying the number of screens allocated for the 2x2 icons by 15 and subtracting the total space occupied by the 2x2 icons (4 times the number of 2x2 icons).
3. If the remaining space is sufficient to place the 1x1 icons, the program prints the number of screens allocated for the 2x2 icons (t). Otherwise, it calculates the additional screens needed to place the 1x1 icons (t2) and adds this to the number of screens allocated for the 2x2 icons.

The program repeats this process for each pair of integers in the input, printing the calculated minimum number of screens needed for each pair.

Based on the provided execution summary, the program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum number of screens needed to place the application icons. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
