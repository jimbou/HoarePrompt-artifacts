Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `b` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input. If `t2` is divisible by 15, then `t` is an integer equal to twice the value of `b` divided by 5 if twice the value of `b` is divisible by 5, otherwise `t` is an integer equal to twice the value of `b` divided by 5 plus 1 plus `t2` divided by 15, and `t1` is an integer equal to 15 times `t` minus 4 times `b`, and `t2` is an integer equal to `a` minus 15 times `t` plus 4 times `b`. If `t2` is not divisible by 15, then `t` is an integer equal to `t1` divided by 15 plus 1, and `t1` is an integer equal to 15 times `t` minus 4 times `b`, and `t2` is an integer equal to `a` minus 15 times `t` plus 4 times `b`.**
