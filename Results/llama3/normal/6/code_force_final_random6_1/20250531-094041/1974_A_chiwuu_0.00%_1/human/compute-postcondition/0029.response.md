Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `b` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `t` is an integer equal to twice the value of `b` divided by 5 if twice the value of `b` is divisible by 5, otherwise `t` is an integer equal to twice the value of `b` divided by 5 plus 1, plus `a` minus 15 times `t` minus 4 times `b` divided by 15, `t1` is an integer equal to 15 times `t` minus 4 times `b`, `t2` is an integer equal to `a` minus `t1`.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been updated by adding the result of the expression `t2 // 15` to its previous value. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
