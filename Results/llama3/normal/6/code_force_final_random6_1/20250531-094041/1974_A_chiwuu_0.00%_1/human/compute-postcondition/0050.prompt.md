You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing two integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99).
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = input().split()
        
        a = int(a)
        
        b = int(b)
        
        t = b * 2
        
        if t % 5 == 0:
            t = t // 5
        else:
            t = t // 5 + 1
        
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        
        print(t)
        
    #State: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `b` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t` is an integer equal to twice the value of `b` divided by 5 if twice the value of `b` is divisible by 5, otherwise `t` is an integer equal to twice the value of `b` divided by 5 plus 1, and `t1` is an integer equal to 15 times `t` minus 4 times `b`. If `t1` is less than `a`, then if `t2` is divisible by 15, `t` is an integer equal to twice the value of `b` divided by 5 if twice the value of `b` is divisible by 5, otherwise `t` is an integer equal to twice the value of `b` divided by 5 plus 1 plus `t2` divided by 15, and `t1` is an integer equal to 15 times `t` minus 4 times `b`, and `t2` is an integer equal to `a` minus 15 times `t` plus 4 times `b`. If `t2` is not divisible by 15, then `t` is an integer equal to `t1` divided by 15 plus 1, and `t1` is an integer equal to 15 times `t` minus 4 times `b`, and `t2` is an integer equal to `a` minus 15 times `t` plus 4 times `b`, and the value of `t` is being printed

Return Postconditions: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `b` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t` is an integer equal to twice the value of `b` divided by 5 if twice the value of `b` is divisible by 5, otherwise `t` is an integer equal to twice the value of `b` divided by 5 plus 1, and `t1` is an integer equal to 15 times `t` minus 4 times `b`. If `t1` is less than `a`, then if `t2` is divisible by 15, `t` is an integer equal to twice the value of `b` divided by 5 if twice the value of `b` is divisible by 5, otherwise `t` is an integer equal to twice the value of `b` divided by 5 plus 1 plus `t2` divided by 15, and `t1` is an integer equal to 15 times `t` minus 4 times `b`, and `t2` is an integer equal to `a` minus 15 times `t` plus 4 times `b`. If `t2` is not divisible by 15, then `t` is an integer equal to `t1` divided by 15 plus 1, and `t1` is an integer equal to 15 times `t` minus 4 times `b`, and `t2` is an integer equal to `a` minus 15 times `t` plus 4 times `b`, and the value of `t` is being printed


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
