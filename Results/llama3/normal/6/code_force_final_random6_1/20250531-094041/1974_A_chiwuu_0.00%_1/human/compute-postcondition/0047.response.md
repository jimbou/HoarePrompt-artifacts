Output: **t (where t is an integer equal to twice the value of b divided by 5 if twice the value of b is divisible by 5, otherwise t is an integer equal to twice the value of b divided by 5 plus 1, if t1 is greater than or equal to a, otherwise t is an integer equal to twice the value of b divided by 5 if twice the value of b is divisible by 5, otherwise t is an integer equal to twice the value of b divided by 5 plus 1 plus t2 divided by 15, if t2 is divisible by 15, otherwise t is an integer equal to t1 divided by 15 plus 1, if t2 is not divisible by 15)**
