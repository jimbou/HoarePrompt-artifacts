Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `b` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `t` is an integer equal to twice the value of `b` divided by 5 if twice the value of `b` is divisible by 5, otherwise `t` is an integer equal to twice the value of `b` divided by 5 plus 1. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t1` is an integer equal to 15 times `t` minus 4 times `b`. Otherwise, if `t2` is divisible by 15, then `t` is updated to `t` plus `a` minus 15 times `t` minus 4 times `b` divided by 15. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t1` divided by 15 plus 1 plus `t`.**
