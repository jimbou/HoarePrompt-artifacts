Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of screens needed to place application icons on a desktop. The desktop is represented as a grid of size 5x3, and there are two types of icons: 1x1 and 2x2.

The program first reads the number of test cases (n) and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of 1x1 icons (a) and the number of 2x2 icons (b).

The program then calculates the number of screens needed to place the 2x2 icons. It does this by multiplying the number of 2x2 icons by 2 (since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells), and then dividing the result by 5 (since each screen has 5 rows). If the result is not an integer, it adds 1 to the result to round up to the nearest whole number.

The program then calculates the remaining space on the screens occupied by the 2x2 icons. It does this by multiplying the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons by 15 (since each screen has 15 cells), and then subtracting the number of cells occupied by the 2x2 icons (which is 4 times the number of 2x2 icons).

If the remaining space is greater than or equal to the number of 1x1 icons, the program sets the total number of screens needed to the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons.

Otherwise, the program calculates the additional number of screens needed to place the remaining 1x1 icons. It does this by subtracting the remaining space from the number of 1x1 icons, and then dividing the result by 15 (since each screen has 15 cells). If the result is not an integer, it adds 1 to the result to round up to the nearest whole number. The program then adds this additional number of screens to the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons.

Finally, the program prints the total number of screens needed.

Correctness: **True**
