Output: **t (where t is either t1 if t1 is greater than or equal to a, or t + t2 divided by 15 if t2 is a multiple of 15, or t + t2 // 15 + 1 otherwise, and t1 is either 2 times the value of b divided by 5 multiplied by 15 minus b multiplied by 4 if t is a multiple of 5, or 2b // 5 + 1 multiplied by 15 minus b multiplied by 4 if t is not a multiple of 5, and t2 is equal to a minus t1)**
