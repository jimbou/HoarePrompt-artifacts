Postcondition: ***n is greater than 2, i is 2, a is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, b is an integer equal to the second integer from the input. If twice the value of b is divisible by 5, t is an integer equal to twice the value of b divided by 5. Otherwise, t is an integer equal to twice the value of b divided by 5 plus 1.***
