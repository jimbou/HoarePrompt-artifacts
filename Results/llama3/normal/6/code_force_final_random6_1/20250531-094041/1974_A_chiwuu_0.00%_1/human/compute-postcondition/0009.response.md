Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer. The current value of `t1` is either 2 times the value of `b` divided by 5 multiplied by 15 minus `b` multiplied by 4, if `t` is a multiple of 5, or 2b // 5 + 1 multiplied by 15 minus `b` multiplied by 4, if `t` is not a multiple of 5. The current value of `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`.**
