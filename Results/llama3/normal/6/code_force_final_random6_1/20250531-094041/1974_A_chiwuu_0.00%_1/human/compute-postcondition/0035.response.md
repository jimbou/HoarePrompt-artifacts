The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. At the for the `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `b` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `t` is an integer equal to twice the value of `b` divided by 5 if twice the value of `b` is divisible by 5, otherwise `t` is an integer equal to twice the value of `b` divided by 5 plus 1. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t1` is an integer equal to 15 times `t` minus 4 times `b`. Otherwise, if `t2` is divisible by 15, then `t` is updated to `t` plus `a` minus 15 times `t` minus 4 times `b` divided by 15. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t1` divided by 15 plus 1 plus `t`, and the value of `t` is being printed**
