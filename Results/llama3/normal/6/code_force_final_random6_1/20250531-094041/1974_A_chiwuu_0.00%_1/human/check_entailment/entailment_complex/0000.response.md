Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed to place the application icons.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of 1x1 icons and 2x2 icons, respectively.
2. It calculates the minimum number of screens needed to place the 2x2 icons, which is `b * 2` divided by 5, rounded up if necessary. This is because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells (5x3).
3. It calculates the remaining cells on the screens allocated for 2x2 icons, which is `t * 15 - b * 4`. This is because each screen has 15 cells, and each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.
4. If the remaining cells are sufficient to place all 1x1 icons (`t1 >= a`), it uses the calculated value of `t` as the minimum number of screens needed.
5. If the remaining cells are not sufficient to place all 1x1 icons (`t1 < a`), it calculates the additional screens needed to place the remaining 1x1 icons, which is `t2` divided by 15, rounded up if necessary.
6. It prints the calculated minimum number of screens needed for each test case.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
