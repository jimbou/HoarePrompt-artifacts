Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input is (0, 3), the program will output 2, but the correct output should be 2. However, if the input is (0, 4), the program will output 2, but the correct output should be 2. 

The issue with the program is that it does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed for the 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons. The program assumes that the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons can be used to place the 1x1 icons, but this is not always the case.

A correct solution would need to take into account the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons and calculate the minimum number of screens needed to place the 1x1 icons.
