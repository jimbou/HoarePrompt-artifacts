Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t1` is an integer, `t2` is an integer, `t` is either a multiple of 5 or not a multiple of 5, if `t` is a multiple of 5, then `t1` is 2(b // 5) * 15 - b * 4, otherwise `t1` is (2b // 5 + 1) * 15 - b * 4, `t1` is less than `a`, `t2` is equal to `a` minus `t1`. If `t2` is a multiple of 15, then `t` is equal to `t` plus `t2` divided by 15. Otherwise, `t` is equal to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`.**
