Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t1` is an integer, `t2` is not a multiple of 15, `t` is equal to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`, where `t2` is equal to `a` minus `t1`, and `t1` is either 2 times the value of `b` divided by 5 multiplied by 15 minus `b` multiplied by 4 or 2b // 5 + 1 multiplied by 15 minus `b` multiplied by 4, depending on whether `t` is a multiple of 5 or not.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been updated by adding `t2 // 15 + 1` to it. The values of `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `t1` remain unchanged. The value of `t2` is still not a multiple of 15, and its relationship with `a` and `t1` remains the same. The new value of `t` depends on the original value of `t` and the value of `t2`, which is calculated based on `a` and `t1`.
