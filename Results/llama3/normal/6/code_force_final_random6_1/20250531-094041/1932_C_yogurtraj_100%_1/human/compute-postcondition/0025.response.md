Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is an integer equal to the number of 'L' characters in t, y is a list of n integers where all elements are 0 except the last one which is k * a[q] % m and the second last one which is k, k is k * a[q] % m, q is either q1 or q2, q1 is either l - 1, l - 2, q2 is either l + 1, l, l + 2, ii is 0, stdin is empty, i is -1. If t[i] is 'R', then q is now q2 + 1 and k is k * a[q2] % m. If t[i] is not 'R', then q1 is either l - 2, l - 3, k is k * a[q1] % m, and the last two elements of y are k * a[q1] % m.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

*   The integer `n` and the list of integers `a` remain unchanged.
*   The integer `m` and the string `t` remain unchanged.
*   The integer `l` remains equal to the number of 'L' characters in `t`.
*   The list of integers `y` now contains non-zero values at all indices except the first one, which is still 0. The last element of `y` is `k * a[q] % m`, and the second last element of `y` is `k`.
*   The integer `k` is now `k * a[q] % m`.
*   The integer `q` is either `q1` or `q2`, and its value depends on whether `t[i]` is 'R' or not.
*   The integer `q1` is either `l - 1`, `l - 2`, or `l - 3`, and its value depends on whether `t[i]` is 'R' or not.
*   The integer `q2` is either `l + 1`, `l`, or `l + 2`, and its value depends on whether `t[i]` is 'R' or not.
*   The integer `ii` remains 0.
*   The standard input `stdin` remains empty.
*   The loop variable `i` is now -1, indicating that the loop has finished executing.
