Output State: **n is at least 3, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is an integer equal to the number of 'L' characters in t, y is a list of n integers where all elements are 0 except the last one which is k * a[q1] % m and the second last one which is k, k is k * a[q1] % m, q is either q1 or q2, q1 is either l - 2, q2 is either l + 1, l, l + 2, ii is 0, stdin is empty, i is n - 3**

In this final state, the value of `k` has been updated to `k * a[q1] % m`, and `q1` has been decremented by 1. The value of `y` has also been updated, with the last element now being `k * a[q1] % m` and the second last element being `k`. All other variables remain unchanged.
