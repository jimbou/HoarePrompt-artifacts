Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is an integer equal to the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` integers where all elements are 0 except the last one which is `k * a[q] % m` and the second last one which is `k`, `k` is `k * a[q] % m`, `q` is either `q1` or `q2`, `q1` is either `l - 1`, `l - 2`, `q2` is either `l + 1`, `l`, `l + 2`, `ii` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `i` is `n - 3`. If `t[i]` is 'R', then `q2` is `q2 + 1` and the last element of `y` is `k * a[q] % m * a[q2] % m` and the second last element of `y` is `k * a[q] % m`. Otherwise, `q1` is either `l - 2` and the last element of `y` is `k * a[q1] % m` and the second last element of `y` is `k`. The value of `y[i]` is now `k`.**

In this output state, the value of `y[i]` has been updated to `k`, while all other variables remain unchanged. The conditions and relationships between variables are still valid, with the exception of the updated value of `y[i]`.
