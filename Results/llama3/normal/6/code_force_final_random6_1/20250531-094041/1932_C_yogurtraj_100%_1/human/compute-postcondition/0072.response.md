Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is an integer equal to the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` integers where all elements are 0 except the last two elements which are `k * a[q] % m` and `k * a[q] % m` respectively, and the element at index `i` which is `n - 3` is `k`, `k` is `k * a[q] % m`, `q` is either `q1` or `q2`, `q1` is either `l - 2`, `l - 3`, or `l - 1` if `t[i]` is not 'R', otherwise `q1` is either `l - 3`, `l - 4`, or `l - 2`, `q2` is either `l`, `l + 1`, or `l + 2` if `t[i]` is not 'R', otherwise `q2` is either `l + 1`, `l + 2`, or `l + 3`, `ii` is 2, stdin is empty, `i` is `n - 3`, and if `t[i]` is 'R' then `q` is `q2`, otherwise `q` is `q1`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state except that the element at index `i` (which is `n - 3`) in the list `y` is now equal to `k`. All other variables remain unchanged.
