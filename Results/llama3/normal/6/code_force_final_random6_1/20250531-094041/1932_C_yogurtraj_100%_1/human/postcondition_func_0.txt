This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the result. It reads an integer t, followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and m, n integers a_1 to a_n, and a string s of n characters 'L' and 'R'. The function calculates a list y of n integers based on the input and prints the elements of y. The calculation involves iterating over the string s from right to left, updating the value of k based on the characters in s and the corresponding values in the list a, and storing the updated k values in the list y. The function repeats this process for each test case and prints the resulting list y for each case.
