Output State: **n is an integer that must be at least 3, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is an integer equal to the number of 'L' characters in t, y is a list of n integers where all elements are 0 except the last one which is either a[l - 1] % m or k * a[q1] % m and the second last one which is either a[l - 1] % m or k, k is either a[l - 1] % m or a[l] % m or k * a[q1] % m, q1 is either l - 3 or l - 2, q2 is either l or l + 1 or l + 2, ii is 1, stdin is empty, i is n-3, y[i] is k * a[q1] % m. If t[i] is 'R', then k is either a[l - 1] % m * a[q2] % m or a[l] % m * a[q2] % m. Otherwise, k is k * a[q1] % m and q1 is l - 3.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated to `k * a[q1] % m`, and `q1` has been decremented by 1. The value of `y[i]` has also been updated to `k * a[q1] % m`. All other variables remain unchanged.
