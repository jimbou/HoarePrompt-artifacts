Postcondition: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is an integer equal to the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` integers where all elements are 0 except the last one which is `k`, `k` is either `a[l - 1] % m` if `t[-1]` is 'L', otherwise `k` is `a[l] % m`, `q1` is either `l - 2` if `t[-1]` is 'L', otherwise `q1` is `l - 1`, `q2` is either `l` if `t[-1]` is 'L', otherwise `q2` is `l + 1`, `ii` is 2, `stdin` is empty, `i` is `n - 2`. The current value of `t[i]` is 'R'.**
