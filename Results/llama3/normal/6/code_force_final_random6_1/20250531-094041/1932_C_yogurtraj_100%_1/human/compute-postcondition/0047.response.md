To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head according to the loop statement.

The loop statement is `for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):`, which means that `i` will decrease by 1 in each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n-3`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be `n-4`.

The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one.

State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is an integer equal to the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` integers where all elements are 0 except the last one which is either `a[l - 1] % m` or `k * a[q1] % m` and the second last one which is either `a[l - 1] % m` or `k`, `k` is either `a[l - 1] % m * a[q2] % m` or `a[l] % m * a[q2] % m` if `t[i]` is 'R', otherwise `k` is `k * a[q1] % m`, `q1` is either `l - 2` or `l - 1` or `l - 3`, `q2` is either `l` or `l + 1` or `l + 2` or `l + 3`, `ii` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is `n-4`, `y[i]` is `k`, `y[i+1]` is either `k * a[q2] % m` if `t[i+1]` is 'R', otherwise `y[i+1]` is `k * a[q1] % m**
