Output State: **n is an integer that must be at least 3, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is an integer equal to the number of 'L' characters in t, y is a list of n integers where all elements are 0 except the last one which is either a[l - 1] % m or k * a[q1] % m and the second last one which is either a[l - 1] % m or k, k is either a[l - 1] % m * a[q2] % m or a[l] % m * a[q2] % m if t[i] is 'R', otherwise k is k * a[q1] % m, q1 is either l - 2 or l - 1 or l - 3, q2 is either l or l + 1 or l + 2 or l + 3, ii is 1, stdin is empty, i is n-3, y[i] is k, y[i+1] is either k * a[q2] % m if t[i+1] is 'R', otherwise y[i+1] is k * a[q1] % m**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of y at index i is now equal to k. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The list y now has a new value at index i, which is k. The rest of the elements in y are still 0 except the last one and the second last one, which are still either a[l - 1] % m or k * a[q1] % m and either a[l - 1] % m or k respectively.
