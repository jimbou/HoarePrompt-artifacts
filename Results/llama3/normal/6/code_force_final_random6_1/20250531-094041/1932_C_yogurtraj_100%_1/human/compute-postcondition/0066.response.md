Postcondition: **n is an integer that must be at least 3, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is an integer equal to the number of 'L' characters in t, y is a list of n integers where all elements are 0 except the last one which is k * a[q] % m, k is k * a[q] % m, q is either q1 or q2, q1 is either l - 2, l - 3, or l - 1, q2 is either l, l + 1, or l + 2, ii is 2, stdin is empty, i is n - 2, and if t[i] is 'R' then q is q2, otherwise q is q1.**
