The only variable in the loop head is variable `ii` and `int(input())`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `int(input())`. If `int(input())` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains an integer t, so it needs to be adjusted to `int(input())` is greater than 0 and `ii` is now 0. 
State: **stdin contains an integer t that must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0**
