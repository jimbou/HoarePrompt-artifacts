Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is an integer equal to the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` integers where all elements are 0 except the last one, the second last one and the element at index `i` which is `k`, `k` is an integer, `q` is either `q1` or `q2`, `q1` is either `l - 1`, `l - 2`, `q2` is either `l + 1`, `l`, `l + 2`, `ii` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `i` is `n - 4`. If `t[i]` is 'R', then `q` is now `q2 + 1` and `k` is `k * a[q2] % m`. If `t[i]` is not 'R', then `q1` is either `l - 2`, `l - 3`, `k` is `k * a[q1] % m`, and the last two elements of `y` are `k * a[q1] % m`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state except that the element at index `i` in the list `y` is now equal to `k`. The other variables remain unchanged.
