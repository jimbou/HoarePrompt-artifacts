Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input string `t` contains only 'L's or only 'R's. In this case, the program will not correctly calculate the product of the remaining elements in the array `a` after each command.

For example, if the input is:

```
1
5 1
1 1 1 1 1
LLLLL
```

The program will output:

```
0 0 0 0 0
```

However, the correct output should be:

```
1 1 1 1 1
```

This is because when the input string `t` contains only 'L's, the program should calculate the product of the remaining elements in the array `a` from left to right, but the program does not do this correctly.
