Postcondition: **n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is an integer equal to the number of 'L' characters in t, y is a list of n integers where all elements are 0 except the last one which is either a[l - 1] % m or k * a[q1] % m and the second last one which is either a[l - 1] % m or k, k is either a[l - 1] % m or a[l] % m, q1 is either l - 2 or l - 1, q2 is either l or l + 1, ii is 1, stdin is empty, i is -1. If t[-1] is 'L', then the last two elements of y are a[l - 1] % m and the list y is printed. Otherwise, the last two elements of y are k * a[q1] % m and the list y is printed.**
