The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is greater than -1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 3`, `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again `i` must be `n - 4` and for the loop to execute again `n` must be at least 4.
State: **`n` is at least 4, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is an integer equal to the number of 'L' characters in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` integers where all elements are 0 except the last one which is `k * a[q] % m` and the second last one which is `k`, `k` is `k * a[q] % m`, `q` is either `q1` or `q2`, `q1` is either `l - 1`, `l - 2`, `q2` is either `l + 1`, `l`, `l + 2`, `ii` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `i` is `n - 4`.**
