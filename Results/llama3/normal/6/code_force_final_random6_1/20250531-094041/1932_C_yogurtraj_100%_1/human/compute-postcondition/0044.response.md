Postcondition: ***n is an integer that must be at least 3, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is an integer equal to the number of 'L' characters in t, y is a list of n integers where all elements are 0 except the last one which is either a[l - 1] % m or k * a[q1] % m and the second last one which is either a[l - 1] % m or k, k is either a[l - 1] % m or a[l] % m or k * a[q1] % m, q1 is either l - 2 or l - 1 or l - 3, q2 is either l or l + 1 or l + 2 or l + 3, ii is 1, stdin is empty, i is n-3. If t[i] is 'R', then y[i] is k * a[q2] % m and k is either a[l - 1] % m * a[q2] % m or a[l] % m * a[q2] % m. Otherwise, y[i] is k * a[q1] % m and k is k * a[q1] % m * a[q2] % m or k * a[q1] % m. q1 is either l - 2 or l - 3.
