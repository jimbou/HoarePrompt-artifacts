Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of three lines: two integers n and m (1 <= n <= 2*10^5, 1 <= m <= 10^4), n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^4), and a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.
Code of the loop:
for ii in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    t = input()
    l = t.count('L')
    k = 0
    q1 = 0
    q2 = 0
    if t[-1] == 'L':
        k = a[l - 1] % m
        q1 = l - 2
        q2 = l
    else:
        k = a[l] % m
        q1 = l - 1
        q2 = l + 1
    y = [0] * n
    y[-1] = k
    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
        if t[i] == 'R':
            k = k * a[q2] % m
            q2 += 1
        else:
            k = k * a[q1] % m
            q1 -= 1
        y[i] = k
    print(*y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is an integer equal to the number of 'L' characters in t, y is a list of n integers where all elements are 0 except the last one which is k * a[q] % m and the second last one which is k, k is k * a[q] % m, q is either q1 or q2, q1 is either l - 1, l - 2, q2 is either l + 1, l, l + 2, ii is 0, stdin is empty, i is -1. If t[i] is 'R', then q is now q2 + 1 and k is k * a[q2] % m. If t[i] is not 'R', then q1 is either l - 2, l - 3, k is k * a[q1] % m, and the last two elements of y are k * a[q1] % m, and the list y is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer that must be at least 3, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is an integer equal to the number of 'L' characters in t, y is a list of n integers where all elements are 0 except the last one which is either a[l - 1] % m or k * a[q1] % m and the second last one which is either a[l - 1] % m or k, k is either a[l - 1] % m * a[q2] % m or a[l] % m * a[q2] % m if t[i] is 'R', otherwise k is k * a[q1] % m, q1 is either l - 2 or l - 1 or l - 3 or ... or 0, q2 is either l or l + 1 or l + 2 or l + 3 or ... or n-1, ii is 1, stdin is empty, i is -1, y[i] is k, y[i+1] is either k * a[q2] % m if t[i+1] is 'R', otherwise y[i+1] is k * a[q1] % m, and the list y is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer that must be at least 3, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is an integer equal to the number of 'L' characters in t, y is a list of n integers where all elements are 0 except the last n - 1 elements which are k * a[q] % m, k is k * a[q] % m, q is either q1 or q2, q1 is either l - 2, l - 3, or l - 1, q2 is either l, l + 1, or l + 2, ii is 2, stdin is empty, i is -1, and if t[i] is 'R' then q is q2, otherwise q is q1, and the elements of y are printed, y (where y is a list of n integers where all elements are 0 except the last n - 1 elements which are k * a[q] % m)




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
