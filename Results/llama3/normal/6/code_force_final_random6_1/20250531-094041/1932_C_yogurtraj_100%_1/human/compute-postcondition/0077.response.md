Output State: **n is an integer that must be at least 3, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is an integer equal to the number of 'L' characters in t, y is a list of n integers where all elements are 0 except the last two elements which are k * a[q] % m and k * a[q] % m respectively, and the element at index i which is n - 4 is k * a[q1] % m * a[q1] % m if t[i] is not 'R', otherwise k * a[q2] % m, k is k * a[q1] % m * a[q1] % m if t[i] is not 'R', otherwise k * a[q2] % m, q is either q1 or q2, q1 is either l - 2, l - 3, or l - 1 if t[i] is not 'R', otherwise q1 is either l - 3, l - 4, or l - 2, q2 is either l, l + 1, or l + 2 if t[i] is not 'R', otherwise q2 is either l + 1, l + 2, or l + 3, ii is 2, stdin is empty, i is n - 4, and if t[i] is 'R' then q is q2, otherwise q is q1. If t[i] is 'R', then q2 is q2 + 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of y at index i (which is n - 4) is updated to k * a[q1] % m * a[q1] % m if t[i] is not 'R', otherwise k * a[q2] % m. The value of k is also updated to k * a[q1] % m * a[q1] % m if t[i] is not 'R', otherwise k * a[q2] % m. The values of other variables remain the same.
