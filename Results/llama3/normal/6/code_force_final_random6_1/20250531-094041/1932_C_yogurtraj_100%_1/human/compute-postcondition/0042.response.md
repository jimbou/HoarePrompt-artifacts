Output State: **n is an integer that must be at least 3, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is an integer equal to the number of 'L' characters in t, y is a list of n integers where all elements are 0 except the last one which is either a[l - 1] % m or k * a[q1] % m and the second last one which is either a[l - 1] % m or k, k is either a[l - 1] % m * a[q2] % m or a[l] % m * a[q2] % m, q1 is either l - 2 or l - 1, q2 is either l + 1 or l + 2 or l + 3, ii is 1, stdin is empty, i is n-3, y[i] is k * a[q2] % m. If t[i] is 'R', then k is either a[l - 1] % m * a[q2] % m * a[q2] % m or a[l] % m * a[q2] % m * a[q2] % m. Otherwise, k is k * a[q2] % m * a[q1] % m and q1 is l - 2.**

The code modifies the values of `k` and `q2`. The first line updates the value of `k` by multiplying it with `a[q2]` and taking the modulus `m`. The second line increments `q2` by 1. The value of `k` is affected by the previous value of `k`, `a[q2]`, and `m`. The value of `q2` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
