Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer decreased by 1, N is a positive integer, nums is a sorted list of n+1 positive integers that must have at least n+1 elements, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer n. The second line contains n integers. The difference between the (i+1)th element and the ith element of nums is 1 for all i from 0 to n-2, then cd is n-1 and i is n-2. Otherwise, cd is the number of consecutive differences of 1 between the elements of nums and i is the index of the last element of the sequence of consecutive differences of 1. The current value of cd is an odd number.***
