Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Alice and Bob are playing a game on n piles of stones. On each player's turn,
they select a positive integer k that is at most the size of the smallest
nonempty pile and remove k stones from each nonempty pile at once. The first
player who is unable to make a move (because all piles are empty) loses.

Given that Alice goes first, who will win the game if both players play
optimally?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le
2\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of piles in the game.

The next line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ), where a_i is the initial number of stones in the i -th
pile.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line with the name of the winner, assuming
both players play optimally. If Alice wins, print "Alice", otherwise print
"Bob" (without quotes).

    5 7 2 9 6 3 3 2
    
    1
    
    1000000000

Output

    Alice
    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice can win by choosing k=3 on her first turn, which
will empty all of the piles at once.

In the second test case, Alice must choose k=1 on her first turn since there
is a pile of size 1 , so Bob can win on the next turn by choosing k=6 .

    #State: t is a positive integer decreased by 1, N is a positive integer, nums is a sorted list of n+1 positive integers that must have at least n+1 elements, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer n. The second line contains n integers. If the difference between the (i+1)th element and the ith element of nums is 1 for all i from 0 to n-2, then cd is n-1 and i is n-2. Otherwise, cd is the number of consecutive differences of 1 between the elements of nums and i is the index of the last element of the sequence of consecutive differences of 1.
    if (cd & 1) :
        return print('Bob')
        #The program returns and prints the string 'Bob'
    else :
        return print('Alice')
        #The program prints 'Alice' and returns None.

#Overall this is what the function does:Determines the winner of a game based on a sequence of numbers. The function reads a test case from standard input, where the first line contains the number of integers and the second line contains the integers themselves. It then checks the sequence of numbers and prints 'Alice' or 'Bob' depending on the sequence's properties, specifically the length of the sequence and the presence of consecutive differences of 1. The function handles four cases: a sequence of one number, a sequence of two numbers, a sequence with an odd number of consecutive differences of 1, and a sequence with an even number of consecutive differences of 1.
