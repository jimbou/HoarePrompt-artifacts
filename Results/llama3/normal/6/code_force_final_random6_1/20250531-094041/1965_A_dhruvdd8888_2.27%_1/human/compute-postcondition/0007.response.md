Output State: **t is a positive integer decreased by 1, N is a positive integer, nums is a sorted list of n+1 positive integers, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer n. The second line contains n integers. The length of nums is more than 2, cd is 0**

The code inserts a 0 at the beginning of the sorted list `nums`, increasing its length by 1. The variable `cd` is assigned a value of 0. No other variables are affected. The state of `t`, `N`, and the contents of `stdin` remain unchanged.
