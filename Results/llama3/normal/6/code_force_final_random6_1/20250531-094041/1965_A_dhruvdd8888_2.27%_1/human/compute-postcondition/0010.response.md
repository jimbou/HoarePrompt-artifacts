Output State: **t is a positive integer decreased by 1, N is a positive integer, nums is a sorted list of n+1 positive integers that must have at least 3 elements, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer n. The second line contains n integers, cd is 1, i is 0. The current value of i is such that the difference between the (i+1)th element and the ith element of nums is 1.**

The code increments the value of `cd` by 1, so its new value is 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-1 test cases, and the current value of `i` is still such that the difference between the (i+1)th element and the ith element of `nums` is 1.
