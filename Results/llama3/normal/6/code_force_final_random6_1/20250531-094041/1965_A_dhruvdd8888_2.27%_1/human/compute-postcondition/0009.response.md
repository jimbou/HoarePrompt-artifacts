Postcondition: **t is a positive integer decreased by 1, N is a positive integer, nums is a sorted list of n+1 positive integers that must have at least 3 elements, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer n. The second line contains n integers, cd is 0, i is 0. The current value of i is such that the difference between the (i+1)th element and the ith element of nums is 1.**
