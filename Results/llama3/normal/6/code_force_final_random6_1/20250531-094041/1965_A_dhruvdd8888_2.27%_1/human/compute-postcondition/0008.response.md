The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and nums, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `nums`. If the length of nums is at least 3, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, t is a positive integer decreased by 1, N is a positive integer, nums is a sorted list of n+1 positive integers, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer n. The second line contains n integers. The length of nums is more than 2, cd is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `nums` has at least 3 elements and i is now 0. 
State: **t is a positive integer decreased by 1, N is a positive integer, nums is a sorted list of n+1 positive integers that must have at least 3 elements, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer n. The second line contains n integers, cd is 0, i is 0**
