Output State: **`t` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `N` is a positive integer, `nums` is a sorted list of n+1 positive integers that must have at least 4 elements, `cd` is 1, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer n. The second line contains n integers, if the difference between the (i+1)th element and the ith element of nums is 1, then cd is 1 and i is 1. Otherwise, cd is 0 and i is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cd` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The value of `i` is still 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-1 test cases, each with two lines: an integer n and a list of n integers. The condition for `cd` and `i` is still dependent on the difference between consecutive elements in `nums`.
