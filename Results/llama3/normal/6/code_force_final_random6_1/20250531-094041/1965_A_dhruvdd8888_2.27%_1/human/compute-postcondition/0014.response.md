The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and nums, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the nums.  If the list has at least 4 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, nums has at least 3 elements, i is 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 4 elements and the i is 1.
State: **t is a positive integer decreased by 1, N is a positive integer, nums is a sorted list of n+1 positive integers that must have at least 4 elements, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer n. The second line contains n integers, if the difference between the (i+1)th element and the ith element of nums is 1, then cd is 1 and i is 1. Otherwise, cd is 0 and i is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
