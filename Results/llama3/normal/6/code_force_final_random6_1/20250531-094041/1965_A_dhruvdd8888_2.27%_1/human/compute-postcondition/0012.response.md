Output State: **`t` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `N` is a positive integer, `nums` is a sorted list of `n+1` positive integers that must have at least 3 elements, stdin contains `t-1` test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer `n`. The second line contains `n` integers, `cd` is 0, `i` is 0. The difference between the element at index `i+1` and the element at index `i` in the list `nums` is not equal to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `t`, `N`, `nums`, `cd`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The stdin still contains `t-1` test cases, each with two lines: the first line contains an integer `n`, and the second line contains `n` integers. The list `nums` is still a sorted list of `n+1` positive integers with at least 3 elements, and the difference between the element at index `i+1` and the element at index `i` is still not equal to 1.
