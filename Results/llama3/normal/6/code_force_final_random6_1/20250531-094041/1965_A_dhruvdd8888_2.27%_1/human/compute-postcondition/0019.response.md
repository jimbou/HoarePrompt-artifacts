Output State: **`t` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `N` is a positive integer, `nums` is a sorted list of n+1 positive integers that must have at least 5 elements, `cd` is either 1 or 2, if `cd` is 1 then `i` is 2, if `cd` is 2 then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer n. The second line contains n integers.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cd` has been incremented by 1. If the difference between the (i+1)th element and the ith element of `nums` is 1, then `cd` is now 2 and `i` is still 2. Otherwise, `cd` is now 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of `t`, `N`, and `nums` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-1 test cases, each with two lines: an integer n and n integers.
