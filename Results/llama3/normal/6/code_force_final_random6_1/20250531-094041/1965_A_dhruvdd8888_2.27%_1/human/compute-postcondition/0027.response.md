Functionality: **Determines the winner of a game based on a sequence of numbers. The function reads a test case from standard input, where the first line contains the number of integers and the second line contains the integers themselves. It then checks the sequence of numbers and prints 'Alice' or 'Bob' depending on the sequence's properties, specifically the length of the sequence and the presence of consecutive differences of 1. The function handles four cases: a sequence of one number, a sequence of two numbers, a sequence with an odd number of consecutive differences of 1, and a sequence with an even number of consecutive differences of 1.**
