Output State: **t is a positive integer decreased by 1, N is a positive integer, nums is a sorted list of n+1 positive integers that must have at least 4 elements, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer n. The second line contains n integers, if the difference between the (i+1)th element and the ith element of nums is 1, then cd is 1 and i is 1. Otherwise, cd is 0 and i is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, but the values of the variables do not change. The stdin still contains t-1 test cases, each with two lines. The first line contains an integer n, and the second line contains n integers. The conditions for cd and i remain the same, depending on the difference between consecutive elements in nums.
