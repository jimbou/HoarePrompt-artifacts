Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer decreased by 1, N is a positive integer, nums is a sorted list of n+1 positive integers that must have at least 3 elements, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer n. The second line contains n integers, cd is 0, i is 0. The difference between the element at index i+1 and the element at index i in the list nums is not equal to 1***
