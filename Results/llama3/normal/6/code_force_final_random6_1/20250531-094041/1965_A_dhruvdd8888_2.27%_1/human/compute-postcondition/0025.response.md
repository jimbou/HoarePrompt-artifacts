Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer decreased by 1, N is a positive integer, nums is a sorted list of n+1 positive integers that must have at least n+1 elements, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer n. The second line contains n integers. The number of consecutive differences of 1 between the elements of nums is even***
