Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^4, a is a list of strings, b is a list of strings, _ is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases**

The code block reads an integer value from stdin and assigns it to `n`, then reads two lines of input and assigns them to `a` and `b` respectively. The value of `_` remains unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin decreases by 2.
