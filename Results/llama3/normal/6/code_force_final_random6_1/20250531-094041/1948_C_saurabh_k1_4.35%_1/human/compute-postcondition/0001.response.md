Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^4, a is a list of strings, b is a list of strings, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`, which is between 1 and 10^4. The second line assigns a list of strings to `a` from the next input, which is a list of characters. The third line assigns a list of strings to `b` from the next input, which is also a list of characters. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0. After these operations, stdin contains t-1 test cases.
