The only variable in the loop head is the variable `_` and the expression `int(input())`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `int(input())`. If `int(input())` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. So for the loop to be executed  the value of `int(input())` must be at least 1 and the variable `_` is 0.
State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases, _ is 0, int(input()) must be at least 1**
