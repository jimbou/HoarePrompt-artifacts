To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `input()`. The `input()` function reads a value from the standard input (`stdin`).

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:

* `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4
* `a` is a list of strings
* `b` is a list of strings
* `_` is 0
* `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases

For the loop to execute again, the `input()` function must read a new value from `stdin`. Since `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, there must be at least one more test case left for the loop to execute again.

The value of `_` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration. Since `_` is 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 1 at the start of the next iteration.

The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `a` is a list of strings, `b` is a list of strings, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases**
