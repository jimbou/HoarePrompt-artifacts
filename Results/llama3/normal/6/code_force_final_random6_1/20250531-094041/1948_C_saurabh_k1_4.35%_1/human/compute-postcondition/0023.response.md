Output State: **_ is t-1, stdin is empty. If the second last element of b is '<', then 'No' is printed. Otherwise, 'Yes' is printed.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the loop counter `_` will be equal to `t-1`, and the standard input `stdin` will be empty because all test cases have been processed. The output will be either 'No' or 'Yes' depending on the value of the second last element of list `b`.
