Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

* The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
* For each test case, it reads the number of columns `n` and the two strings `a` and `b` representing the grid.
* The program then checks the second last element of the second row `b` (at index `n-2`). If it's '<', it means the robot cannot reach the cell (2, n) because the arrow points to the left, and the robot cannot move outside the grid. In this case, it prints 'No'.
* If the second last element of `b` is not '<', it means the robot can reach the cell (2, n) because the arrow points to the right, and the robot can move along the arrow. In this case, it prints 'Yes'.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the given grid configuration.

Correctness: **True**
