Reasoning:

The given program is correct. The program checks if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) by examining the second last element of the second row (b). If the second last element is '<', it means the robot will move left and cannot reach the cell (2, n), so it prints 'No'. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.

The program's logic is correct because the robot's movement is determined by the arrows in the grid, and the second last element of the second row is the only one that can prevent the robot from reaching the cell (2, n). If the second last element is '>', the robot can move right and reach the cell (2, n).

Correctness: **True**
