To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The objects involved are `_` and `stdin`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 1, and `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases.

For the loop to execute again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `stdin` needs to have at least one more test case.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `_` is 2
* `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases

The other variables `n`, `a`, `b` are not involved in the loop head, so their states remain the same.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `a` is a list of strings, `b` is a list of strings, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases**
