Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n). It only checks the direction of the arrow in the second row at index n-2, but it does not consider the directions of the arrows in the rest of the grid.

For example, consider the following input:

4
>><<
>><>

The program will print 'Yes', but the robot cannot reach the cell (2, 4) because the arrow at (1, 2) points to the left, which will cause the robot to move to (1, 1) and then get stuck in an infinite loop.

A correct solution would need to simulate the robot's movement and check all possible paths to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n).
