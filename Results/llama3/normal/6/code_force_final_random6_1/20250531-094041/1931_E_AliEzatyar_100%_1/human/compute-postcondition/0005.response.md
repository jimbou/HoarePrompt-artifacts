Output State: **`num` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `counter` is 0, i is the last index of the list, and the last element of `num` is not equal to '0' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `num`, `counter`, and `i` remain unchanged, as the `break` statement only exits the innermost loop or if statement, without modifying any variables. The last element of `num` is still not equal to '0', as this condition was a precondition and has not been altered by the code.
