Postcondition: ***`num` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is the third last index of the list. If `num[i]` is equal to '0', then `counter` is either 1, 2, or 3. Otherwise, `counter` is either 0, 1, or 2 depending on the previous iteration's conditions, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
