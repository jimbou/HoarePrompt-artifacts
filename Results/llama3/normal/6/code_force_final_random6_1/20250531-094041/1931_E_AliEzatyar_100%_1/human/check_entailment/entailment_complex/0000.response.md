Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It accurately implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the problem description.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program correctly reads the input and initializes the necessary variables.
2. The `func_1` function correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in a given integer.
3. The program correctly calculates the total number of digits in the list and the number of zeros that can be removed by Anna.
4. The program correctly determines the winner of the game by comparing the total number of digits minus the number of zeros that can be removed by Anna with the value of `m + 1`.

The program's logic is sound, and it accurately implements the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
