Output State: **`num` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is the second last index of the list, `counter` is either 1 or 2 depending on the last element of `num`**

In this output state, the value of `counter` has been incremented by 1. Since `counter` was initially either 0 or 1 depending on the last element of `num`, it is now either 1 or 2 depending on the last element of `num`. The values of `num` and `i` remain unchanged.
