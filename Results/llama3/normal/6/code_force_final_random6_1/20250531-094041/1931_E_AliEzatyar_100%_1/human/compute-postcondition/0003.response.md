The code increments the value of `counter` by 1. The initial value of `counter` is 0, so after the increment, `counter` becomes 1. The other variables, `num` and `i`, are not affected by the code.

Output State: **`num` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `counter` is 1, `i` is the last index of the list, and the current value of `num[i]` is '0'.**
