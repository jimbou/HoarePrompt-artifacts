Output State: **`num` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is the third last index of the list, `counter` is either 0, 1, or 2 depending on the previous iteration's conditions, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `num`, `i`, and `counter` remain unchanged because the `break` statement only exits the current loop or if statement without modifying any variables. The `num` list still contains at least one integer, `i` is still the third last index of the list, and `counter` still has a value of either 0, 1, or 2 based on the previous iteration's conditions. The only change is that we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
