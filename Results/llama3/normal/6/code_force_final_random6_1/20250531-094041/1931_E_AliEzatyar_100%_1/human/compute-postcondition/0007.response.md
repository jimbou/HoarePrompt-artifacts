To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):`. This means that the loop will iterate over the indices of the list `num` in reverse order, starting from the last index and moving towards the first index.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the last index of the list. To execute the loop again, `i` needs to be decremented by 1, since the loop iterates in reverse order.

The state of `num` does not need to be adjusted, as it is not modified by the loop head.

The state of `counter` is not directly related to the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`num` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is the second last index of the list, `counter` is either 0 or 1 depending on the last element of `num`**

Note that the state of `counter` is not changed, as it is not directly related to the loop head. Its value depends on the last element of `num`, which is not modified by the loop head.
