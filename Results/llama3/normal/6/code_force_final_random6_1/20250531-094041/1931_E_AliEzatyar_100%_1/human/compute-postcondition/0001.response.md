The only objects in the loop head are variables  i and num, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the num.  If the list has at least 1 integer the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, counter is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 integer and the i is the last index of the list.
State: **`num` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `counter` is 0, i is the last index of the list**
