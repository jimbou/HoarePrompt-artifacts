Output State: **`num` is a list of integers, where the first integer is the number of test cases, and each subsequent integer is either the number of integers in the list or an integer in the list, `counter` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `num` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it. However, a new variable `counter` is introduced and assigned the value 0.
