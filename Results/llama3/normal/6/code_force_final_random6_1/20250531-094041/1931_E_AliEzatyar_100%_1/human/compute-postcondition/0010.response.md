Postcondition: ***`num` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is the second last index of the list. If `num[i]` is equal to '0', `counter` is either 1 or 2 depending on the last element of `num`. Otherwise, `counter` is either 0 or 1 depending on the last element of `num`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
