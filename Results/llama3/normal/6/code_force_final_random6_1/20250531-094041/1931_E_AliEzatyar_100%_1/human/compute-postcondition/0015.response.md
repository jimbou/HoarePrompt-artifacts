Output State: **`num` is a list of integers, `i` is -1, and `counter` is the number of trailing zeros in the list.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the list `num` remains unchanged, the index `i` becomes -1 (since the loop iterates from the last index to -1), and the counter variable `counter` will hold the count of trailing zeros in the list.
