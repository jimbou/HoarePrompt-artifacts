#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is a list of integers, where the first integer is the number of test cases, and each subsequent integer is either the number of integers in the list or an integer in the list.
    counter = 0
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
        if num[i] == '0':
            counter += 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: `num` is a list of integers, `i` is -1, and `counter` is the number of trailing zeros in the list.
    return counter
    #The program returns the number of trailing zeros in the list `num`.

#Overall this is what the function does:Counts and returns the number of trailing zeros in a given list of integers, ignoring any non-integer values and stopping at the first non-zero integer encountered from the end of the list.
