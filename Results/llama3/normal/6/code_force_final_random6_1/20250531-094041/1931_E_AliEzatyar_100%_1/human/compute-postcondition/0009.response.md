Output State: **`num` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is the second last index of the list, `counter` is either 0 or 1 depending on the last element of `num`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `num`, `i`, and `counter` remain unchanged, as the `break` statement only exits the current loop or if statement, without modifying any variables. The condition that `num` has at least 1 integer, `i` is the second last index of the list, and `counter` is either 0 or 1 depending on the last element of `num` still holds true. Additionally, we note that we have exited the most internal loop or if statement.
