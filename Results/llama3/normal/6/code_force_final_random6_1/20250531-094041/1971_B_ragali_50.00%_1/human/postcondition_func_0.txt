This function reads a series of strings from standard input, checks if each string has more than one unique character, and if so, prints 'YES' followed by a modified version of the string. The modified string is either the original string rotated by half its length or its reverse, whichever is different from the original string. If the string has only one unique character, it prints 'NO'. The function processes all input strings and then terminates, leaving the input stream empty.
