Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when the input string is "ab", the program will output "YES" and "ba", which is correct. However, when the input string is "aa", the program will output "YES" and "aa", which is incorrect because the rearranged string "aa" is equal to the original string "aa".

The issue with the program is that it does not correctly handle the case where the input string has only two distinct characters. In this case, the program will always output the reversed string, which may not be different from the original string. To fix this, the program needs to be modified to handle this special case correctly.
