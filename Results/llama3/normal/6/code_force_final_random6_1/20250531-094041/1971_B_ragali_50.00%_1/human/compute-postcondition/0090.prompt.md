Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    s = input().strip(' ')
    a = set()
    for i in s:
        a.add(i)
    if len(a) > 1:
        print('YES')
        newstr = s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]
        isreverse = s[::-1]
        if newstr != s:
            print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2])
        elif isreverse != s:
            print(isreverse)
        else:
            print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[0:len(s) // 2])
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is equal to the length of `s`, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10, `a` is a set containing all unique characters in `s`, stdin contains `t-1` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10. If `a` has more than one unique character, 'YES' is printed, and if the string `s` is not a palindrome, the string `s` in reverse order is printed. Otherwise, the second half of `s` followed by the first half of `s` is printed. If `a` has only one unique character, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), i is equal to the length of s plus 1, s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10, a is a set containing all unique characters in s, stdin contains t-3 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10. If a contains more than one unique character, a new string newstr is formed by concatenating the second half of s with the first half of s. If newstr is not equal to s, then newstr is printed. If newstr is equal to s, then if the reverse of s is not equal to s, the reverse of s is printed. Otherwise, s is printed and 'YES' is printed. If a contains only one unique character, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), i is the last character in the string s, s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10, a is a set containing all unique characters in the string s, stdin contains t-5 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10. If a has more than one element, 'YES' is printed. If the second half of s followed by the first half of s is not equal to s, then the second half of s followed by the first half of s is printed. If s is a palindrome, then the reverse of s is printed, which is equal to s. If a has only one element, 'NO' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
