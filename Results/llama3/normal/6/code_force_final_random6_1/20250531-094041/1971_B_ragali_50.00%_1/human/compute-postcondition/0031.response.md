Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), i is equal to the length of s plus 1, s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10, a is an empty set, stdin contains t-3 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10.**

The code reads a string from stdin and assigns it to `s`, stripping any leading or trailing spaces. This does not affect the values of `t`, `i`, or `a`. The second line initializes an empty set `a`. The initial state's conditions on `t`, `i`, and `s` remain valid, but `a` is now empty. Stdin now contains `t-3` strings.
