The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to the length of `s`, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 and `t` must be greater than `i`. 
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is equal to the length of `s` plus 1, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10, `a` is a set containing all unique characters in `s`, stdin contains `t-2` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10. If `a` has more than one unique character, 'YES' is printed, and if the string `s` is not a palindrome, the string `s` in reverse order is printed. Otherwise, the second half of `s` followed by the first half of `s` is printed. If `a` has only one unique character, 'NO' is printed.**
