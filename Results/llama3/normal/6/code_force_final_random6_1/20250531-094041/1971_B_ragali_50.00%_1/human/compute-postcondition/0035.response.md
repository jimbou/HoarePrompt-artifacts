The code `a.add(i)` adds the value of `i` to the set `a`. Since `a` already contains the integer `i`, this operation does not change the value of `a`. The other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is at least 2, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at least 2 and at most 10, `a` is a set containing the integer `i`, stdin contains `t-3` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10**
