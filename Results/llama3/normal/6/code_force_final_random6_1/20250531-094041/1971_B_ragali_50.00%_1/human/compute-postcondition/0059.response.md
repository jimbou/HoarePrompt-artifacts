Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), i is equal to the length of s plus 1, s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10, a is a set containing all unique characters in s, stdin contains t-3 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10. If a contains more than one unique character, a new string newstr is formed by concatenating the second half of s with the first half of s. If newstr is not equal to s, then newstr is printed. If newstr is equal to s, then if the reverse of s is not equal to s, the reverse of s is printed. Otherwise, s is printed and 'YES' is printed. If a contains only one unique character, 'NO' is printed.***
