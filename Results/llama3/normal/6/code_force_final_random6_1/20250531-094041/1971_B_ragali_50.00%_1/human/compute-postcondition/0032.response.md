To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `s`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` has at least 1 character, the loop can execute. Since `i` is equal to the length of `s` plus 1, we need to adjust `i` to be at least 1 and `s` to have at least 1 character.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is at least 1, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at least 1 and at most 10, `a` is an empty set, stdin contains `t-3` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10**
