The code prints the string `isreverse` which consists of the characters of `s` in reverse order. Since `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10, `isreverse` will be a string of the same length, containing the characters of `s` in reverse order.

Output: **the characters of s in reverse order**
