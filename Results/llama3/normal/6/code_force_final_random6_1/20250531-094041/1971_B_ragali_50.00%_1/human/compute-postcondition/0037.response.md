Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is the third character in the string `s`, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at least 3 and at most 10, `a` is a set containing the integer `i` at least twice, stdin contains `t-3` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged, still an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive). The value of `i` also remains unchanged, still the third character in the string `s`. The string `s` also remains unchanged, still consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at least 3 and at most 10. The set `a` now contains the integer `i` at least twice, since `i` was already in the set and we added it again. The stdin still contains `t-3` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10.
