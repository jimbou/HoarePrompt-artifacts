The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and s, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s` has at least 3 characters, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has at least 2 characters, `i` is at least 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time the string `s` must have at least 3 characters and `i` is the third character in the string `s`.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is the third character in the string `s`, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at least 3 and at most 10, `a` is a set containing the integer `i`, stdin contains `t-3` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10**
