Based on the precondition, the print statement will print the reverse of the string s.

The variable `isreverse` is described as the reverse of the string s. Since s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10, the reverse of s will also be a string of the same length, but with the characters in reverse order.

For example, if s is the string "hello", then `isreverse` would be the string "olleh".

Therefore, the print statement will output the reverse of the string s.

Output: **the reverse of the string s**
