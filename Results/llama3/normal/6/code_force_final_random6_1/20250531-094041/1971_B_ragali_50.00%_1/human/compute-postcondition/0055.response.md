Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), i is equal to the length of s plus 1, s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10, a is a set containing all unique characters in s, stdin contains t-3 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10, newstr is a string consisting of the second half of s followed by the first half of s, isreverse is a string consisting of the characters of s in reverse order, and 'YES' is being printed. If newstr is not equal to s, then the second half of s followed by the first half of s is printed. If newstr is equal to s, then if isreverse is not equal to s, isreverse is printed. Otherwise, the string formed by concatenating the second half of s with the first half of s, which is equal to s, is printed.***
