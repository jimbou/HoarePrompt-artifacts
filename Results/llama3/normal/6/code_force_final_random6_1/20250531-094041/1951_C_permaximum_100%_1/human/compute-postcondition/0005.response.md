According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tickets_bought` and `k`. If `tickets_bought` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `tickets_bought` is increased by the number of tickets bought and less than `k`, so for the loop to be executed one more time `tickets_bought` must be less than `k`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer greater than the number of tickets bought and less than or equal to the minimum of n times m and 10^9, prices is a list of n positive integers, pq is a min-heap of tuples containing prices and their indices with one less element, total_cost is increased by the product of the price of the cheapest ticket and the number of tickets bought, tickets_bought is less than k, price_increase is increased by the number of tickets bought, the price of the cheapest ticket is increased by the price_increase value.**
