Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer less than or equal to the minimum of n times m and 10^9, prices is a list of n positive integers, pq is a min-heap of tuples containing prices and their indices, total_cost is 0, tickets_bought is 0, price_increase is 0**

In this output state, the initial state's information about n, m, k, and prices remains valid. The code introduces new variables: pq, total_cost, tickets_bought, and price_increase. The pq variable is a min-heap containing tuples of prices and their indices, which is created from the prices list. The total_cost, tickets_bought, and price_increase variables are initialized to 0.
