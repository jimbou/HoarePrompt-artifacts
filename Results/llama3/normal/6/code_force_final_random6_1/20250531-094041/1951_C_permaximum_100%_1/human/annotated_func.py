#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and k are positive integers, prices is a list of n positive integers, and k is less than or equal to the minimum of n times m and 10^9.

        price += price_increase
        
        tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)
        
        total_cost += price * tickets_to_buy

    #State: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer less than or equal to the minimum of n times m and 10^9, prices is a list of n positive integers, pq is a min-heap of tuples containing prices and their indices with k elements removed, total_cost is increased by the product of the price of the cheapest ticket and the number of tickets bought, tickets_bought is equal to k, price_increase is increased by the number of tickets bought, the price of the cheapest ticket is increased by the price_increase value.
    return total_cost
    #The program returns the total cost which is the sum of the products of the price of the cheapest ticket and the number of tickets bought, where the price of the cheapest ticket is increased by the price_increase value after each purchase, and the number of tickets bought is k, which is a positive integer less than or equal to the minimum of n times m and 10^9.

#Overall this is what the function does:Calculates the total cost of buying k tickets with increasing prices, where the price of the cheapest ticket is increased by the number of tickets bought after each purchase, and returns the total cost. The function takes in parameters n, m, k, and prices, and modifies the state of the program by removing k elements from the min-heap pq and updating the total_cost, tickets_bought, and price_increase variables.
