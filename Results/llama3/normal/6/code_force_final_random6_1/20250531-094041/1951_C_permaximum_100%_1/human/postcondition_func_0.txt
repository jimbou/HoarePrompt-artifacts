Calculates the total cost of buying k tickets with increasing prices, where the price of the cheapest ticket is increased by the number of tickets bought after each purchase, and returns the total cost. The function takes in parameters n, m, k, and prices, and modifies the state of the program by removing k elements from the min-heap pq and updating the total_cost, tickets_bought, and price_increase variables.
