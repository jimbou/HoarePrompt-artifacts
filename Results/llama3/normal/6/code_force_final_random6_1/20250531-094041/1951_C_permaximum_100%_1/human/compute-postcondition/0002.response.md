Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to the minimum of n times m and 10^9, prices is a list of n positive integers, pq is a min-heap of tuples containing prices and their indices with one less element, total_cost is increased by the product of the price of the cheapest ticket and the number of tickets bought, tickets_bought is increased by the number of tickets bought, price_increase is increased by the number of tickets bought, the price of the cheapest ticket is increased by the price_increase value.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The `pq` min-heap has one less element as the cheapest ticket is removed from the heap. The `total_cost` is increased by the product of the price of the cheapest ticket and the number of tickets bought, which is calculated as `price * tickets_to_buy`. The `tickets_bought` is increased by the number of tickets bought, which is the minimum of `m` and `k - tickets_bought`. The `price_increase` is increased by the number of tickets bought, which is the same as `tickets_to_buy`. The price of the cheapest ticket is increased by the `price_increase` value.
