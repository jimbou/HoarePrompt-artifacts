To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `tickets_bought < k`. The loop will execute if `tickets_bought` is less than `k`. Since `tickets_bought` is 0 and `k` is a positive integer less than or equal to the minimum of `n` times `m` and 10^9, we need to ensure that `k` is greater than 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to the minimum of `n` times `m` and 10^9, `prices` is a list of `n` positive integers, `pq` is a min-heap of tuples containing prices and their indices, `total_cost` is 0, `tickets_bought` is 0, `price_increase` is 0**
