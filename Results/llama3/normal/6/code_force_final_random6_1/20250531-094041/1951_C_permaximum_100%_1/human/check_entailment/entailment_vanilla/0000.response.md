Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum spending to purchase k tickets for a concert, considering the constraints of the problem.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1.  The program starts by reading the number of test cases (t) and then iterates over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the number of sale days (n), the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day (m), and the number of tickets to be bought (k).
3.  It then reads the prices of tickets for each day and stores them in the `prices` list.
4.  The program defines a function `func_1` that takes the parameters n, m, k, and prices as input.
5.  Inside `func_1`, it creates a priority queue (pq) using the `heapq` module, where each element is a tuple containing the price of a ticket and its corresponding day.
6.  The program then enters a while loop that continues until all k tickets have been bought.
7.  In each iteration of the loop, it pops the ticket with the lowest price from the priority queue, adds the current price increase to the price, and calculates the number of tickets to buy on the current day (which is the minimum of m and the remaining tickets to be bought).
8.  It then updates the total cost by adding the product of the price and the number of tickets bought, increments the tickets bought, and updates the price increase.
9.  Once all tickets have been bought, the function returns the total cost.
10. Finally, the program prints the result for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
