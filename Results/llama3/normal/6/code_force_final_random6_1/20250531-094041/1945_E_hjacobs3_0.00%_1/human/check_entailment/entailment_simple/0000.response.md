Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the binary search algorithm to find the target number x in the permutation p. The program first checks if the target number is at the correct position after the binary search. If not, it swaps the target number with the number at the correct position. The program then prints the number of operations performed (0 or 1) and the indices of the swapped numbers (if any).

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles the cases where the target number is already at the correct position or needs to be swapped with another number. The use of binary search reduces the time complexity of the program, making it efficient for large inputs.

Correctness: **True**
