The variables in the loop head are l and r, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables l and r. If l is less than or equal to r, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, l is updated to mid + 1 and r is updated to mid - 1 if array[mid] is greater than or equal to find, otherwise l is updated to mid + 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, l must be less than or equal to r. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` must be less than or equal to `r`.**
