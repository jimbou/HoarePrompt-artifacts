Output State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is 0, `r` is `mid` - 1, `mid` is the integer part of the average of `l` and `r`, and the current value of `array[mid]` is greater than or equal to `find`.**

In this output state, the value of `r` has been updated to `mid - 1`, which means the search space has been narrowed down to the left half of the original array. The other variables remain unchanged, and the relationship between `array[mid]` and `find` is still valid.
