Output State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` must be less than or equal to `mid - 1`, `mid` is the integer part of the average of `l` and `mid - 1`, `r` is `mid - 1`.**

In this output state, the value of `r` has been updated to `mid - 1`, which affects the relationship between `l` and `r`. Now, `l` must be less than or equal to `mid - 1`, and `mid` is still the integer part of the average of `l` and `r`, but `r` is now `mid - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
