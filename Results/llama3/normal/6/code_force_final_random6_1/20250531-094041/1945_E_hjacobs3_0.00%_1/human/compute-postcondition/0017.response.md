Postcondition: ***`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, and `mid` is the integer division of the sum of `l` and `r` by 2. If `array[mid]` is greater than or equal to `find`, then `r` is updated to `mid - 1` and `l` remains less than or equal to `mid - 1`. Otherwise, `l` is updated to `mid + 1` and `r` remains greater than or equal to `mid + 1`.***
