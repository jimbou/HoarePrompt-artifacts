The code snippet consists of three lines. The first line assigns the length of the array to the variable n. Since the array is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n, the length of the array is equal to n. Therefore, the value of n remains unchanged.

The second line assigns the value 0 to the variable l and the value n - 1 to the variable r. Since n is the length of the array, r becomes the index of the last element in the array.

The third line is a pass statement, which does not affect any variables.

After executing the entire code block, the output state is:

Output State: **array is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, find is an integer such that 1 <= find <= n, n is the length of array, l is 0, r is n - 1**
