Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the binary search algorithm to find the target value `x` in the permutation `p`. The program first checks if the target value is at the expected index after the binary search. If it is not, the program prints 1 and returns the indices of the expected position and the actual position of the target value. If the target value is at the expected index, the program prints 0.

The program correctly handles the case where the target value is not at the expected index by swapping the elements at the expected position and the actual position of the target value. This ensures that the binary search algorithm will find the target value at the expected index.

The program also correctly handles the case where the target value is at the expected index by printing 0 and not performing any swaps.

Therefore, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
