Output State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= find <= n, `n` is the length of array, `l` is mid + 1, `r` is n - 1, `mid` is the integer part of the average of `l` and `r`, and the value of `array[mid]` is less than `find`**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to `mid + 1`, while the other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `l`, `r`, and `mid` is still maintained, and the condition that the value of `array[mid]` is less than `find` is still true.
