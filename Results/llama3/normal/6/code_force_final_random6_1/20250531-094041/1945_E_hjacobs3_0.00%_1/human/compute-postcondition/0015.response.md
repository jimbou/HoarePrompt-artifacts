Output State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is less than or equal to `mid - 1`, `r` is equal to `mid - 1`, and `mid` is the integer division of the sum of `l` and `r` by 2.**

In this output state, the value of `r` has been updated to `mid - 1`, while the other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `l` and `r` has also been updated to reflect the new value of `r`.
