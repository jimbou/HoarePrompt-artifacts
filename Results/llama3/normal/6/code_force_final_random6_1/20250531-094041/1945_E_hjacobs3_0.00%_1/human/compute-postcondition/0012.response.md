Postcondition: ***`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`, `n` is the length of `array`. If `array[mid]` is greater than or equal to `find`, then `l` is less than or equal to `mid - 1`, `mid` is the integer part of the average of `l` and `mid - 1`, and `r` is `mid - 1`. Otherwise, `l` is equal to `mid + 1`, `mid` is the integer part of the average of `l` and `r`, and `r` is greater than or equal to `l`.***
