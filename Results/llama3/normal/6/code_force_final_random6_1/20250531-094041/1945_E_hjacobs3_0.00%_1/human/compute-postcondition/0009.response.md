Output State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` must be less than or equal to `r`, `mid` is the integer part of the average of `l` and `r`.**

In this output state, the value of `mid` is calculated as the integer part of the average of `l` and `r`, which means it is the middle index between `l` and `r`. The other variables remain unchanged, with `array` still being a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `find` being an integer between 1 and `n`, and `n` being the length of `array`. The relationship between `l` and `r` also remains the same, with `l` being less than or equal to `r`.
