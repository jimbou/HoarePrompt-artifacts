Output State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is equal to `mid + 1`, `mid` is the integer part of the average of `l` and `r`, `r` is greater than or equal to `l`**.

In natural language, the output state is: The list of integers, the value to be found, and the length of the list remain unchanged. The left boundary `l` is updated to be one more than the middle index `mid`, which is still the integer part of the average of the left and right boundaries. The right boundary `r` is still greater than or equal to the updated left boundary `l`.
