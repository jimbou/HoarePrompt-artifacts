Output State: **l is equal to r, and either array[l] is equal to find or array[l] is less than find and array[r] is greater than find.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the search space has been narrowed down to a single element, and either that element is the target value `find`, or it is not, but the element before it is less than `find` and the element after it is greater than `find`. This means that the loop has successfully found the target value or has determined that it is not present in the array.
