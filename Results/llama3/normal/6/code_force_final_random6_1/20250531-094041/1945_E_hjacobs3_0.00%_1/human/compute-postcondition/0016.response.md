Output State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is equal to `mid + 1`, `r` is greater than or equal to `mid + 1`, and `mid` is the integer division of the sum of `l` and `r` by 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of integers `array` remains unchanged, the value of `find` is still between 1 and `n`, and the length of `array` is still `n`. The left boundary `l` is now set to `mid + 1`, and the right boundary `r` is still greater than or equal to `mid + 1`. The midpoint `mid` is still the integer division of the sum of `l` and `r` by 2.
