To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `l` and `r` so that `l` is less than or equal to `r`. According to the code, if `array[mid]` is greater than or equal to `find`, then `l` is less than or equal to `mid - 1`, and `r` is `mid - 1`. Otherwise, `l` is equal to `mid + 1`, and `r` is greater than or equal to `l`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `l` is less than or equal to `mid - 1` or `l` is equal to `mid + 1`, and `r` is `mid - 1` or `r` is greater than or equal to `l`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `l` must be less than or equal to `r`. If `l` is less than or equal to `mid - 1`, then `r` must be greater than or equal to `l`. If `l` is equal to `mid + 1`, then `r` must be greater than or equal to `mid + 1`. 

So, the states need to be adjusted as follows: `l` is less than or equal to `r`, and `r` is greater than or equal to `l` if `l` is less than or equal to `mid - 1`, or `r` is greater than or equal to `mid + 1` if `l` is equal to `mid + 1`.

State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, and `r` is greater than or equal to `l` if `l` is less than or equal to `mid - 1`, or `r` is greater than or equal to `mid + 1` if `l` is equal to `mid + 1`.**
