Output State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `r` is greater than or equal to `l` if `l` is less than or equal to `mid - 1`, or `r` is greater than or equal to `mid + 1` if `l` is equal to `mid + 1`, and `mid` is the integer division of the sum of `l` and `r` by 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The array remains unchanged, the value of `find` is still between 1 and `n`, and `n` is still the length of the array. The relationship between `l` and `r` is still maintained, and a new variable `mid` is introduced, which is the average of `l` and `r`, rounded down to the nearest integer.
