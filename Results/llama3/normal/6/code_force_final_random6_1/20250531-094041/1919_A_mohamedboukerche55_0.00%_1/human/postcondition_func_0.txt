This function reads multiple lines of input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t, and each subsequent line contains two integers a and b. It then checks if the sum of a and b is even or odd and prints 'bob' if the sum is even and 'alice' if the sum is odd. The function repeats this process t times, consuming all input lines from stdin.
