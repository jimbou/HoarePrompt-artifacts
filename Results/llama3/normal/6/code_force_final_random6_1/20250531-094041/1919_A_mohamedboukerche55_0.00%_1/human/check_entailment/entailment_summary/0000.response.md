Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob, where they take turns exchanging wallets and removing coins. The game ends when one player cannot make a valid move. The provided program attempts to solve this problem by checking if the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even or odd.

The program's logic is based on the observation that if the sum of the coins is even, Bob will win, and if the sum is odd, Alice will win. This is because the game can be viewed as a sequence of moves where each player removes one coin from their wallet. If the sum of the coins is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring that he will have a valid move when Alice runs out of coins. Conversely, if the sum is odd, Alice can always make a move that will leave Bob with an even number of coins, forcing him to lose.

The program correctly implements this logic by reading the input, checking the parity of the sum of the coins, and printing the corresponding winner.

Correctness: **True**
