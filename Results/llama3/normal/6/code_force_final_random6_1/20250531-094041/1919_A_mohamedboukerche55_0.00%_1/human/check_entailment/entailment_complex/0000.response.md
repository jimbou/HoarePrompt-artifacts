Reasoning:

The problem statement describes a game where Alice and Bob take turns exchanging wallets and removing coins. The player who cannot make a valid move loses. The goal is to determine who will win the game if both players play optimally.

The provided Python program reads multiple lines of input, where each line contains two integers a and b representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. The program then checks if the sum of a and b is even or odd and prints 'bob' if the sum is even and 'alice' if the sum is odd.

The key insight here is that the game can be reduced to a simple parity check. If the sum of a and b is even, then Alice will always be forced to make a move that leaves Bob with an even number of coins, and vice versa. This means that Bob will always win if the sum is even, and Alice will always win if the sum is odd.

The program correctly implements this parity check and prints the correct winner based on the sum of a and b.

Correctness: **True**
