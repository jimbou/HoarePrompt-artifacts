The only objects in the loop head are variables  i and input(), so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input(). If the input() is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000). Each of the following t lines contains two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). So for the loop to be executed  the input() is at least 1 and i is 0.
State: **stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000). Each of the following t lines contains two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), i is 0, input() is at least 1**
