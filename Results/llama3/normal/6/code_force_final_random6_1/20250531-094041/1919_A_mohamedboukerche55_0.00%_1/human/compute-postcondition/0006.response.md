Output State: **i is t-1, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains 0 lines of input**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the loop counter `i` will be one less than the initial number of test cases `t`, the variables `a` and `b` will hold the values of the last pair of integers read from the input, and there will be no more lines left to read from the standard input.
