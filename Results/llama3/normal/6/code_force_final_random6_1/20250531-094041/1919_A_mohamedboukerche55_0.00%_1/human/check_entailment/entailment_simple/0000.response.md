Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob, who take turns exchanging wallets and removing coins. The game ends when a player cannot make a valid move. The solution provided uses a simple parity check to determine the winner.

The key insight is that the game can be viewed as a sequence of moves, where each move consists of exchanging wallets (if desired) and removing a coin. The parity of the total number of coins (a + b) determines the winner. If the sum is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

The provided program correctly implements this logic. It reads the input values for a and b, calculates the sum, and checks its parity using the modulo operator (%). If the sum is even, it prints "bob"; otherwise, it prints "alice".

The program's correctness can be verified by analyzing the possible scenarios:

1. If the sum of a and b is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring that he wins.
2. If the sum of a and b is odd, Alice can always make a move that leaves Bob with an even number of coins, forcing him to lose.

Since the program correctly implements the parity check and prints the corresponding winner, it is correct.

Correctness: **True**
