The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and input(). According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `input()`. If `i` is less than `input()`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `input()` is at least 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `input()` must be at least 1.
State: **`i` is 1, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines of input, `input()` is at least 1**
