Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements a binary search algorithm to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x.

The program first reads the number of vertices n and the number of edges to be removed k from the input. It then creates a Tree object with n vertices and adds edges to the tree based on the input.

The program then uses a binary search algorithm to find the maximum number x. It starts with a range [1, n] and repeatedly checks if it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree such that the size of each remaining connected component is at least the midpoint of the range. If it is possible, it updates the lower bound of the range to the midpoint. Otherwise, it updates the upper bound of the range to the midpoint minus one.

The program uses a recursive function func_1 to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the subtree rooted at a given vertex. It uses another recursive function func_2 to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the subtree rooted at a given vertex, but this function is not actually used in the program.

The program uses a function func_3 to check if it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree such that the size of each remaining connected component is at least a given number x. It uses a function func_4 to perform the binary search algorithm.

The program finally prints the result of the binary search algorithm, which is the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x.

Correctness: **True**
