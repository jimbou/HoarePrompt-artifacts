To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `beg` and `end` so that `beg` is still less than `end`.

According to the given state, if `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` is true, then `beg` is equal to `(n + 2) // 2` and `end` is greater than `(n + 2) // 2 - 1`. This means `end` is at least `(n + 2) // 2`, so `beg` is less than or equal to `end`. To ensure `beg` is less than `end`, we need to adjust `end` to be greater than `(n + 2) // 2`.

If `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` is false, then `beg` is less than `(n + 2) // 2` and `end` is equal to `(n + 2) // 2 - 1`. This means `beg` is less than `end`, so no adjustment is needed.

However, since we don't know the value of `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)`, we need to consider both cases. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `end` to be greater than `(n + 2) // 2` in the first case, and no adjustment is needed in the second case.

State: **`tree` is a tree data structure with `n` vertices, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k` < `n`. If `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` is true, then `beg` is equal to `(n + 2) // 2` and `end` is greater than `(n + 2) // 2`. Otherwise, `beg` is less than `(n + 2) // 2` and `end` is equal to `(n + 2) // 2 - 1**
