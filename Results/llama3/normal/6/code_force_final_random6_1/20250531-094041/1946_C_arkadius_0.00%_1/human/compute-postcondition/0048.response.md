Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with a vertices attribute that is a list of at least 1 Vertex object, `s` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= s < len(tree.vertices), `x` is a positive integer, `v` is equal to the value of the second last element in the stack and is a valid index for the tree's vertices, `postorder` is equal to the last element in the stack and its current value is True, `tree.vertices[v].children` is not empty and has been fully traversed, `u` is the first child in `tree.vertices[v].children`, and `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The tree object remains unchanged, the value of s and x remains the same, the value of v and postorder remains the same, the children of the vertex at index v in the tree have been fully traversed, and the good_components of the vertex at index v in the tree have been increased by the good_components of the first child of the vertex at index v.
