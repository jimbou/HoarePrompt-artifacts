You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: tree is a Tree object, v is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= v < len(tree.vertices), and x is a non-negative integer.
    good_components = 0
    remaining_size = 1
    for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
        good_components_subtree, remaining_size_subtree = func_2(tree, u, x)
        
        good_components += good_components_subtree
        
        if remaining_size_subtree >= x:
            good_components += 1
        else:
            remaining_size += remaining_size_subtree
        
    #State: tree is a Tree object, v is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= v < len(tree.vertices), x is a non-negative integer, good_components is a non-negative integer equal to its original value plus the sum of good_components_subtree for all children of tree.vertices[v], remaining_size is a non-negative integer equal to its original value plus the sum of remaining_size_subtree for all children of tree.vertices[v] where remaining_size_subtree is less than x.
    return good_components, remaining_size
    #The program returns a tuple containing two values: good_components and remaining_size. good_components is a non-negative integer equal to its original value plus the sum of good_components_subtree for all children of tree.vertices[v], where v is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= v < len(tree.vertices). remaining_size is a non-negative integer equal to its original value plus the sum of remaining_size_subtree for all children of tree.vertices[v] where remaining_size_subtree is less than x, and x is a non-negative integer.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a tuple containing two values: good_components and remaining_size. good_components is a non-negative integer equal to its original value plus the sum of good_components_subtree for all children of tree.vertices[v], where v is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= v < len(tree.vertices). remaining_size is a non-negative integer equal to its original value plus the sum of remaining_size_subtree for all children of tree.vertices[v] where remaining_size_subtree is less than x, and x is a non-negative integer.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
