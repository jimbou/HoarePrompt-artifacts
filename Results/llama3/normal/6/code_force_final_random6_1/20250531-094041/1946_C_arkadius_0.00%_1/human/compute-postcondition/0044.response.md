Output State: **tree** is a Tree object with a vertices attribute that is a list of Vertex objects, **s** is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= s < len(tree.vertices), **x** is a positive integer, **v** is equal to the value of the second last element in the stack, **postorder** is equal to the last element in the stack. If the last element in the stack is True, **tree.vertices[v].children** is not empty and has been fully traversed. For each child **u** in **tree.vertices[v].children**, if **tree.vertices[u].remaining_size** is greater than or equal to **x**, then **tree.vertices[v].good_components** has been increased by 1. Otherwise, **tree.vertices[v].good_components** has been increased by the value of **tree.vertices[u].good_components** and **tree.vertices[v].remaining_size** has been increased by the value of **tree.vertices[u].remaining_size**. If the last element in the stack is False, no changes are made. **stack** is not empty but has been reduced by one element and now contains the tuple (**v**, True) as its second last element and (**u**, False) as its last element, **tree.vertices[v].children** is a list of children that must have at least n children, **u** is the nth child in the list, and the stack now contains the tuple (**u**, False) as its last element and (**u**, False) has been appended to the stack.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the tree's vertices have been fully traversed, and for each child of the current vertex, if its remaining size is greater than or equal to x, the good components of the current vertex have been increased by 1. Otherwise, the good components of the current vertex have been increased by the value of the good components of the child and the remaining size of the current vertex has been increased by the value of the remaining size of the child. The stack now contains the tuple (u, False) as its last element, where u is the nth child in the list of children of the current vertex.
