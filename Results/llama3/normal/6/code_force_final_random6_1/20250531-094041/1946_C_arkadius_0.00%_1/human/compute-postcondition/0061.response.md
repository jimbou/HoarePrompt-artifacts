Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with a vertices attribute that is a list of at least 1 Vertex object, `s` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= s < len(tree.vertices), `x` is a positive integer, `v` is equal to the value of the second last element in the stack and is a valid index for the tree's vertices, `postorder` is equal to the last element in the stack and its current value is True, `tree.vertices[v].children` has at least one more child to iterate over after `u`, `u` is the next next child in `tree.vertices[v].children`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by 1 plus the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The tree object remains unchanged, the value of s and x remains the same, the value of v and postorder remains the same. The number of good components of the vertex at index v in the tree is increased by 1 plus the number of good components of the vertex at index u in the tree.
