Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with a vertices attribute that is a list of Vertex objects, `s` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= s < len(tree.vertices), `x` is a positive integer, `v` is equal to the value of the last element in the stack, `tree.vertices[v].children` has at least 3 children, `u` is the third child in `tree.vertices[v].children`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components`**

In natural language, the output state is: The tree object remains unchanged except for the good_components attribute of the vertex at index v, which is increased by the good_components value of the vertex at index u. The values of s, x, v, and the children of the vertex at index v remain the same.
