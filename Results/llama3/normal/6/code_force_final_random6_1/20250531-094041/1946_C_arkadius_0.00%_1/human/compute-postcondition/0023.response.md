Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with a vertices attribute that is a list of Vertex objects, `s` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= s < len(tree.vertices), `x` is a positive integer, `v` is equal to s, `postorder` is True, `tree.vertices[v].children` is not empty and has at least 2 children, `u` is the second child in the list, and `tree.vertices[v].good_components` has been increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The tree object and its vertices remain unchanged, the values of s, x, v, and postorder remain the same, and the children of the vertex at index v are still not empty and have at least 2 children. The second child in the list is still u. However, the good_components attribute of the vertex at index v has been incremented by the good_components value of the vertex at index u.
