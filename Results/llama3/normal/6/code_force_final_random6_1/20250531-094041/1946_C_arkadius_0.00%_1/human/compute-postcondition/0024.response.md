Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with a vertices attribute that is a list of Vertex objects, `s` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= s < len(tree.vertices), `x` is a positive integer, `v` is equal to s, `postorder` is True, `tree.vertices[v].children` is not empty and has at least 2 children, `u` is the second child in the list, and `tree.vertices[v].good_components` has been increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `tree.vertices[v].good_components` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The `tree` object and its attributes, including the `vertices` list and the `children` list of each vertex, are still the same. The values of `s`, `x`, `v`, `postorder`, and `u` are also unchanged.
