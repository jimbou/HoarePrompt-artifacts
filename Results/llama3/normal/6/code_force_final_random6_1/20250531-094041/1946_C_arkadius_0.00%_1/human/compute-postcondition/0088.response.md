Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with a vertices attribute that is a list of Vertex objects, `s` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= s < len(tree.vertices), `x` is a positive integer, `v` is equal to the value of the last element in the stack. If the second last element in the stack is False, no changes are made. If the second last element in the stack is True, `tree.vertices[v].children` is not empty and has at least 2 children, `u` is the second child in `tree.vertices[v].children`, postorder is True. `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The tree object remains unchanged, the value of s and x also remains the same. The value of v is still equal to the last element in the stack. If the second last element in the stack is False, no changes are made. If the second last element in the stack is True, the number of good components in the vertex v is increased by 1.
