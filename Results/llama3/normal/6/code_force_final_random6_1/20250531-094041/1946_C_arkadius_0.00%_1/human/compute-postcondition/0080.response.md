Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with a vertices attribute that is a list of Vertex objects, `s` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= s < len(tree.vertices), `x` is a positive integer, `v` is equal to the value of the last element in the stack. If the second last element in the stack is False, no changes are made. If the second last element in the stack is True, `tree.vertices[v].children` is not empty, `u` is the first child in `tree.vertices[v].children`, postorder is True, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components`**

In this output state, the value of `tree.vertices[v].good_components` has been updated by adding the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components` to it. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
