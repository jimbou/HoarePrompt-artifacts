Postcondition: ***`tree` is a Tree object with a vertices attribute that is a list of Vertex objects, `s` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= s < len(tree.vertices), `x` is a positive integer, `v` is equal to the value of the second last element in the stack, `postorder` is equal to the last element in the stack and its current value is True. `tree.vertices[v].children` is not empty and has been fully traversed. For each child `u` in `tree.vertices[v].children`, if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components` has been increased by 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` has been increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components` and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` has been increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.***
