Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: tree is a tree data structure with n vertices, n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer such that k < n, beg is 1, end is n
Code of the loop:
while beg < end:
    mid = (beg + end + 1) // 2
    if func_3(tree, n, k, mid):
        beg = mid
    else:
        end = mid - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`tree` is a tree data structure with `n` vertices, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k` < `n`. If `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returns True, then `beg` is updated to (`n` + 2) // 2 and `end` remains `n`. Otherwise, `beg` remains 1 and `end` is updated to (`n` + 2) // 2 - 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`tree` is a tree data structure with `n` vertices, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k` < `n`. If `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` is true, then `beg` is equal to `(n + 2) // 2` and `end` is greater than `(n + 2) // 2 - 1`. Otherwise, `beg` is less than `(n + 2) // 2` and `end` is equal to `(n + 2) // 2 - 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `tree` is a tree data structure with `n` vertices, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k` < `n`, `mid` is equal to the average of `beg` and `end` rounded up to the nearest integer. If `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` is true, then either `beg` is equal to `mid` and `end` is greater than `(n + 2) // 2`, or `beg` is equal to `(n + 2) // 2` and `end` is equal to `mid - 1` which is less than `(n + 2) // 2`. Otherwise, either `beg` is less than `(n + 2) // 2` and `end` is equal to `(n + 2) // 2 - 1`, or `beg` is less than `(n + 2) // 2` and `end` is equal to `mid - 1` which is less than `(n + 2) // 2`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
