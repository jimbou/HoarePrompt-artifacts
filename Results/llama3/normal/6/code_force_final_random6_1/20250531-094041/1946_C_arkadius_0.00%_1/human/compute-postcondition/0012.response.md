Postcondition: ***`tree` is a tree data structure with `n` vertices, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k` < `n`. If `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` is true, then `beg` is equal to `(n + 2) // 2` and `end` is greater than `(n + 2) // 2 - 1`. Otherwise, `beg` is less than `(n + 2) // 2` and `end` is equal to `(n + 2) // 2 - 1`.***
