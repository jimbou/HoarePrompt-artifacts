Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with a vertices attribute that is a list of Vertex objects, `s` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= s < len(tree.vertices), `x` is a positive integer, `v` is equal to the value of the last element in the stack. If the second last element in the stack is False, no changes are made. If the second last element in the stack is True, `tree.vertices[v].children` is not empty and has at least 2 children, `u` is the second child in `tree.vertices[v].children`, postorder is True. `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components` and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`**

In this output state, the values of `tree`, `s`, `x`, and `v` remain unchanged. The second last element in the stack being True or False does not change. If it is True, `tree.vertices[v].children` still has at least 2 children and `u` is still the second child in `tree.vertices[v].children`. The value of `postorder` is still True. The only change is that `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.
