Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tree` is a Tree object with a vertices attribute that is a list of Vertex objects, `s` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= s < len(tree.vertices), `x` is a positive integer, `v` is equal to the value of the second last element in the stack, `postorder` is equal to the last element in the stack. If the last element in the stack is True, `tree.vertices[v].children` is not empty and has been fully traversed. For each child `u` in `tree.vertices[v].children`, if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components` has been increased by 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` has been increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components` and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` has been increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`. If the last element in the stack is False, no changes are made. `stack` is not empty but has been reduced by one element and now contains the tuple `(v, True)` as its last element.
Code of the loop:
for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
    stack.append((u, False))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tree` is a Tree object with a vertices attribute that is a list of Vertex objects, `s` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= s < len(tree.vertices), `x` is a positive integer, `v` is equal to the value of the second last element in the stack, `postorder` is equal to the last element in the stack. If the last element in the stack is True, `tree.vertices[v].children` is not empty and has been fully traversed. For each child `u` in `tree.vertices[v].children`, if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components` has been increased by 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` has been increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components` and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` has been increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`. If the last element in the stack is False, no changes are made. `stack` is not empty but has been reduced by one element and now contains the tuple `(v, True)` as its second last element and `(u, False)` as its last element, `tree.vertices[v].children` is a list of children that must have at least 1 child, `u` is the first child in the list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tree` is a Tree object with a vertices attribute that is a list of Vertex objects, `s` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= s < len(tree.vertices), `x` is a positive integer, `v` is equal to the value of the second last element in the stack, `postorder` is equal to the last element in the stack. If the last element in the stack is True, `tree.vertices[v].children` is not empty and has been fully traversed. For each child `u` in `tree.vertices[v].children`, if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components` has been increased by 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` has been increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components` and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` has been increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`. If the last element in the stack is False, no changes are made. `stack` is not empty but has been reduced by one element and now contains the tuple `(v, True)` as its second last element and `(u, False)` as its last element, `tree.vertices[v].children` is a list of children that must have at least 2 children, `u` is the second child in the list, and the stack now contains the tuple `(u, False)` as its last element.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `tree` is a Tree object with a vertices attribute that is a list of Vertex objects, `s` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= s < len(tree.vertices), `x` is a positive integer, `v` is equal to the value of the second last element in the stack, `postorder` is equal to the last element in the stack. If the last element in the stack is True, `tree.vertices[v].children` is not empty and has been fully traversed. For each child `u` in `tree.vertices[v].children`, if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components` has been increased by 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` has been increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components` and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` has been increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`. If the last element in the stack is False, no changes are made. `stack` is not empty but has been reduced by one element and now contains the tuple `(v, True)` as its second last element and `(u, False)` as its last element, `tree.vertices[v].children` is a list of children that must have at least 3 children, `u` is the third child in the list, and the stack now contains the tuple `(u, False)` as its last element and `(u, False)` has been appended to the stack.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
