The only objects in the loop head are variables  u and tree.vertices[v].children, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the tree.vertices[v].children.  If the list has at least 2 children the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, tree.vertices[v].children has at least 1 child, u is the first child in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 children and the u is the second child in the list.
State: **`tree` is a Tree object with a vertices attribute that is a list of Vertex objects, `s` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= s < len(tree.vertices), `x` is a positive integer, `v` is equal to s, `postorder` is True, `tree.vertices[v].children` is not empty and has at least 2 children, `u` is the second child in the list.**
