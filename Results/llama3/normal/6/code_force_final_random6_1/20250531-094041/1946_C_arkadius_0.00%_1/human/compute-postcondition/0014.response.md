Output State: **`tree` is a tree data structure with `n` vertices, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k` < `n`, `mid` is equal to the average of `beg` and `end` rounded up to the nearest integer, if `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` is true, then `beg` is equal to `(n + 2) // 2` and `end` is greater than `(n + 2) // 2`. Otherwise, `beg` is less than `(n + 2) // 2` and `end` is equal to `(n + 2) // 2 - 1**

In this output state, the value of `mid` is calculated as the average of `beg` and `end` rounded up to the nearest integer. The values of `tree`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. The relationship between `beg` and `end` is still dependent on the value of `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)`, but now `mid` has a specific value that can be used in the function call.
