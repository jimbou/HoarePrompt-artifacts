Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with a vertices attribute that is a list of Vertex objects, `s` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= s < len(tree.vertices), `x` is a positive integer, `v` is equal to the value of the last element in the stack. If the second last element in the stack is False, no changes are made. If the second last element in the stack is True, `tree.vertices[v].children` is not empty, `u` is the first child in `tree.vertices[v].children`, postorder is True, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by 1, The current value of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`**

In natural language, the output state is: The tree object and its vertices remain unchanged. The value of s and x also remain the same. The value of v is still equal to the last element in the stack. If the second last element in the stack is False, no changes are made. If the second last element in the stack is True, the children of the vertex at index v in the tree's vertices are not empty, and the first child is denoted as u. The postorder traversal is still True. The good_components of the vertex at index v in the tree's vertices is increased by 1. The remaining_size of the vertex u is still greater than or equal to x.
