Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is a solution to the problem of finding the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from a tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x.

The program uses a binary search approach to find the maximum value of x. It starts by initializing the search range to [1, n] and then iteratively checks if it is possible to remove exactly k edges to get components of size at least mid. If it is possible, it updates the lower bound of the search range to mid + 1. Otherwise, it updates the upper bound to mid - 1.

The program uses a recursive function func_2 to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the subtree rooted at a given vertex. It also uses a non-recursive function func_1 to calculate the same values for the entire tree.

The program correctly handles the case where the number of good components is equal to k and the remaining size is greater than or equal to x. It also correctly handles the case where the number of good components is greater than k.

The program does not have any obvious errors or edge cases that it does not handle correctly. It correctly implements the binary search approach and the recursive and non-recursive functions to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the subtree.

Therefore, based on the provided code and the problem description, the program appears to be correct.
