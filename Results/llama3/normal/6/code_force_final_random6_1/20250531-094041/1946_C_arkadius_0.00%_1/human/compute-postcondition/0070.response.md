Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with a vertices attribute that is a list of Vertex objects, `s` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= s < len(tree.vertices), `x` is a positive integer, `v` is equal to the value of the second last element in the stack, the last element in the stack is (u, False), the second last element in the stack is (v, True), `tree.vertices[v].children` has at least 1 child and has been fully traversed, for each child `u` in `tree.vertices[v].children`, if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components` has been increased by 1, otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` has been increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components` and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` has been increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size, u is the first child in tree.vertices[v].children**

In this output state, the stack has been increased by one element with value (u, False), and the value of v has been updated to be the second last element in the stack. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
