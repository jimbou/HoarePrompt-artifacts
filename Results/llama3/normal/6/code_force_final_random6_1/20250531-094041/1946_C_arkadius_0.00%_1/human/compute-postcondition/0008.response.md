Output State: **An error occurs due to attempting to read from an empty stdin, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `k` is a positive integer less than `n`, `tree` is a Tree object with `n` nodes, and it has additional edges between nodes `u-1` and `v-1` for all inputs read from stdin, and the root of the tree is set to node 0 with parent -1.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `i`, `k`, and `tree` remain unchanged. The `tree` object still has `n` nodes and additional edges between nodes `u-1` and `v-1` for all inputs read from stdin. However, the `root_tree_non_recursive` method is called on the `tree` object, setting the root of the tree to node 0 with parent -1. The error due to attempting to read from an empty stdin still occurs.
