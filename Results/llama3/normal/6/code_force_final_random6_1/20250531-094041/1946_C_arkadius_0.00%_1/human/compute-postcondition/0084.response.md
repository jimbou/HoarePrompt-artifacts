Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with a vertices attribute that is a list of Vertex objects, `s` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= s < len(tree.vertices), `x` is a positive integer, `v` is equal to the value of the last element in the stack. If the second last element in the stack is False, no changes are made. If the second last element in the stack is True, `tree.vertices[v].children` is not empty, `u` is the first child in `tree.vertices[v].children`, postorder is True, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components`, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`, and the remaining size of the first child of the last vertex in the stack is less than `x`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but with the additional change that `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` has been increased by `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`. This change only occurs if the second last element in the stack is True, and if `tree.vertices[v].children` is not empty. The values of the other variables remain the same.
