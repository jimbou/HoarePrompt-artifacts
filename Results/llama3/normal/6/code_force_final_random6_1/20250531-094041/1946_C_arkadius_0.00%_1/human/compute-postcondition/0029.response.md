Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with a vertices attribute that is a list of Vertex objects, `s` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= s < len(tree.vertices), `x` is a positive integer, `v` is equal to s, `postorder` is True, `tree.vertices[v].children` is not empty and has at least 3 children, `u` is the third child in the list, and `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The tree object and its vertices, the non-negative integer s, the positive integer x, the value of v which is equal to s, the boolean postorder, the children of the vertex v, and the third child u in the list of children remain unchanged. The only change is that the good_components attribute of the vertex v is increased by 1.
