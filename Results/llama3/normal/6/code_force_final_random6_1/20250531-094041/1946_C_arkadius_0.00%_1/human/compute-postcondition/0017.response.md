Postcondition: **`tree` is a tree data structure with `n` vertices, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k` < `n`, `mid` is equal to the average of `beg` and `end` rounded up to the nearest integer. If `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` is true, then either `beg` is equal to `mid` and `end` is greater than `(n + 2) // 2`, or `beg` is equal to `(n + 2) // 2` and `end` is equal to `mid - 1` which is less than `(n + 2) // 2`. Otherwise, either `beg` is less than `(n + 2) // 2` and `end` is equal to `(n + 2) // 2 - 1`, or `beg` is less than `(n + 2) // 2` and `end` is equal to `mid - 1` which is less than `(n + 2) // 2`.**
