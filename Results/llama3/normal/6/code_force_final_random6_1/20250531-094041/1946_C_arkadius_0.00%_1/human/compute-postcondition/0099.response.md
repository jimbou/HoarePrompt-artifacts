Output State: **The program returns a tuple containing the total number of good components in the subtree rooted at tree.vertices[s] and the total remaining size of the subtree rooted at tree.vertices[s].**

In this output state, the first element of the tuple is the total number of good components in the subtree rooted at tree.vertices[s], which is a non-negative integer. The second element of the tuple is the total remaining size of the subtree rooted at tree.vertices[s], which is also a non-negative integer.
