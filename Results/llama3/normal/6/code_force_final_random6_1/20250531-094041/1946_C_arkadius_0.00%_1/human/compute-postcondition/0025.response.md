Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with a vertices attribute that is a list of Vertex objects, `s` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= s < len(tree.vertices), `x` is a positive integer, `v` is equal to s, `postorder` is True, `tree.vertices[v].children` is not empty and has at least 2 children, `u` is the second child in the list, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` has been increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components`, and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` has been increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The tree object and its attributes remain unchanged except for the remaining size of the vertex at index v, which has been increased by the remaining size of the vertex at index u. All other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
