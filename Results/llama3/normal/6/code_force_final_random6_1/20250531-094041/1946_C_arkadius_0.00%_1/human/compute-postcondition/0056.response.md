Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with a vertices attribute that is a list of at least 1 Vertex object, `s` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= s < len(tree.vertices), `x` is a positive integer, `v` is equal to the value of the second last element in the stack and is a valid index for the tree's vertices, `postorder` is equal to the last element in the stack and its current value is True, `tree.vertices[v].children` is not empty and has at least one more child to iterate over, `u` is the next child in `tree.vertices[v].children`, and `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The tree object remains unchanged, the value of s remains the same, x is still a positive integer, v is still equal to the second last element in the stack, postorder is still True, the children of the vertex at index v in the tree still have at least one more child to iterate over, and u is still the next child in the children of the vertex at index v. The only change is that the good_components attribute of the vertex at index v in the tree is increased by 1.
