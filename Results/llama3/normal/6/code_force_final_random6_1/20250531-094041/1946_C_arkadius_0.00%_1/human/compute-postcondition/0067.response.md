Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with a vertices attribute that is a list of Vertex objects, `s` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= s < len(tree.vertices), `x` is a positive integer, `v` is equal to the value of the last element in the stack. If the second last element in the stack is False, no changes are made. If the second last element in the stack is True, `tree.vertices[v].children` has been fully traversed. For each child `u` in `tree.vertices[v].children`, if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components` has been increased by 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` has been increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components` and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` has been increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size, stack has been reduced by one element**.

In this output state, the value of `v` has been updated to the value of the last element in the stack, and the value of `postorder` has been assigned the value of the second last element in the stack. The stack has been reduced by one element. The other variables remain unchanged.
