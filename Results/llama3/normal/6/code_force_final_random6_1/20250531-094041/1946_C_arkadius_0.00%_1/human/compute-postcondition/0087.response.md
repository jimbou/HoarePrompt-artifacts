Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with a vertices attribute that is a list of Vertex objects, `s` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= s < len(tree.vertices), `x` is a positive integer, `v` is equal to the value of the last element in the stack. If the second last element in the stack is False, no changes are made. If the second last element in the stack is True, `tree.vertices[v].children` is not empty and has at least 2 children, `u` is the second child in `tree.vertices[v].children`, postorder is True. `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components`**.

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `tree.vertices[v].good_components` has been increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components`. The other variables remain unchanged.
