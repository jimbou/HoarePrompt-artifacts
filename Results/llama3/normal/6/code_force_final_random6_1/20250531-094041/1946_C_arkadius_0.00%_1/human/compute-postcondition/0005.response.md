The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **An error occurs due to attempting to read from an empty stdin, n is at least 3, i is 3, k is a positive integer less than n, tree is a Tree object with n nodes, and it has an additional edge between nodes u-1 and v-1**
