Output State: **`tree` is a tree data structure with `n` vertices, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k` < `n`, `mid` is equal to the average of `beg` and `end` rounded up to the nearest integer, if `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` is true, then `beg` is equal to `(n + 2) // 2` and `end` is equal to `mid - 1` which is less than `(n + 2) // 2`, otherwise, `beg` is less than `(n + 2) // 2` and `end` is equal to `mid - 1` which is less than `(n + 2) // 2`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The tree data structure and the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. The value of `mid` is still the average of `beg` and `end` rounded up to the nearest integer. However, the value of `end` has been updated to `mid - 1`, which is less than `(n + 2) // 2`. The relationship between `beg` and `end` has changed, but the condition `if func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` is true still holds.
