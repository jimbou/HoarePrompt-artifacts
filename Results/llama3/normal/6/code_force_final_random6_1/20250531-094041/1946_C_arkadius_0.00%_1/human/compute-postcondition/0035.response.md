Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with a vertices attribute that is a list of Vertex objects, `s` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= s < len(tree.vertices), `x` is a positive integer, `v` is equal to the value of the second last element in the stack, `postorder` is equal to the last element in the stack. If the last element in the stack is True, `tree.vertices[v].children` is not empty and has been fully traversed. For each child `u` in `tree.vertices[v].children`, if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components` has been increased by 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` has been increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components` and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` has been increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`. If the last element in the stack is False, no changes are made. `stack` is not empty but has been reduced by one element.**

In this output state, the values of `tree`, `s`, and `x` remain unchanged. The value of `v` is now equal to the second last element in the stack, and the value of `postorder` is equal to the last element in the stack. The state of `tree.vertices[v].children` and the updates to `tree.vertices[v].good_components` and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` depend on the value of `postorder`. The stack has been reduced by one element, but it is still not empty.
