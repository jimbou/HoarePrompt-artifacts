Postcondition: ***`tree` is a Tree object with a vertices attribute that is a list of Vertex objects, `s` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= s < len(tree.vertices), `x` is a positive integer, `v` is equal to the value of the last element in the stack, `tree.vertices[v].children` has at least 3 children, `u` is the third child in `tree.vertices[v].children`. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components` and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`***
