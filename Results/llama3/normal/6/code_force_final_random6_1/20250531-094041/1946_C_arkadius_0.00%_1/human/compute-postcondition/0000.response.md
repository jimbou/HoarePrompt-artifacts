Output State: **n and k are positive integers such that k < n, tree is a Tree object with n nodes**.

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` are updated to the input values, and a new `Tree` object is created with `n` nodes. The previous values of `n` and `k` are overwritten by the input values, and the `tree` variable is assigned a new object. The relationship between `n` and `k` is maintained, with `k` still being less than `n`.
