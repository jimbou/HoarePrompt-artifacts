Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with a vertices attribute that is a list of Vertex objects, `s` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= s < len(tree.vertices), `x` is a positive integer, `v` is equal to the value of the last element in the stack, `tree.vertices[v].children` has at least 3 children, `u` is the third child in `tree.vertices[v].children`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components`, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`**.

In natural language, the output state is: The tree object remains unchanged, the value of s remains a non-negative integer less than the length of the tree's vertices, the value of x remains a positive integer, the value of v remains the last element in the stack, the children of the vertex at index v in the tree's vertices remain the same with at least 3 children, the value of u remains the third child in the children of the vertex at index v, the good components of the vertex at index v are increased by the good components of the vertex at index u, and the remaining size of the vertex at index v is increased by the remaining size of the vertex at index u.
