Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with a vertices attribute that is a list of Vertex objects, `s` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= s < len(tree.vertices), `x` is a positive integer, `v` is equal to the value of the last element in the stack. If the second last element in the stack is False, no changes are made. If the second last element in the stack is True, `tree.vertices[v].children` has been fully traversed. For each child `u` in `tree.vertices[v].children`, if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components` has been increased by 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` has been increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components` and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` has been increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size, stack has been reduced by one element. postorder is True**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations means that the loop has iterated over all children of the vertex `v` in the tree. For each child `u`, if the remaining size of `u` is greater than or equal to `x`, the good components of `v` are increased by 1. Otherwise, the good components of `v` are increased by the good components of `u`, and the remaining size of `v` is increased by the remaining size of `u`. The stack has been reduced by one element, and the postorder traversal is complete.
