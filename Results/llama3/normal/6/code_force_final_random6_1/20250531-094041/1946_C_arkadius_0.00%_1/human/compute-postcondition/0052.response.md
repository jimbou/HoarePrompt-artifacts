Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with a vertices attribute that is a list of at least 1 Vertex object, `s` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= s < len(tree.vertices), `x` is a positive integer, `v` is equal to the value of the second last element in the stack and is a valid index for the tree's vertices, `postorder` is equal to the last element in the stack and its current value is True, `tree.vertices[v].children` is not empty and has been fully traversed, `u` is the first child in `tree.vertices[v].children`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components`, and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`. The remaining size of `tree.vertices[u]` is less than `x`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` has been increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
