Output State: **n is at least 2, i is 1, k is a positive integer less than n, tree is a Tree object with n nodes, and it has an additional edge between nodes u-1 and v-1, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The `tree` object, however, is updated with an additional edge between the nodes `u-1` and `v-1`, where `u` and `v` are the integer values obtained from the input. After the execution of the code, the stdin is empty as it has been used to obtain the input values.
