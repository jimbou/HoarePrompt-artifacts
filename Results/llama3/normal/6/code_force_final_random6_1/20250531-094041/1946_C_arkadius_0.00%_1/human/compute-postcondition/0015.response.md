Output State: **`tree` is a tree data structure with `n` vertices, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k` < `n`, `mid` is equal to the average of `beg` and `end` rounded up to the nearest integer, `beg` is equal to `mid`, if `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` is true, then `end` is greater than `(n + 2) // 2`. Otherwise, `end` is equal to `(n + 2) // 2 - 1**

In this output state, the value of `beg` has been updated to be equal to `mid`, which is the average of the original `beg` and `end` rounded up to the nearest integer. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions related to `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` still apply.
