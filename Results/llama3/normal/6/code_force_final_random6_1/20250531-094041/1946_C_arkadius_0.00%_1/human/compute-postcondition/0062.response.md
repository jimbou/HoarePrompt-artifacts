Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with a vertices attribute that is a list of at least 1 Vertex object, `s` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= s < len(tree.vertices), `x` is a positive integer, `v` is equal to the value of the second last element in the stack and is a valid index for the tree's vertices, `postorder` is equal to the last element in the stack and its current value is True, `tree.vertices[v].children` has at least one more child to iterate over after `u`, `u` is the next next child in `tree.vertices[v].children`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components`, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The tree object and its vertices remain unchanged. The values of `s`, `x`, `v`, and `postorder` also remain the same. The `tree.vertices[v].children` still has at least one more child to iterate over after `u`, and `u` is still the next next child in `tree.vertices[v].children`. The `tree.vertices[v].good_components` has been increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components`, and now `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` has also been increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.
