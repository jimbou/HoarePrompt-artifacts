Functionality: **This function calculates the number of good components and the remaining size in a tree structure. It takes a Tree object, a non-negative integer v representing a vertex in the tree, and a non-negative integer x as input. The function recursively traverses the tree, starting from the given vertex, and counts the number of good components (subtrees with a size greater than or equal to x) and the remaining size (the sum of sizes of subtrees with a size less than x). The function returns a tuple containing the total number of good components and the total remaining size.**
