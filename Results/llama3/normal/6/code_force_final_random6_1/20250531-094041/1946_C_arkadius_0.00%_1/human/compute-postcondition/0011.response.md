Functionality: **The function constructs a tree with a specified number of nodes, adds edges between nodes based on input, and then applies the func_4 function to the tree, returning the result. The function expects two positive integers, n and k, where k is less than n, and uses them to create and manipulate the tree. The final state of the program is the output of the func_4 function applied to the constructed tree, the number of nodes, and the value of k.**
