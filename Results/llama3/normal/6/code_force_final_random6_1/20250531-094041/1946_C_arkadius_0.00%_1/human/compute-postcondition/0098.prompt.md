Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: tree is a Tree object with a vertices attribute that is a list of Vertex objects, s is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= s < len(tree.vertices), x is a positive integer, and stack is a list containing a tuple with s and False as its elements.
Code of the loop:
while stack:
    v, postorder = stack.pop()
    if not postorder:
        stack.append((v, True))
        for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
            stack.append((u, False))
    if postorder:
        for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
            tree.vertices[v].good_components += tree.vertices[u
                ].good_components
            if tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x:
                tree.vertices[v].good_components += 1
            else:
                tree.vertices[v].remaining_size += tree.vertices[u
                    ].remaining_size


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *tree is a Tree object with a vertices attribute that is a list of Vertex objects, s is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= s < len(tree.vertices), x is a positive integer, v is equal to s. If postorder is True, tree.vertices[v].children is not empty and has been fully traversed. For each child u in tree.vertices[v].children, if tree.vertices[u].remaining_size is greater than or equal to x, then tree.vertices[v].good_components has been increased by 1. Otherwise, tree.vertices[v].good_components has been increased by the value of tree.vertices[u].good_components and tree.vertices[v].remaining_size has been increased by the value of tree.vertices[u].remaining_size. If postorder is False, no changes are made.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`tree` is a Tree object with a vertices attribute that is a list of Vertex objects, `s` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= s < len(tree.vertices), `x` is a positive integer, `v` is equal to the value of the second last element in the stack. If the last element in the stack is False, no changes are made. If the last element in the stack is True, `tree.vertices[v].children` has been fully traversed. For each child `u` in `tree.vertices[v].children`, if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components` has been increased by 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` has been increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components` and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` has been increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`tree` is a Tree object with a vertices attribute that is a list of Vertex objects, `s` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= s < len(tree.vertices), `x` is a positive integer, `v` is equal to the value of the last element in the stack. If the second last element in the stack is False, no changes are made. If the second last element in the stack is True, `tree.vertices[v].children` has been fully traversed. For each child `u` in `tree.vertices[v].children`, if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components` has been increased by 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` has been increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components` and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` has been increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size, stack has been reduced by one element. If postorder is True, the above changes are made. If postorder is False, no changes are made.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
