Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from a tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x.

The program uses a binary search approach to find the maximum value of x. It starts by initializing the search range to [1, n], where n is the number of vertices in the tree.

The program then defines several functions to perform the following tasks:

- `func_1`: This function performs a depth-first search (DFS) on the tree and calculates the number of good components (i.e., components with a size greater than or equal to x) and the remaining size of the tree.
- `func_2`: This function is a recursive version of `func_1`. It calculates the number of good components and the remaining size of the subtree rooted at a given vertex.
- `func_3`: This function checks if it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree such that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x.
- `func_4`: This function performs a binary search to find the maximum value of x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree.
- `func_5`: This function reads the input, constructs the tree, and calls `func_4` to find the maximum value of x.

The program uses a `Tree` class to represent the tree, which has methods to add edges and perform a root tree non-recursively.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
