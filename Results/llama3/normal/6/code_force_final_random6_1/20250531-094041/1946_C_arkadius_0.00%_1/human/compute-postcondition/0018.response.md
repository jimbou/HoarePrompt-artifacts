Output State: **`tree` is a tree data structure with `n` vertices, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k` < `n`, `beg` is equal to `end`.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the tree data structure remains unchanged with `n` vertices, and `n` is still a positive integer. The value of `k` also remains the same, a non-negative integer less than `n`. The loop variables `beg` and `end` will eventually become equal, indicating that the loop has converged to a specific value.
