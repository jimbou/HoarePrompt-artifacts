Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`tree` is a Tree object with a vertices attribute that is a list of Vertex objects, `s` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= s < len(tree.vertices), `x` is a positive integer, `v` is equal to the value of the second last element in the stack, `postorder` is equal to the last element in the stack and its current value is True. `tree.vertices[v].children` is not empty and has been fully traversed. For each child `u` in `tree.vertices[v].children`, if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components` has been increased by 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` has been increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components` and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` has been increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.
Code of the loop:
for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
    tree.vertices[v].good_components += tree.vertices[u].good_components
    if tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x:
        tree.vertices[v].good_components += 1
    else:
        tree.vertices[v].remaining_size += tree.vertices[u].remaining_size


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`tree` is a Tree object with a vertices attribute that is a list of at least 1 Vertex object, `s` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= s < len(tree.vertices), `x` is a positive integer, `v` is equal to the value of the second last element in the stack and is a valid index for the tree's vertices, `postorder` is equal to the last element in the stack and its current value is True, `tree.vertices[v].children` is not empty and has been fully traversed, `u` is the first child in `tree.vertices[v].children`. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components` and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tree` is a Tree object with a vertices attribute that is a list of at least 1 Vertex object, `s` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= s < len(tree.vertices), `x` is a positive integer, `v` is equal to the value of the second last element in the stack and is a valid index for the tree's vertices, `postorder` is equal to the last element in the stack and its current value is True, `tree.vertices[v].children` is not empty and has at least one more child to iterate over, `u` is the next child in `tree.vertices[v].children`. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components` and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`tree` is a Tree object with a vertices attribute that is a list of at least 1 Vertex object, `s` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= s < len(tree.vertices), `x` is a positive integer, `v` is equal to the value of the second last element in the stack and is a valid index for the tree's vertices, `postorder` is equal to the last element in the stack and its current value is True, `tree.vertices[v].children` has at least one more child to iterate over after `u`, `u` is the next next child in `tree.vertices[v].children`. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by 1 plus the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components`. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components` and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
