Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with a vertices attribute that is a list of Vertex objects, `s` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= s < len(tree.vertices), `x` is a positive integer, `v` is equal to the value of the last element in the stack, the second last element in the stack is True, `tree.vertices[v].children` has been fully traversed, for each child `u` in `tree.vertices[v].children`, if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components` has been increased by 1, otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` has been increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components` and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` has been increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size, stack has been increased by one element with value (v, True)**

In natural language, the output state is: The tree object and its vertices remain unchanged. The value of s and x also remains the same. The value of v is still equal to the last element in the stack. The second last element in the stack is still True. The children of the vertex v have been fully traversed. The good components and remaining size of vertex v have been updated based on the remaining size of its children and the value of x. The stack has been increased by one element with the value (v, True).
