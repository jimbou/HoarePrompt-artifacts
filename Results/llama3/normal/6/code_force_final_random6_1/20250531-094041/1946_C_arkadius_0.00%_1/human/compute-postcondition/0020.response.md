Functionality: **The function performs a binary search on a tree data structure with n vertices to find a specific value 'k'. It iteratively narrows down the search range by dividing the current range in half and adjusting the range based on the result of a helper function 'func_3'. The function returns the final value of 'beg' which is equal to 'end', indicating the position of 'k' in the tree.**
