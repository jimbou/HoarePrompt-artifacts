Functionality: **This function calculates and returns the total number of good components and the total remaining size in the subtree rooted at a given vertex 's' in a tree, where a good component is a subtree with a size greater than or equal to a given positive integer 'x'. The function modifies the tree object by aggregating the good components and remaining sizes from child vertices to their parent vertices.**
