Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with a vertices attribute that is a list of Vertex objects, `s` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= s < len(tree.vertices), `x` is a positive integer, `v` is equal to s, `postorder` is True, `tree.vertices[v].children` is not empty and has at least 3 children, `u` is the third child in the list, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components`, and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that the `remaining_size` attribute of the vertex at index `v` in the `tree.vertices` list has been increased by the `remaining_size` attribute of the vertex at index `u` (which is the third child of the vertex at index `v`). All other variables and attributes remain unchanged.
