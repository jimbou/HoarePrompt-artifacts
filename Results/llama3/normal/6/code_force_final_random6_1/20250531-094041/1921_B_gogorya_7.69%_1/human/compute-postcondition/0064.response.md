Output State: **t is greater than 2, n is an integer that must be greater than 0, s1 is a string of n characters, s2 is a string of n characters, a1 is the number of '1' characters in s1, a2 is the number of '1' characters in s2, res is the absolute difference between a1 and a2 plus the number of positions i where s1[i] is '1' and s2[i] is '0', hd is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, _ is 2, i is n, and res is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1' characters in `s1` and `s2`, plus the number of positions where `s1` has a '1' and `s2` has a '0'. The value of `hd` is 0, and the value of `i` is equal to `n`. The other variables remain unchanged.
