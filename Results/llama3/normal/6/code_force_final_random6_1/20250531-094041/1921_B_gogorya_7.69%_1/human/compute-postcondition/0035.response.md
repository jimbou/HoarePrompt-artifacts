Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 1, `s1` is a string of `n` characters, `s2` is a string of `n` characters, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `res` is the absolute difference between `a1` and `a2` plus 1, `hd` is the difference between `a1` and `a2` minus 1 if `hd` is greater than 0, otherwise `hd` remains the same, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `_` is 1, `i` is 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `res` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The absolute difference between `a1` and `a2` is now increased by 1. All other conditions and values of variables remain the same as in the initial state.
