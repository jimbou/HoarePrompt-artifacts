Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 2, n is an integer that must be greater than 0, s1 is a string of n characters, s2 is a string of n characters, a1 is the number of '1' characters in s1, a2 is the number of '1' characters in s2, res is the absolute difference between a1 and a2, hd is the difference between a1 and a2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, _ is 2, i is n, and res is printed, where res is the absolute difference between a1 and a2
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if hd > 0:
        hd -= 1
        continue
    if s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0':
        res += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 2, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `s1` is a string of `n` characters, `s2` is a string of `n` characters, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `res` is the absolute difference between `a1` and `a2` plus 1 if `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', otherwise `res` remains the absolute difference between `a1` and `a2`, `hd` is the difference between `a1` and `a2` minus 1 if `hd` was originally greater than 0, otherwise `hd` remains the same, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `_` is 2, `i` is 0, and `res` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is greater than 2, n is an integer that must be greater than 0, s1 is a string of n characters, s2 is a string of n characters, a1 is the number of '1' characters in s1, a2 is the number of '1' characters in s2, res is the absolute difference between a1 and a2 plus 2 if s1[i] is '1' and s2[i] is '0', otherwise res is the absolute difference between a1 and a2 plus 1, hd is the difference between a1 and a2 minus 1 if hd was originally greater than 0, otherwise hd remains the same, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, _ is 2, i is 1, and res is printed. If hd was originally greater than 0, then hd is one less than its original value. Otherwise, hd remains the same.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is greater than 2, n is an integer that must be greater than 1, s1 is a string of n characters, s2 is a string of n characters, a1 is the number of '1' characters in s1, a2 is the number of '1' characters in s2, res is the absolute difference between a1 and a2 plus 3 if s1[i] is '1' and s2[i] is '0', otherwise res is the absolute difference between a1 and a2 plus 2, hd is the difference between a1 and a2 minus 1 if hd was originally greater than 0, otherwise hd remains the same, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, _ is 2, i is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
