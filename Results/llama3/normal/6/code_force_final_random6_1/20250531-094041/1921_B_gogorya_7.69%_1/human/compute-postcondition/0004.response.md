Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `s1` is a string of `n` characters, `s2` is a string of `n` characters, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `hd` is the difference between `a1` and `a2`, `res` is the absolute difference between `a1` and `a2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `_` is 0, `i` is 0. The current value of `hd` is greater than 0, indicating that the difference between `a1` and `a2` is positive.**
