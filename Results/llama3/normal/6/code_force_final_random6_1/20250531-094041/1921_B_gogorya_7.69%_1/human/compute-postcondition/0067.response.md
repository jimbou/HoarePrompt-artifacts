Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer that must be greater than 0, s1 is a string of n characters, s2 is a string of n characters, a1 is the number of '1' characters in s1, a2 is the number of '1' characters in s2, res is the absolute difference between a1 and a2 plus the number of positions i where s1[i] is '1' and s2[i] is '0', hd is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus t, _ is t-1, i is n, and res is printed t times.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of t (the number of test cases) is greater than or equal to 0, the length of the strings s1 and s2 (n) is greater than 0, the number of '1' characters in s1 and s2 (a1 and a2) has been counted, the result (res) which is the absolute difference between a1 and a2 plus the number of positions i where s1[i] is '1' and s2[i] is '0' has been calculated and printed t times, and the loop has consumed all the test cases in stdin.
