Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case consists of two lines: a string s of n characters and a string f of n characters.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s1 = input()
    s2 = input()
    a1 = s1.count('1')
    a2 = s2.count('1')
    hd = a1 - a2
    res = abs(a1 - a2)
    for i in range(n):
        if hd > 0:
            hd -= 1
            continue
        if s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0':
            res += 1
    print(res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is greater than 0, n is an integer that must be greater than 0, s1 is a string of n characters, s2 is a string of n characters, a1 is the number of '1' characters in s1, a2 is the number of '1' characters in s2, res is the absolute difference between a1 and a2 plus the number of positions where s1[i] is '1' and s2[i] is '0', hd is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, _ is 0, i is n, and the result of the absolute difference between a1 and a2 plus the number of positions where s1[i] is '1' and s2[i] is '0' is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is greater than 1, n is an integer that must be greater than 0, s1 is a string of n characters, s2 is a string of n characters, a1 is the number of '1' characters in s1, a2 is the number of '1' characters in s2, res is the absolute difference between a1 and a2 plus the number of positions i where s1[i] is '1' and s2[i] is '0', hd is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, _ is 1, i is n, and res is printed, where res is the absolute difference between a1 and a2 plus the number of positions i where s1[i] is '1' and s2[i] is '0'

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is greater than 2, n is an integer that must be greater than 0, s1 is a string of n characters, s2 is a string of n characters, a1 is the number of '1' characters in s1, a2 is the number of '1' characters in s2, res is the absolute difference between a1 and a2 plus the number of positions i where s1[i] is '1' and s2[i] is '0', hd is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, _ is 2, i is n, and res is printed, and the value of res which is the absolute difference between a1 and a2 plus the number of positions i where s1[i] is '1' and s2[i] is '0' is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
