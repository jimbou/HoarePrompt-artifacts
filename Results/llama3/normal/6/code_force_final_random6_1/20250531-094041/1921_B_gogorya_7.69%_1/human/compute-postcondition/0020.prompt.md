Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 0, n is an integer, s1 is a string of n characters, s2 is a string of n characters, a1 is the number of '1' characters in s1, a2 is the number of '1' characters in s2, hd is the difference between a1 and a2, res is the absolute difference between a1 and a2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, _ is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if hd > 0:
        hd -= 1
        continue
    if s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0':
        res += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `s1` is a string of `n` characters, `s2` is a string of `n` characters, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `res` is the absolute difference between `a1` and `a2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `_` is 0, `i` is 0. If the current value of `s1[i]` is '1' and the current value of `s2[i]` is '0', then `res` is the absolute difference between `a1` and `a2` plus 1. If the difference between `a1` and `a2` is greater than 0, then `hd` is the difference between `a1` and `a2` minus 1. Otherwise, `hd` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 1, `s1` is a string of `n` characters, `s2` is a string of `n` characters, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `res` is the absolute difference between `a1` and `a2` plus 1 if the current value of `s1[i]` is '1' and the current value of `s2[i]` is '0', otherwise `res` is the absolute difference between `a1` and `a2`, `hd` is the difference between `a1` and `a2` minus 1 if the difference between `a1` and `a2` is greater than 0 and `hd` is greater than 0, otherwise `hd` is unchanged, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `_` is 0, `i` is 1. If `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', then `res` is the absolute difference between `a1` and `a2` plus 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is greater than 0, n is an integer that must be greater than 1, s1 is a string of n characters, s2 is a string of n characters, a1 is the number of '1' characters in s1, a2 is the number of '1' characters in s2, res is the absolute difference between a1 and a2 plus 2 if the current value of s1[i] is '1' and the current value of s2[i] is '0', otherwise res is the absolute difference between a1 and a2 plus 1, hd is the difference between a1 and a2 minus 1 if the difference between a1 and a2 is greater than 0 and hd is greater than 0, otherwise hd is unchanged, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, _ is 0, i is 2




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
