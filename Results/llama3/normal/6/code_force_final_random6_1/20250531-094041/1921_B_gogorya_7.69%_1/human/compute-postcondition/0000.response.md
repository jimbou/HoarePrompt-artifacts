The code accepts an input and assigns it to `t`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). The second line contains a string s of n characters, where the i-th character is '1' if there is a cat in the i-th box and '0' otherwise. The third line contains a string f of n characters, where the i-th character is '1' if there should be a cat in the i-th box and '0' otherwise. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. Since the first line of each test case is consumed by the input statement, the remaining lines of the test cases are still in the stdin.

Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case consists of two lines: a string s of n characters and a string f of n characters.**
