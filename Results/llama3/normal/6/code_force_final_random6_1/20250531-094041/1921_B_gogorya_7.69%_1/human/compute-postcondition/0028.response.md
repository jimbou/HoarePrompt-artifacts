Postcondition: ***t is greater than 1, n is an integer that must be greater than 0, s1 is a string of n characters, s2 is a string of n characters, a1 is the number of '1' characters in s1, a2 is the number of '1' characters in s2, res is the absolute difference between a1 and a2, hd is the difference between a1 and a2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, _ is 1, i is 0. If hd is greater than 0, the program state remains the same. Otherwise, no changes are made to the program state.***
