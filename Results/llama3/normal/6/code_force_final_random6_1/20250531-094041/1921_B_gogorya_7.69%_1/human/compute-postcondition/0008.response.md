Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `s1` is a string of `n` characters, `s2` is a string of `n` characters, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `res` is the absolute difference between `a1` and `a2` plus 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `_` is 0, `i` is 0. The current value of `s1[i]` is '1' and the current value of `s2[i]` is '0'. If the difference between `a1` and `a2` is greater than 0, then the current value of `hd` is the difference between `a1` and `a2` minus 1. Otherwise, the current value of `hd` remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `res` has been incremented by 1. This means that the absolute difference between the number of '1' characters in `s1` and `s2` has increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
