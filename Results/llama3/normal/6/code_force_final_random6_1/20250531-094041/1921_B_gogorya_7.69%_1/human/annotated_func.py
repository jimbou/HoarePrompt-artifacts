#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). The second line contains a string s of n characters, where the i-th character is '1' if there is a cat in the i-th box and '0' otherwise. The third line contains a string f of n characters, where the i-th character is '1' if there should be a cat in the i-th box and '0' otherwise. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        s1 = input()
        
        s2 = input()
        
        a1 = s1.count('1')
        
        a2 = s2.count('1')
        
        hd = a1 - a2
        
        res = abs(a1 - a2)
        
        for i in range(n):
            if hd > 0:
                hd -= 1
                continue
            if s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0':
                res += 1
        
        print(res)
        
    #State: t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer that must be greater than 0, s1 is a string of n characters, s2 is a string of n characters, a1 is the number of '1' characters in s1, a2 is the number of '1' characters in s2, res is the absolute difference between a1 and a2 plus the number of positions i where s1[i] is '1' and s2[i] is '0', hd is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus t, _ is t-1, i is n, and res is printed t times.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three lines: an integer n, a string s1 representing the current state of cat presence in boxes, and a string s2 representing the desired state of cat presence in boxes. For each test case, it calculates the absolute difference between the number of cats in the current and desired states, and then adjusts this difference by adding the number of positions where a cat is present in the current state but not in the desired state. The function prints this adjusted difference for each test case.
