Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three lines: an integer n, a string s1 representing the current state of cat presence in boxes, and a string s2 representing the desired state of cat presence in boxes. For each test case, it calculates the absolute difference between the number of cats in the current and desired states, and then adjusts this difference by adding the number of positions where a cat is present in the current state but not in the desired state. The function prints this adjusted difference for each test case.**
