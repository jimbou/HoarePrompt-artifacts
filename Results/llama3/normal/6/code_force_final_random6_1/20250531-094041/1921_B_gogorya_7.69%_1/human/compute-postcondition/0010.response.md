The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 1 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 1, `s1` is a string of `n` characters, `s2` is a string of `n` characters, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `res` is the absolute difference between `a1` and `a2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `_` is 0, `i` is 1. If the current value of `s1[i]` is '1' and the current value of `s2[i]` is '0', then `res` is the absolute difference between `a1` and `a2` plus 1. If the difference between `a1` and `a2` is greater than 0, then `hd` is the difference between `a1` and `a2` minus 1. Otherwise, `hd` remains unchanged.**
