Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `s1` is a string of `n` characters, `s2` is a string of `n` characters, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `res` is the absolute difference between `a1` and `a2` plus 1, `hd` is the difference between `a1` and `a2`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, `_` is 1, `i` is 0. If `hd` is greater than 0, the program state remains the same. Otherwise, no changes are made to the program state. The current value of `s1[i]` is '1' and the current value of `s2[i]` is '0'.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been incremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain the same. The program state remains unchanged if `hd` is greater than 0, and no changes are made otherwise. The current values of `s1[i]` and `s2[i]` are still '1' and '0', respectively.
