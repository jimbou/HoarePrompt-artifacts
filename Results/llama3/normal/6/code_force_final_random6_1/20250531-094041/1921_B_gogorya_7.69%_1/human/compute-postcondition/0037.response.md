To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 2, `s1` is a string of `n` characters, `s2` is a string of `n` characters, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `res` is the absolute difference between `a1` and `a2` plus 1 if `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', otherwise `res` remains the same, `hd` is the difference between `a1` and `a2` minus 1 if `hd` is greater than 0, otherwise `hd` remains the same, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `_` is 1, `i` is 2**
