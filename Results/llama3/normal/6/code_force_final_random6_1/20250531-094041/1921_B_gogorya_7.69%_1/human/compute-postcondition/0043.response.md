The code prints the value of `res`, which is the absolute difference between the number of '1' characters in strings `s1` and `s2`, plus the number of positions `i` where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0'.

Output: **the absolute difference between a1 and a2 plus the number of positions i where s1[i] is '1' and s2[i] is '0' (where a1 is the number of '1' characters in s1, a2 is the number of '1' characters in s2)**
