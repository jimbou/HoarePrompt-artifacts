Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 1, `s1` is a string of `n` characters, `s2` is a string of `n` characters, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `res` is the absolute difference between `a1` and `a2` plus 1 if the current value of `s1[i]` is '1' and the current value of `s2[i]` is '0', otherwise `res` is the absolute difference between `a1` and `a2`, `hd` is the difference between `a1` and `a2` minus 1 if the difference between `a1` and `a2` is greater than 0 and `hd` is greater than 0, otherwise `hd` is unchanged, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `_` is 0, `i` is 1. If `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', then `res` is the absolute difference between `a1` and `a2` plus 2.**
