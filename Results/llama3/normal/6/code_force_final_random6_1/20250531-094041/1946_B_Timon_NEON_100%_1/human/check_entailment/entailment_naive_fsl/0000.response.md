Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of the array after k operations, where in each operation, a contiguous subarray is selected and its sum is inserted anywhere in the array. The program does not correctly calculate this maximum sum.

One case where the program does not work correctly is when the input array contains negative numbers. The program's function `func_2` tries to find the maximum segment of the array, but it does not correctly handle the case where the maximum segment is a subarray with negative numbers. For example, if the input array is `[-1, -2, -3, -4]`, the program will incorrectly return `[-1, 0]` as the maximum segment, instead of `[-1, -2, -3, -4]`.

Additionally, the program's function `func_3` is incomplete and does not correctly calculate the maximum possible sum of the array after k operations.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
