Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is a list containing the maximum sum of consecutive non-negative integers in `arr` and 0, `segments_variants` is a list of lists where each sublist contains the maximum sum of consecutive non-negative integers in `arr` and the ending index of the corresponding segment, and the ending index of the last segment, and must have at least 1 segment, `max_sum` is -1, `total_max_segment` is a list containing -1, `segment` is the first segment in `segments_variants`. The current value of `total_max_segment[0]` is lower than the current value of `segment[0]` and the length of `segment` is not 1.***
