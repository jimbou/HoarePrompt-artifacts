Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `new_segment` is a list containing the current value of `arr[i]` and `i` if `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise it remains an empty list, `max_segment` is a list containing `arr[0]` and 0, `segments_variants` is an empty list, `max_sum` is -1.**

In this output state, the value of `max_segment[0]` has been updated to include the value of `arr[i]`, which is the first element of the list `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged.
