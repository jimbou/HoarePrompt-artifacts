Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a non-empty list with its first element incremented by the value of the first element of `arr`, `max_segment` is a list containing two integers where the first integer is the sum of the original first integer and the first element of `arr`, `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is either `max_segment` + `[i - 1]` or a list containing the elements of the original `new_segment` and `i - 1`.**

In this output state, the value of `segments_variants` has been updated by appending `max_segment + [i - 1]` to it. The other variables remain unchanged.
