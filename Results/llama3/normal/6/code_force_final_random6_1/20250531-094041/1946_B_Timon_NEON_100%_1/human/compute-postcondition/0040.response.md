Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `max_sum` is -1. If `new_segment` is not empty, then if `arr[i]` < 0, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is a list containing two integers where the first integer is the sum of the original first integer and the first element of `arr`, and `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is either `max_segment` + `[i - 1]` or a list containing the elements of the original `new_segment` and `i - 1`. Otherwise, `new_segment` is a non-empty list with its first element incremented by the value of the first element of `arr`, `max_segment` is a list containing two integers where the first integer is the sum of the original first integer and the first element of `arr`, and `segments_variants` is an empty list. If `new_segment` is empty, then if `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is a list containing the current value of `arr[i]` and `i`, `max_segment` is a list containing `arr[0]` + `arr[i]` and 0, `segments_variants` is an empty list. Otherwise, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is a list containing two values where the first value is greater than or equal to the first value of the original `new_segment` + `arr[1]` + `arr[i]`, and `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is either `max_segment` + `[i - 1]` or a list containing the elements of the original `new_segment` and `i - 1`.***
