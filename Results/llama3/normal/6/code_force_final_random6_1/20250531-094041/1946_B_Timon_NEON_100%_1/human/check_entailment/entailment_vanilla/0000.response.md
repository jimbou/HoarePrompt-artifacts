Reasoning:

The provided program is attempting to solve the problem of finding the maximum possible sum of an array after k operations, where each operation involves inserting the sum of a contiguous subarray anywhere in the array. The program consists of three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`.

`func_1` simply takes a number as input and returns the remainder of that number when divided by 1000000007, which is the modulo operation.

`func_2` takes an array as input and attempts to find the maximum contiguous subarray. It does this by iterating through the array and keeping track of the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray ending at each position. It also keeps track of the starting and ending indices of this maximum subarray. The function returns the maximum subarray.

`func_3` is incomplete and does not perform any operations.

The main issue with the program is that it does not correctly solve the problem. The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of the array after k operations, but the program only finds the maximum contiguous subarray and does not perform any operations to insert the sum of this subarray anywhere in the array.

Furthermore, the program does not handle the case where k is greater than 1, which means it does not perform multiple operations to insert the sum of the subarray multiple times.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
