Output State: **arr is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, i is 0, new_segment is an empty list, max_segment is a list containing two values where the first value is greater than or equal to the first value of the original new_segment, segments_variants is a list containing one element which is either max_segment + [i - 1] or a list containing the elements of the original new_segment and i - 1, max_sum is -1. The value of max_segment[0] is now greater than or equal to the first value of the original new_segment.**

Here's a natural language description of the output state:

The list `arr` remains unchanged, still containing at least one integer. The variable `i` is still 0. The list `new_segment` is now empty. The list `max_segment` has been modified, with its first element increased by the value of `arr[i]`, which is less than 0. This means the first element of `max_segment` is now greater than or equal to the first value of the original `new_segment`. The list `segments_variants` remains unchanged, still containing one element that is either `max_segment + [i - 1]` or a list containing the elements of the original `new_segment` and `i - 1`. The variable `max_sum` is still -1.
