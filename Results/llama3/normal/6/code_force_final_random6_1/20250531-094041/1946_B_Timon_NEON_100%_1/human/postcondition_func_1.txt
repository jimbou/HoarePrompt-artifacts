This function takes a list of integers as input and returns the segment with the maximum sum of consecutive non-negative integers, along with the ending index of the corresponding segment and the ending index of the last segment. The function iterates through the list, identifying segments of consecutive non-negative integers and keeping track of the maximum sum and corresponding segment. It returns the segment with the maximum sum, excluding segments of length 1.
