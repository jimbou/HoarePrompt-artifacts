Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `new_segment` is a non-empty list, `max_segment` is a list containing two values where the first value is greater than or equal to the first value of `new_segment`, `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is either `max_segment + [i - 1]` or a list containing the elements of `new_segment` and `i - 1`, `max_sum` is -1. The current value of `new_segment` is not empty. Additionally, the current value of `arr[i]` is less than 0.***
