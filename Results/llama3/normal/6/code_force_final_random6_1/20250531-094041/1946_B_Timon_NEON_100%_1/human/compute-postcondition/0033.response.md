Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `max_sum` is -1. If `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`, then `new_segment` is either an empty list or a non-empty list with its first element incremented by the value of the first element of `arr`, `max_segment` is a list containing two integers where the first integer is the sum of the original first integer and the first element of `arr`, and `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is either `max_segment` + `[i - 1]` or a list containing the elements of the original `new_segment` and `i - 1`. Otherwise, `new_segment` is a list containing the current value of `arr[i]` and `i`, `max_segment` is a list containing the current value of `arr[i]` and `i`, and `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is `new_segment` + `[i - 1]`.**
