Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is a list containing two values where the first value is `arr[1]` and the second value is 1, `max_segment` is a list containing two integers where the first integer is `arr[0]` and the second integer is 0, `segments_variants` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the value of `new_segment` has been updated to a list containing the current value of `arr[i]` and `i`, since `i` is 1 and `arr[i]` is `arr[1]`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
