Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `max_sum` is -1. If `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0, then `new_segment` is a list containing two values where the first value is `arr[1]` and the second value is 1, `max_segment` is a list containing two integers where the first integer is `arr[0] + arr[1]` and the second integer is 0, `segments_variants` is an empty list. If `arr[i]` is less than 0, then `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is a list containing two values where the first value is greater than or equal to the first value of the original `new_segment` + `arr[1]`, and `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is either `max_segment` + `[i - 1]` or a list containing the elements of the original `new_segment` and `i - 1`.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows: The list `arr` remains unchanged with at least two elements. The variable `i` is still 1, and `max_sum` is still -1. If the second element of `arr` is non-negative, the first element of `max_segment` is updated to be the sum of the first two elements of `arr`, while `new_segment` and `segments_variants` remain unchanged. If the second element of `arr` is negative, the first element of `max_segment` is updated to be greater than or equal to the original first element of `new_segment` plus the second element of `arr`, and `new_segment` and `segments_variants` remain unchanged.
