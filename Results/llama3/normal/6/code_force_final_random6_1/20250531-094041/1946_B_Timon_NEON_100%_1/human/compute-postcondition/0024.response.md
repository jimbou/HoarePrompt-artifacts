Output State: **arr is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, i is 1, max_sum is -1, new_segment is a list with its first element incremented by the value of the first element of arr, max_segment is a list containing two integers where the first integer is the sum of the original first integer and the first element of arr, segments_variants is an empty list.**

The code modifies the values of `new_segment` and `max_segment`. The first line increments the first element of `max_segment` by the value of `arr[i]`, and the second line increments the first element of `new_segment` by the value of `arr[i]`. The values of `arr`, `i`, and `max_sum` remain unchanged. The value of `segments_variants` is not affected by the code and remains an empty list.
