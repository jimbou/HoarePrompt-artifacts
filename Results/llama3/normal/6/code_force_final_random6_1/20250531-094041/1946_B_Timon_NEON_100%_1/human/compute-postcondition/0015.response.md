Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `new_segment` is a list containing the current value of `arr[i]` and `i`, `max_segment` is a list containing two zeros, `segments_variants` is an empty list, `max_sum` is -1. The current value of `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `arr` remains unchanged, `i` is still 0, and `new_segment` now contains the value of the first element of `arr` and its index 0. The other variables `max_segment`, `segments_variants`, and `max_sum` retain their initial values. The condition that the current value of `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0 still holds.
