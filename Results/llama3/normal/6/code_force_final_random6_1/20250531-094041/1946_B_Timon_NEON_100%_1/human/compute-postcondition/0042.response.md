Output State: **arr is a list of integers, new_segment is an empty list, max_segment is a list containing the maximum sum of consecutive non-negative integers in arr and 0, segments_variants is a list of lists where each sublist contains the maximum sum of consecutive non-negative integers in arr and the ending index of the corresponding segment, and the ending index of the last segment, max_sum is -1, total_max_segment is a list containing -1.**

In this output state, the code has appended two new sublists to the `segments_variants` list. The first sublist is a copy of `max_segment` with the ending index of the last segment appended to it. The second sublist is a copy of `new_segment` with the ending index of the last segment appended to it. The `total_max_segment` list has been initialized with a single element, -1. The values of `arr`, `new_segment`, `max_segment`, and `max_sum` remain unchanged.
