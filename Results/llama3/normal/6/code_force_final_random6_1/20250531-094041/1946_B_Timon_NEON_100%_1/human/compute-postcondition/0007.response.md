Output State: **arr is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, i is 0, new_segment is a non-empty list, max_segment is a list containing the same elements as new_segment, segments_variants is a list containing one element which is a list containing the elements of new_segment and i - 1, max_sum is -1. The current value of new_segment is not empty. Additionally, the current value of arr[i] is less than 0. The first element of max_segment is equal to the first element of new_segment.**

In this output state, the value of `segments_variants` has been updated to include a new list containing the elements of `new_segment` and `i - 1`. The value of `max_segment` has been updated to be equal to `new_segment`. All other variables remain unchanged.
