Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is a list containing the maximum sum of consecutive non-negative integers in `arr` and 0, `segments_variants` is a list of lists where each sublist contains the maximum sum of consecutive non-negative integers in `arr` and the ending index of the corresponding segment, and the ending index of the last segment, `max_sum` is -1, `total_max_segment` is the segment in `segments_variants` with the maximum sum and length not equal to 1.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `total_max_segment` will be updated to the segment in `segments_variants` with the maximum sum and length not equal to 1. This is because the loop iterates over all segments in `segments_variants` and updates `total_max_segment` whenever it finds a segment with a greater sum and length not equal to 1. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop head and body.
