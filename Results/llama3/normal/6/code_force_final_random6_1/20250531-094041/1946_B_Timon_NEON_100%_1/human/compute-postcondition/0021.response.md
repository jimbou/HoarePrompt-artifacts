Output State: **arr is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, i is 1, max_sum is -1, new_segment is a list containing the current value of arr[i] and i if arr[i] is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise it remains an empty list, max_segment is a list containing arr[0] and 0, segments_variants is a list containing one element which is either max_segment + [i - 1] or a list containing the elements of the original new_segment and i - 1.**

The code snippet modifies the state of the variables as follows:

- The first line appends the current value of `new_segment` plus `[i - 1]` to `segments_variants`. This means that `segments_variants` now contains one element which is either `max_segment + [i - 1]` or a list containing the elements of the original `new_segment` and `i - 1`.

- The second line assigns the value of `new_segment` to `max_segment`. This means that `max_segment` is now a list containing the current value of `new_segment`.

- The value of `new_segment` is determined by the initial state. If `new_segment` is not empty, then if `arr[i]` < 0, `new_segment` is an empty list. Otherwise, `new_segment` is a non-empty list with its first element incremented by the value of the first element of `arr`. If `new_segment` is empty, then `new_segment` is a list containing the current value of `arr[i]` and `i` if `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise it remains an empty list.

- The value of `max_sum` remains unchanged at -1.

- The values of `arr` and `i` remain unchanged.

- The value of `segments_variants` is updated to contain one element which is either `max_segment + [i - 1]` or a list containing the elements of the original `new_segment` and `i - 1`.

- The value of `max_segment` is updated to be a list containing the current value of `new_segment`.
