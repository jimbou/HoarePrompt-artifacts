To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `segment` and the list `segments_variants`. 

For the loop to execute, `segments_variants` must have at least one segment. At the start of the loop, `segment` should be the first segment in `segments_variants`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is a list containing the maximum sum of consecutive non-negative integers in `arr` and 0, `segments_variants` is a list of lists where each sublist contains the maximum sum of consecutive non-negative integers in `arr` and the ending index of the corresponding segment, and the ending index of the last segment, and must have at least 1 segment, `max_sum` is -1, `total_max_segment` is a list containing -1, `segment` is the first segment in `segments_variants`**
