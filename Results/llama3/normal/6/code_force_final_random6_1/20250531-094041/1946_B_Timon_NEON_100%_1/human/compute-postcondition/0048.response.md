Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is a list containing the maximum sum of consecutive non-negative integers in `arr` and 0, `segments_variants` is a list of lists where each sublist contains the maximum sum of consecutive non-negative integers in `arr` and the ending index of the corresponding segment, and the ending index of the last segment, and must have at least 2 segments, `max_sum` is -1, `total_max_segment` is the first segment in `segments_variants` if its sum is greater than the current `total_max_segment` and its length is not 1, otherwise `total_max_segment` remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but the value of `total_max_segment` has been updated to be the first segment in `segments_variants` if its sum is greater than the current `total_max_segment` and its length is not 1, otherwise it remains unchanged.
