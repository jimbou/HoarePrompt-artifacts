Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `max_sum` is -1. If `arr[i]` is less than 0, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is a list containing two integers where the first integer is the sum of the original first integer and the first element of `arr`, and `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is either `max_segment` + `[i - 1]` or a list containing the elements of the original `new_segment` and `i - 1`. Otherwise, `new_segment` is a list with its first element incremented by the value of `arr[i]`, `max_segment` is a list containing two integers where the first integer is the sum of the original first integer and the first element of `arr`, and `segments_variants` is an empty list.**
