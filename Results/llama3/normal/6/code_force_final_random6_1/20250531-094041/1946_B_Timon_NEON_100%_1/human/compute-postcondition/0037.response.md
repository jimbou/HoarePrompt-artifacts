Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is a list containing the current value of `arr[i]` and `i`, `max_segment` is a list containing `arr[0]` and 0, `segments_variants` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the value of `new_segment` has been updated to a list containing the current value of `arr[i]` and `i`, which is `[arr[2], 2]`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
