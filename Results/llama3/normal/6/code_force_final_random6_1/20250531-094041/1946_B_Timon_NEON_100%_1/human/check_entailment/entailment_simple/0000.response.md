Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing k operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum anywhere in the array. The program uses two functions: `func_1` to calculate the remainder of a number when divided by 1000000007, and `func_2` to find the maximum sum of consecutive non-negative integers in the array.

The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the length of the array and the number of operations. It then reads the array and calls `func_2` to find the maximum sum of consecutive non-negative integers. If the maximum sum is -1, it sets it to 0. Then, it calculates the answer by multiplying the maximum sum by 2 raised to the power of k, adding the sum of the array, and subtracting the maximum sum. Finally, it calls `func_1` to calculate the remainder of the answer when divided by 1000000007 and prints the result.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. However, there are a few potential issues:

1. The program assumes that the input array contains at least one non-negative integer. If the array contains only negative integers, the program will return an incorrect result.
2. The program uses a recursive approach to find the maximum sum of consecutive non-negative integers, which may cause a stack overflow for large inputs.
3. The program does not handle the case where k is 0, in which case the answer should be the sum of the array.

Despite these potential issues, the program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
