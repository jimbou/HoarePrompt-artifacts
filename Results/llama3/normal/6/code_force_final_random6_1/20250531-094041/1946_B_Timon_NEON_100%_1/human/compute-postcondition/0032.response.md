Output State: **arr is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, i is 2, max_sum is -1, new_segment is a list containing the current value of arr[i] and i, max_segment is a list containing the current value of arr[i] and i, segments_variants is a list containing one element which is new_segment + [i - 1].**

The code appends the current value of `new_segment` plus `[i - 1]` to `segments_variants`. Since `new_segment` is a list containing the current value of `arr[i]` and `i`, and `i` is 2, `new_segment` becomes `[arr[2], 2]`. `segments_variants` now contains one element which is `[arr[2], 2, 1]`.

The second line assigns the value of `new_segment` to `max_segment`. Since `new_segment` is `[arr[2], 2]`, `max_segment` becomes `[arr[2], 2]`.

No other variables are affected by the code. The value of `arr` remains unchanged, `i` remains 2, and `max_sum` remains -1.
