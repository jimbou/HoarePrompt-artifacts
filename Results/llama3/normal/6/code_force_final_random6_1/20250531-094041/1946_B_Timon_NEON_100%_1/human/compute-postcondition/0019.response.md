To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `arr`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `arr`. If `i` is less than the length of `arr`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `arr` must have at least 2 elements.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `max_sum` is -1. If `new_segment` is not empty, then if `arr[i]` < 0, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is a list containing two values where the first value is greater than or equal to the first value of the original `new_segment`, and `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is either `max_segment` + `[i - 1]` or a list containing the elements of the original `new_segment` and `i - 1`. Otherwise, `new_segment` is a non-empty list with its first element incremented by the value of the first element of `arr`, `max_segment` is a list containing two integers where the first integer is the sum of the original first integer and the first element of `arr`, and `segments_variants` is an empty list. If `new_segment` is empty, then `new_segment` is a list containing the current value of `arr[i]` and `i` if `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise it remains an empty list, `max_segment` is a list containing `arr[0]` and 0, `segments_variants` is an empty list, `max_sum` is -1.**
