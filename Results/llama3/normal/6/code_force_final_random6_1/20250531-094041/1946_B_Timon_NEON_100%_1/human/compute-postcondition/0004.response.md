Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `new_segment` is a non-empty list, `max_segment` is a list containing two values where the first value is greater than the first value of `new_segment`, `segments_variants` is an empty list, `max_sum` is -1. The current value of `new_segment` is not empty. Additionally, the current value of `arr[i]` is less than 0.**
