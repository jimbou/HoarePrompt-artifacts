Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `new_segment` is a non-empty list, `max_segment` is a list containing two values where the first value is greater than the first value of `new_segment`, `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is `max_segment + [i - 1]`, `max_sum` is -1. The current value of `new_segment` is not empty. Additionally, the current value of `arr[i]` is less than 0.**

In this output state, the value of `segments_variants` has been updated to include a new element, which is the concatenation of `max_segment` and the list `[i - 1]`. The value of `i` is still 0, and the value of `arr[i]` is still less than 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
