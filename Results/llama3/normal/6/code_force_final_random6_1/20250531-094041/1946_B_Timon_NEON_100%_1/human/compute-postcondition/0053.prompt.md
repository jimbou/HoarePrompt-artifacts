Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: arr is a list of integers, new_segment is an empty list, max_segment is a list containing the maximum sum of consecutive non-negative integers in arr and 0, segments_variants is a list of lists where each sublist contains the maximum sum of consecutive non-negative integers in arr and the ending index of the corresponding segment, and the ending index of the last segment, max_sum is -1, total_max_segment is a list containing -1.
Code of the loop:
for segment in segments_variants:
    if total_max_segment[0] < segment[0] and len(segment) != 1:
        total_max_segment = segment


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is a list containing the maximum sum of consecutive non-negative integers in `arr` and 0, `segments_variants` is a list of lists where each sublist contains the maximum sum of consecutive non-negative integers in `arr` and the ending index of the corresponding segment, and the ending index of the last segment, and must have at least 1 segment, `max_sum` is -1. If the first segment in `segments_variants` has a sum greater than the current `total_max_segment` and its length is not 1, then `total_max_segment` is updated to the first segment in `segments_variants`. Otherwise, `total_max_segment` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is a list containing the maximum sum of consecutive non-negative integers in `arr` and 0, `segments_variants` is a list of lists where each sublist contains the maximum sum of consecutive non-negative integers in `arr` and the ending index of the corresponding segment, and the ending index of the last segment, and must have at least 2 segments, `max_sum` is -1, `total_max_segment` is the first segment in `segments_variants` if its sum is greater than the current `total_max_segment` and its length is not 1, otherwise `total_max_segment` remains unchanged. If the sum of the first segment in `segments_variants` is greater than the current `total_max_segment` and its length is not 1, then `total_max_segment` is updated to the first segment in `segments_variants`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is a list containing the maximum sum of consecutive non-negative integers in `arr` and 0, `segments_variants` is a list of lists where each sublist contains the maximum sum of consecutive non-negative integers in `arr` and the ending index of the corresponding segment, and the ending index of the last segment, and must have at least 2 segments, `max_sum` is -1. If the sum of the second segment in `segments_variants` is greater than the current `total_max_segment` and its length is not 1, then `total_max_segment` is updated to the second segment in `segments_variants`. Otherwise, `total_max_segment` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
