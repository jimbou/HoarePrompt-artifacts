Output State: **arr is a list of integers, new_segment is an empty list, max_segment is a list containing the maximum sum of consecutive non-negative integers in arr and 0, segments_variants is a list of lists where each sublist contains the maximum sum of consecutive non-negative integers in arr and the ending index of the corresponding segment, max_sum is -1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

* The input list `arr` remains unchanged.
* The `new_segment` list is empty.
* The `max_segment` list contains two values: the maximum sum of consecutive non-negative integers in `arr` and 0.
* The `segments_variants` list contains one or more sublists, each containing the maximum sum of consecutive non-negative integers in `arr` and the ending index of the corresponding segment.
* The `max_sum` variable remains unchanged at -1.

Note that the loop iterates over the entire `arr` list, and the output state reflects the maximum sum of consecutive non-negative integers found in the list, along with the ending indices of the corresponding segments.
