Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `max_sum` is -1. If `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is a list containing the current value of `arr[i]` and `i`, `max_segment` is a list containing `arr[0]` + `arr[i]` and 0, `segments_variants` is an empty list. Otherwise, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is a list containing two values where the first value is greater than or equal to the first value of the original `new_segment` + `arr[1]` + `arr[i]`, and `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is either `max_segment` + `[i - 1]` or a list containing the elements of the original `new_segment` and `i - 1`.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows: The list `arr` remains unchanged with at least 2 elements. The value of `i` is still 2, and `max_sum` is still -1. If the current value of `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0, the list `new_segment` contains the current value of `arr[i]` and `i`, and the list `max_segment` now contains the sum of `arr[0]` and `arr[i]` as its first element and 0 as its second element. The list `segments_variants` is still empty. If the current value of `arr[i]` is less than 0, the list `new_segment` is empty, and the list `max_segment` now contains a sum that is greater than or equal to the original sum of `new_segment` and `arr[1]` and `arr[i]`. The list `segments_variants` contains one element which is either the updated `max_segment` with `i - 1` appended or the original `new_segment` with `i - 1` appended.
