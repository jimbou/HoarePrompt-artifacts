Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of the array after k operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum anywhere in the array. The program correctly implements this by using the `func_2` function to find the segment with the maximum sum of consecutive non-negative integers and then using this segment to calculate the maximum possible sum after k operations.

2. The `func_1` function correctly calculates the remainder of the maximum possible sum when divided by 1000000007, which is required by the problem.

3. The `func_2` function correctly identifies the segment with the maximum sum of consecutive non-negative integers. It iterates through the list, identifying segments of consecutive non-negative integers and keeping track of the maximum sum and corresponding segment. It returns the segment with the maximum sum, excluding segments of length 1.

4. The program correctly handles the case where the maximum segment has a sum of -1 (i.e., the array contains only negative numbers). In this case, it sets the maximum segment sum to 0.

5. The program correctly calculates the maximum possible sum after k operations by multiplying the maximum segment sum by 2^k and adding the sum of the original array minus the maximum segment sum.

Overall, the program correctly implements the required logic to solve the problem, and the functions work together to produce the correct output.
