To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Since `n` is already between 2 and 10^3 inclusive, it meets this condition. However, we need to adjust the state of `i` to ensure the loop executes.

Since the loop starts from 1 and goes up to `n` (inclusive), we can set `i` to 1 to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 49 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3 inclusive, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-1 integers (2 <= n <= 10^3)**
