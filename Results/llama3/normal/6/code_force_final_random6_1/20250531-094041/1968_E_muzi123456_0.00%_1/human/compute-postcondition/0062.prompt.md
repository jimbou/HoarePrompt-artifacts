Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, stdin contains t integers (2 <= n <= 10^3)
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        print('1', end=' ')
        print(i)
    print(' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 0 and 49 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3 inclusive, `i` is `n`, stdin contains t-1 integers (2 <= n <= 10^3), and '1' is being printed, and 1 is printed, and '1' is printed, and the value of `i` which is 2 is being printed, and '1' is printed, and the value of `i` which is 3 is being printed, ..., and '1' is printed, and the value of `i` which is `n` is being printed, and a space is being printed
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer between 0 and 48 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3 inclusive, `i` is `n+1`, stdin contains `t-1` integers, and '1' is printed, and 1 is printed, and '1' is printed, and the value of `i` which is 2 is being printed, and '1' is printed, and the value of `i` which is 3 is being printed, ..., and '1' is printed, and the value of `i` which is `n` is being printed, and a space is being printed, and '1' is printed, and a space is being printed, and the value of `i` which is `n+1` is being printed, and a space is being printed
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer between 0 and 47 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3 inclusive, `i` is `n+1`, stdin contains `t-1` integers, and the number 1 is printed, and this is printed: 1, and '1' is printed followed by a space, and the value of `i` which is 2 is printed, and '1' is printed followed by a space, and the value of `i` which is 3 is printed, and ... , and '1' is printed followed by a space, and the value of `i` which is `n` is printed, and a space is printed


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
