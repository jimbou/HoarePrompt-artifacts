Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 47 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3 inclusive, `i` is `n+1`, stdin contains `t-1` integers, and the number 1 is printed, and this is printed: 1, and '1' is printed followed by a space, and the value of `i` which is 2 is printed, and '1' is printed followed by a space, and the value of `i` which is 3 is printed, and ... , and '1' is printed followed by a space, and the value of `i` which is `n` is printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will have the same initial state for `t` and `n`, but `i` will be `n+1`. The loop will have printed the number 1 followed by a space and the value of `i` for each iteration from 1 to `n`. The stdin will still contain `t-1` integers.
