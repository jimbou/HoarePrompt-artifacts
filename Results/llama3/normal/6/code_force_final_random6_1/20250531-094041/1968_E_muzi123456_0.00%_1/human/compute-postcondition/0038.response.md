Output State: `t` is an integer between 0 and 48 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3 inclusive, `i` is `n`, stdin contains `t-1` integers, and '1' is printed, and 1 is printed, and '1' is printed, and the value of `i` which is 2 is being printed, ..., and '1' is printed, and the value of `i` which is `n-1` is being printed, and a space is being printed, and '1' is printed, and a space is being printed, and the value of `i` which is `n` is being printed, and '1' is printed followed by a space, and the value of `i` which is `n` is being printed.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: The loop has finished executing, and the value of `i` is now equal to `n`. The output includes the string '1' followed by a space, and then the value of `i` (which is `n`) is printed. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
