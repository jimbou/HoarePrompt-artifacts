The code prints the value of `i` which is the current iteration number in a sequence that starts from 1 and goes up to `n`. Since `i` is being printed after `n` iterations of printing '1' and the value of `i`, the value of `i` that is being printed is `n+1`. However, since the sequence only goes up to `n`, the value of `i` that is being printed is actually `n`. 

Output: **n (where n is an integer between 2 and 10^3 inclusive)**
