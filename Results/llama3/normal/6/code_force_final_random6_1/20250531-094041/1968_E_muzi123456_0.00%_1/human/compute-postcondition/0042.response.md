The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t.  If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is an integer between 0 and 48 inclusive, So for the loop to be executed one more time t must be greater than 0.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 48 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3 inclusive, `i` is `n+1`, stdin contains `t-1` integers, and '1' is printed, and 1 is printed, and '1' is printed, and the value of `i` which is 2 is being printed, and '1' is printed, and the value of `i` which is 3 is being printed, ..., and '1' is printed, and the value of `i` which is `n` is being printed, and a space is being printed, and '1' is printed, and a space is being printed, and the value of `i` which is `n+1` is being printed, and a space is being printed**
