Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program reads the number of test cases (t) and then for each test case, it reads the size of the grid (n). It then prints n points that maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

However, upon closer inspection, it becomes clear that the program does not actually solve the problem as described. The program simply prints the numbers from 1 to n, with each number preceded by the number 1. This does not maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

For example, when n = 3, the program prints:

1 1
1 2
1 3

However, the optimal arrangement for n = 3 is:

2 1
2 3
3 1

Which has a larger set of distinct Manhattan distances.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
