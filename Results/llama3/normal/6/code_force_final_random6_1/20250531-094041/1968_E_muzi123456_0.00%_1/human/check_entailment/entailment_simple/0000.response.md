Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program reads the number of test cases t and then for each test case, it reads the size of the grid n.

The program then prints n points, each with x-coordinate 1 and y-coordinate ranging from 1 to n. This is done using a for loop that iterates from 1 to n.

However, this approach is incorrect. The problem requires maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances, but the program's approach does not achieve this. The Manhattan distance between any two points with x-coordinate 1 is simply the absolute difference between their y-coordinates, which means that the set of distinct Manhattan distances will only contain values from 0 to n-1, which is not the maximum possible size.

For example, for n=3, the program will print the points (1,1), (1,2), and (1,3), which will result in a set of distinct Manhattan distances {0,1,2}. However, a better solution would be to choose the points (2,1), (2,3), and (3,1), which will result in a set of distinct Manhattan distances {0,1,2,3}, which is larger.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
