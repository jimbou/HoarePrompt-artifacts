Based on the precondition, the code has already printed a series of '1's and the values of `i` from 2 to `n`, followed by a space after each pair of '1' and `i`. The loop has completed all its iterations, and the variable `i` has reached the value of `n+1`.

Now, the `print(' ')` statement is executed. This statement simply prints a single space character.

Output: **a space**
