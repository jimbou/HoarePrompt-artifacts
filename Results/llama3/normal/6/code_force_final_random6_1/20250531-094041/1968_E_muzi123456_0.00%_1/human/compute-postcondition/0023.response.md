To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Since `n` is already between 2 and 10^3 inclusive, it already satisfies this condition. However, we need to adjust the state of `i` to ensure it starts from 1, as specified in the loop head.


State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 48 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3 inclusive, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-1 integers, and '1' is printed, and 1 is printed, and '1' is printed, and the value of i which is 2 is being printed, and '1' is printed, and the value of i which is 3 is being printed, ..., and '1' is printed, and the value of i which is n is being printed, and a space is being printed**
