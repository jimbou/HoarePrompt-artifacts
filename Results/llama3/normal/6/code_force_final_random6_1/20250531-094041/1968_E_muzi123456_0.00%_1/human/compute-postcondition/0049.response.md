To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer greater than 0.

To execute the loop again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

The state of `t` and the contents of `stdin` do not affect the loop condition, so they remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 47 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, stdin contains t-1 integers, and the number 1 is printed, and this is printed: 1**
