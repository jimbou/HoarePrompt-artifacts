Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description asks to maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells, but the program simply prints the coordinates (1, i) for i from 1 to n, which does not guarantee the maximum size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

For example, when n = 3, the program prints:

1 1
1 2
1 3

But the optimal arrangement is:

2 1
2 3
3 1

Which has a larger set of distinct Manhattan distances: {0, 1, 2, 3}.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
