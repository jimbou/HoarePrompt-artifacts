The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t. If t is not equal to 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, t is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, which already ensures that t is not equal to 0. Therefore, no adjustments are needed.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, stdin contains t integers (2 <= n <= 10^3)**
