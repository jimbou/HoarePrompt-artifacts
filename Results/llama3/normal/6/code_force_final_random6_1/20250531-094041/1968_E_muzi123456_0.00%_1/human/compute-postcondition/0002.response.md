Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 49 inclusive, n is an integer between 2 and 10^3 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 integers (2 <= n <= 10^3)**

The first line decrements the value of `t` by 1, so `t` becomes an integer between 0 and 49 inclusive. The second line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`, so `n` becomes an integer between 2 and 10^3 inclusive. Since one integer is consumed from stdin, the remaining number of integers in stdin is `t-1`.
