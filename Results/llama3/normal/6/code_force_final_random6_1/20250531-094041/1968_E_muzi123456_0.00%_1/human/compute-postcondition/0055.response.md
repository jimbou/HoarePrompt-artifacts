Based on the initial state, the code `print('1', end=' ')` will print the string '1' followed by a space.

Here's the step-by-step explanation:

* The `print` function is called with the argument `'1'`, which is a string literal.
* The `end` parameter is set to `' '`, which means that a space character will be printed after the string '1'.

Therefore, the output will be the string '1' followed by a space.

Output: **1 **
