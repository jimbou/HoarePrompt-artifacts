Output State: **t is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 10^3 inclusive, i is n+1, stdin is empty, and the number 1 is printed, and this is printed: 1, and '1' is printed followed by a space, and the value of i which is 2 is printed, and '1' is printed followed by a space, and the value of i which is 3 is printed, and ... , and '1' is printed followed by a space, and the value of i which is n is printed, and a space is printed, and this sequence is repeated t times.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable t is 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The variable n is still an integer between 2 and 10^3 inclusive, and the variable i is n+1. The stdin is empty, indicating that all the input integers have been processed. The output is a sequence of '1' followed by a space, and the value of i which is 2, and '1' followed by a space, and the value of i which is 3, and so on, until '1' followed by a space, and the value of i which is n, and a space is printed. This sequence is repeated t times, where t is the initial value of t.
