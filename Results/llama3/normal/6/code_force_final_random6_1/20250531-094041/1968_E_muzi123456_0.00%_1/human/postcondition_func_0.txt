This function reads a series of integers from standard input, where the first integer represents the number of test cases (t), and each subsequent integer represents the number of times (n) to print a sequence of numbers. The function then prints a sequence of numbers, starting with 1, followed by a space, and then the value of the current iteration (i), for each value of n. This process is repeated t times. The function does not return any value, but instead prints the sequences of numbers directly to the console.
