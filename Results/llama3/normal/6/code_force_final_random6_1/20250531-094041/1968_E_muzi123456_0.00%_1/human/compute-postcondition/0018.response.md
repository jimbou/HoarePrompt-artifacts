Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 49 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3 inclusive, `i` is `n`, stdin contains t-1 integers (2 <= n <= 10^3), and '1' is being printed, and 1 is printed, and '1' is printed, and the value of `i` which is 2 is being printed, and '1' is printed, and the value of `i` which is 3 is being printed, ..., and '1' is printed, and the value of `i` which is `n` is being printed**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `i` has reached the value of `n`, and the loop has printed '1' and the value of `i` for each iteration from 1 to `n`. The other variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the input state remains the same as the initial state.
