Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 48 inclusive, n is an integer between 2 and 10^3 inclusive, i is n, stdin contains t-1 integers (2 <= n <= 10^3), and '1' is printed, and 1 is printed, and '1' is printed, and the value of i which is 2 is being printed, and '1' is printed, and the value of i which is 3 is being printed, ..., and '1' is printed, and the value of i which is n is being printed, and a space is being printed**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been decremented by 1, so it is now between 0 and 48 inclusive. The value of `n` has been updated to the integer value of the input, which is between 2 and 10^3 inclusive. The value of `i` remains the same as `n`. The stdin still contains `t-1` integers. The print statements have been executed, printing '1', the value of `i` which is 2, '1', the value of `i` which is 3, ..., '1', the value of `i` which is `n`, and a space.
