Output State: `t` is an integer between 0 and 48 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3 inclusive, `i` is `n+1`, stdin contains `t-1` integers, and '1' is printed, and 1 is printed, and '1' is printed, and the value of `i` which is 2 is being printed, and '1' is printed, and the value of `i` which is 3 is being printed, ..., and '1' is printed, and the value of `i` which is `n` is being printed, and a space is being printed, and '1' is printed, and a space is being printed, and the value of `i` which is `n+1` is being printed.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `i` has reached the value of `n+1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop. The output includes the printing of '1' and the value of `i` for each iteration, followed by a space.
