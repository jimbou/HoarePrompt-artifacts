The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, i is n+1 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 1 and n is greater than 0.
State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 47 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-1 integers**
