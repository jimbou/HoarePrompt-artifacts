This function reads a series of integers from standard input, determines whether each integer is even or odd, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. For even integers, it generates a string consisting of 'AAB' repeated n//2 times and prints it if the string's length is less than 200. The function processes multiple test cases based on the initial input value t, and it consumes all input from stdin.
