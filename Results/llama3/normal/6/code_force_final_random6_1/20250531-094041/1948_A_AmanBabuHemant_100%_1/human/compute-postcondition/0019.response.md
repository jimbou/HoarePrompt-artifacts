Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 50).**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to the integer input from the first line of stdin, which is between 1 and 50 (inclusive). The value of `t` and `_` remains the same. The stdin now contains t-2 lines, each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 50), as one line has been consumed by the input operation.
