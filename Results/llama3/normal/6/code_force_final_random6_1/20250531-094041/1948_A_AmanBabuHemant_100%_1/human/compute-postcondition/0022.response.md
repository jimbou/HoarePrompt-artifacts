Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `s` is a string consisting of 'AAB' repeated n//2 times, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 50)**.

In this output state, the value of `s` is a string that consists of the substring 'AAB' repeated `n//2` times. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains `t-2` lines, each containing an integer `n` between 1 and 50 (inclusive).
