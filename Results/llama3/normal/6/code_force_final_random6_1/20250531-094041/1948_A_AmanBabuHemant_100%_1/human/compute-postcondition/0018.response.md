The only variable in the loop head is variable  `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 1 and `_` is 1.
State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 50). If `n` is odd, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is even, a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times is created. If the length of `s` is less than 200, 'YES' is printed, and the string `s` is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**
