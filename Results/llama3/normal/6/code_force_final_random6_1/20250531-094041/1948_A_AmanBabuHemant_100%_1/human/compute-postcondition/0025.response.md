The code prints the string `s` which consists of 'AAB' repeated `n//2` times. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `n//2` will be an integer between 0 and 25 (inclusive). Therefore, the string `s` will consist of 'AAB' repeated between 0 and 25 times.

Output: **'AAB' repeated n//2 times (where n is an integer between 1 and 50)**
