The code prints a string `s` which consists of 'AAB' repeated `n//2` times, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive) and is equal to the integer on the first line of stdin.
Output: **'AAB' repeated [n//2] times (where n is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive and is equal to the integer on the first line of stdin)**
