Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program is correct because it handles all possible cases according to the problem description. 

1. If the input number `n` is odd, the program correctly prints 'NO' because it's impossible to build a string with an odd number of special characters.

2. If the input number `n` is even, the program correctly builds a string with `n` special characters by repeating the pattern 'AAB'. The length of the string is at most 200, which meets the problem's requirement.

3. The program also checks if the length of the generated string is less than 200 before printing it, which ensures that the output string meets the problem's length requirement.

Overall, the program correctly handles all possible cases and meets the problem's requirements, so its correctness is **True**.
