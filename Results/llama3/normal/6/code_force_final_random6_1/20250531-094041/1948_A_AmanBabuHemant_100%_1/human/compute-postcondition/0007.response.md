Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `n` is even, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 50)**

In this output state, the value of `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times, because `n` is even and `n // 2` is an integer. The other variables and stdin remain unchanged.
