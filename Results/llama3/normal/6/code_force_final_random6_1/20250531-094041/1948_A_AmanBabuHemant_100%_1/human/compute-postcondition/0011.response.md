The code prints the string `s` which consists of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times, where `n` is an even integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive). Since `n` is even, `n // 2` will be an integer, and 'AAB' will be repeated that many times to form the string `s`. The length of `s` is less than 200.

Output: **'AAB' repeated n // 2 times (where n is an even integer between 1 and 50, inclusive)**
