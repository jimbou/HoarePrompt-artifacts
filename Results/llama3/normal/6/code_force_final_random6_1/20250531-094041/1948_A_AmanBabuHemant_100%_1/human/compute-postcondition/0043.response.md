Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive) and is equal to the integer on the first line of stdin, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 50). If `n` is odd, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is even, a string `s` consisting of 'AAB' repeated n//2 times is created. If the length of `s` is less than 200, 'YES' is printed and the string `s` is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
