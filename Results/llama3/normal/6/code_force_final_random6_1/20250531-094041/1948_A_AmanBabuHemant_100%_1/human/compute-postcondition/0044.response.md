Output State: **`_` is equal to `t`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive) and is equal to the integer on the last line of stdin, stdin is empty. If `n` is odd, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is even, a string `s` consisting of 'AAB' repeated n//2 times is created. If the length of `s` is less than 200, 'YES' is printed and the string `s` is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all iterations, and the loop variable `_` is now equal to the initial value of `t`. The variable `n` is equal to the integer on the last line of stdin, and stdin is empty because all lines have been processed. The output state also describes the final output based on whether `n` is odd or even, and whether the length of the string `s` is less than 200.
