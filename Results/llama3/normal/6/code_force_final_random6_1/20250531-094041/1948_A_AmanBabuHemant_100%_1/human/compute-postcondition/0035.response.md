Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive) and is equal to the integer on the first line of stdin, `s` is a string consisting of 'AAB' repeated n//2 times, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 50).**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to be a string consisting of 'AAB' repeated n//2 times, where n is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive) and is equal to the integer on the first line of stdin. The values of `t`, `_`, and `n` remain unchanged, and the contents of stdin also remain unchanged.
