Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive) and is equal to the integer on the first line of stdin, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 50).**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to be equal to the integer on the first line of stdin. The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged. The stdin now contains t-3 lines, each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 50), since one line has been read and processed.
