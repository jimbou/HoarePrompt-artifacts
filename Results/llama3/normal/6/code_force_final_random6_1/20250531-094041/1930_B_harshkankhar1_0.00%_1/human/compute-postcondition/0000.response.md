Output State: **a is a list of integers from 1 to the input integer, with every other element reversed, stdin contains a series of integers (the length of the permutation p for each test case).**

The first line creates a list `a` containing integers from 1 to the input integer (the number of test cases). The second line reverses every other element in the list `a`, starting from the first element. The stdin remains unchanged, still containing a series of integers (the length of the permutation p for each test case).
