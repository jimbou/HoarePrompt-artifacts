Output: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` and `k` are positive integers, `_` is 0, stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing two positive integers `n` and `k`. `n` is not equal to `k`. The current value of `n` plus 2 is greater than twice the current value of `k`, and 'YES' is printed**
