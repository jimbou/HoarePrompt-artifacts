To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`, which means we can only adjust the state of `_` and `t`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than the current iteration, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), and `_` is 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than the current iteration, and `_` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` and `k` are the positive integers from the first line of stdin, `_` is 2, stdin contains `t-4` lines, each containing two positive integers. If `n` equals `k`, 'YES' is printed, followed by the number 1, and the integer 1 is printed. If `n` is not equal to `k`, then if `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, 'YES' is printed, followed by the number 2, the difference between `n` and `k` plus 1, and finally the number 1. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**
