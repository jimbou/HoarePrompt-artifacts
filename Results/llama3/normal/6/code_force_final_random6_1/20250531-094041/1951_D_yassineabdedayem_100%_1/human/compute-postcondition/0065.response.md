Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 997 (inclusive), `n` and `k` are the positive integers from the last line of stdin, `_` is `t`, stdin contains 0 lines. If `n` equals `k`, 'YES' is printed, and 1 is printed twice. If `n` is not equal to `k`, and `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, 'YES' is printed, followed by 2, the difference between `n` and `k` plus 1, and finally 1. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop has finished executing, and the value of `t` is now between 0 and 997 (inclusive). The values of `n` and `k` are the positive integers from the last line of the input. The loop counter `_` has reached the value of `t`. The input stream `stdin` is now empty, containing no lines. The output depends on the values of `n` and `k`. If `n` equals `k`, the output is 'YES' followed by 1 twice. If `n` is not equal to `k` and `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, the output is 'YES' followed by 2, the difference between `n` and `k` plus 1, and finally 1. Otherwise, the output is 'NO'.
