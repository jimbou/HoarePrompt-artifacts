Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each case consists of two positive integers n and k. It then determines whether it's possible to satisfy a certain condition based on the values of n and k. If n equals k, it prints 'YES' followed by 1 twice. If n is not equal to k but n + 2 is greater than k * 2, it prints 'YES', 2, the difference between n and k plus 1, and 1. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function processes all test cases and prints the corresponding results.**
