Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when n is greater than k and n + 2 is not greater than k * 2. In this case, the program prints 'NO', but it is actually possible to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels.

For example, when n = 10 and k = 3, the program prints 'NO', but it is possible to set up the stalls with prices 4, 3, and 3, so that Alice buys exactly 3 jewels.

The program only considers two cases: when n is equal to k, and when n + 2 is greater than k * 2. It does not consider the case when n is greater than k and n + 2 is not greater than k * 2, which is why it is incorrect.
