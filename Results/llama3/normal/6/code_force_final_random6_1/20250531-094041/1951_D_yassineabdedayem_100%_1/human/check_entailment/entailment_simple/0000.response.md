Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly handles the three possible cases:

1. If `n` equals `k`, it prints 'YES' and sets up one stall with a price of 1, which will cause Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels.

2. If `n` is not equal to `k` and `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, it prints 'YES' and sets up two stalls. The first stall has a price of `n - k + 1`, which will cause Alice to buy `k - 1` jewels and be left with `n - (k - 1) * (n - k + 1)` coins. The second stall has a price of 1, which will cause Alice to buy the remaining 1 jewel.

3. If `n` is not equal to `k` and `n + 2` is not greater than `k * 2`, it prints 'NO', indicating that it is impossible to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

Correctness: **True**
