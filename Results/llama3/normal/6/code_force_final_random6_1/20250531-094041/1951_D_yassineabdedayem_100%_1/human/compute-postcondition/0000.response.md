The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that the standard input contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by `t` lines, each containing two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n, k <= 10^18), the value of `t` is assigned the value of the first integer in the input.

The value of `t` is now an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). The remaining input in the standard input is `t` lines, each containing two positive integers `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` lines, each containing two positive integers `n` and `k`.**
