Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` and `k` are the positive integers from the first line of stdin, `_` is 2, stdin contains `t-5` lines, each containing two positive integers.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged. The values of `n` and `k` are now the positive integers from the first line of stdin, which were read using `map(int, stdin.readline().split())`. The stdin now contains `t-5` lines, each containing two positive integers, since one line was read to assign values to `n` and `k`.
