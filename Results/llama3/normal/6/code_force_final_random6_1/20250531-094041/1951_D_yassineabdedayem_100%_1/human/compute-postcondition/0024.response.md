Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` and `k` are positive integers, `_` is 0, stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing two positive integers `n` and `k`. If `n` is equal to `k`, 'YES' is printed, and 1 is printed. If `n` is not equal to `k`, then if `n + 2` is greater than twice the current value of `k`, 'YES' is printed, 2 is printed, the difference between the current value of `n` and `k` plus 1 is printed, and 1 is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
