Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly handles the three possible cases:

1. When n equals k, it prints 'YES' and sets up one stall with a price of 1, allowing Alice to buy exactly k jewels.

2. When n does not equal k but n + 2 is greater than k * 2, it prints 'YES' and sets up two stalls. The first stall has a price of n - k + 1, allowing Alice to buy one jewel and be left with k - 1 coins. The second stall has a price of 1, allowing Alice to buy the remaining k - 1 jewels.

3. When n + 2 is not greater than k * 2, it prints 'NO', indicating that it is impossible to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels.

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem and handles all possible cases.

Correctness: **True**
