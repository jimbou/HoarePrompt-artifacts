Based on the precondition, we know that `n` and `k` are positive integers from the first line of stdin. The `print` statement is printing the expression `n - k + 1`.

Since `n` and `k` are positive integers, we can infer that `n - k + 1` will also be an integer. However, we cannot determine the exact value of this expression without knowing the specific values of `n` and `k`.

Therefore, the output will be an integer value representing the result of the expression `n - k + 1`, where `n` and `k` are the positive integers from the first line of stdin.

Output: **n - k + 1 (where n and k are the positive integers from the first line of stdin)**
