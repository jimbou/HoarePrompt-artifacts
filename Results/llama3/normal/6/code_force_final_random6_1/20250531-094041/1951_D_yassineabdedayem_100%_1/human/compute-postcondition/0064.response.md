Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` and `k` are the positive integers from the first line of stdin, `_` is 2, stdin contains `t-5` lines, each containing two positive integers. If `n` equals `k`, 'YES' is printed, and 1 is printed twice. If `n` is not equal to `k`, and `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, 'YES' is printed, followed by 2, the difference between `n` and `k` plus 1, and finally 1. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**
