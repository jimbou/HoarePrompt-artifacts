Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` and `k` are the positive integers from the first line of stdin, `_` is 1, stdin contains `t-3` lines, each containing two positive integers.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged. The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the positive integers from the first line of stdin. The stdin now contains `t-3` lines, each containing two positive integers, since one line has been read.
