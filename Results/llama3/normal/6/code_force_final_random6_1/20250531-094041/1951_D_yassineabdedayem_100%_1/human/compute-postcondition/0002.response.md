Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` and `k` are positive integers, `_` is 0, stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing two positive integers `n` and `k`.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` have been updated to the first pair of positive integers from the input, and the stdin now contains `t-1` lines of input, each containing two positive integers `n` and `k`. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0. The value of `t` is still an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive).
