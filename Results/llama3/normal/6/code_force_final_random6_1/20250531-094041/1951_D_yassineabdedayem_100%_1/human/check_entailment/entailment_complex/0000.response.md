Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly handles the three possible cases:

1.  If `n` equals `k`, it prints 'YES' and sets up one stall with a price of 1, which will result in Alice buying exactly `k` jewels.

2.  If `n` is not equal to `k` but `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, it prints 'YES' and sets up two stalls. The first stall has a price of `n - k + 1`, which will result in Alice buying `n - (n - k + 1) + 1 = k - 1` jewels from the first stall and 1 jewel from the second stall (which has a price of 1), for a total of `k` jewels.

3.  If `n` is not equal to `k` and `n + 2` is not greater than `k * 2`, it prints 'NO', indicating that it is impossible to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct results.

Correctness: **True**
