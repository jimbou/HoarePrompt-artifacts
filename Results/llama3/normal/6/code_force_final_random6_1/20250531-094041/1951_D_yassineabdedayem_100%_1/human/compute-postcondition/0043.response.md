Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` and `k` are the positive integers from the first line of stdin, `_` is 1, stdin contains `t-3` lines, each containing two positive integers. If `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, 'YES' is printed, followed by the number 2, the difference between `n` and `k` plus 1, and finally the number 1. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
