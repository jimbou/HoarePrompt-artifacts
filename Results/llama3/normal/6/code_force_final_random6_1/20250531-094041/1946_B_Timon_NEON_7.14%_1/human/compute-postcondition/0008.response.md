Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `new_segment` is a non-empty list, `max_segment` is a list containing two elements, `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is a list that contains the elements of either `max_segment` or `new_segment` and `i - 1`, `max_sum` is -1, and `i` is 0. The current value of `new_segment` is not empty. The current value of `arr[i]` is less than 0. Additionally, if the first element of `max_segment` is greater than the first element of `new_segment`, then `max_segment` remains unchanged and `segments_variants` contains `max_segment + [i - 1]`. Otherwise, `max_segment` is updated to contain the elements of `new_segment` and `segments_variants` contains `new_segment + [i - 1]`.***
