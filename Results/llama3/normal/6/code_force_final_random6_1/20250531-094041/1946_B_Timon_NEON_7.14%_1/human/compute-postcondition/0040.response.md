Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `segments_variants` is a list, `max_sum` is -1, and `i` is 2. If `new_segment` is true, then if `arr[i]` is less than 0, `segments_variants` is a list that contains the value of `max_segment` plus `[i - 1]` if `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`, otherwise `segments_variants` is a list with a new element appended, and `max_segment[0]` is incremented by `arr[i]`. If `arr[i]` is not less than 0, `max_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[2]`, and `new_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[2]`. If `new_segment` is false, `max_segment[0]` is increased by the 3rd element of `arr`. If the 3rd element of `arr` is non-negative, `new_segment` is a list containing the 3rd element of `arr` and the index 2.***
