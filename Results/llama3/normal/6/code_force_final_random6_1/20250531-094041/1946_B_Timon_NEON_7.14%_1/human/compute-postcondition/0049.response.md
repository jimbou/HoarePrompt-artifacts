Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is a list containing the maximum sum of a subarray of `arr` and the index of the last element of this subarray, `segments_variants` is a list of all subarrays of `arr` with maximum sum and two new subarrays appended that must have at least 2 segments, `segment` is the second segment in the list, `max_sum` is the maximum sum of a subarray of `arr`. If the sum of the second segment is greater than the sum of the maximum segment found so far, then `total_max_segment` is updated to be the second segment. Otherwise, `total_max_segment` remains the maximum segment found so far.***
