According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the segments_variants. If the list has at least 1 segment the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, max_segment is a list containing the maximum sum of a subarray of arr and the index of the last element of this subarray, new_segment is an empty list, total_max_segment is a list containing -1, max_sum is the maximum sum of a subarray of arr, arr is a list of integers. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 segment and the segment is the first segment in the list.
State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is a list containing the maximum sum of a subarray of `arr` and the index of the last element of this subarray, `segments_variants` is a list of all subarrays of `arr` with maximum sum and two new subarrays appended that must have at least 1 segment, `segment` is the first segment in the list, `max_sum` is the maximum sum of a subarray of `arr`, `total_max_segment` is a list containing -1**
