Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `segments_variants` is a list, `max_sum` is -1, and `i` is 1. If the element at index 1 in `arr` is non-negative, `new_segment` is a list containing the element at index 1 in `arr` and the integer 1, and `max_segment` is a list containing two elements where the first element is increased by the value of the element at index 1 in `arr`.***
