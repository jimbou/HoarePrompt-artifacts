Output State: **arr is a list of integers, new_segment is an empty list, max_segment is a list containing the maximum sum of a subarray of arr and the index of the last element of this subarray, segments_variants is a list of all subarrays of arr with maximum sum, max_sum is the maximum sum of a subarray of arr.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `arr` remains unchanged, the list `new_segment` is empty, the list `max_segment` contains the maximum sum of a subarray of `arr` and the index of the last element of this subarray, the list `segments_variants` contains all subarrays of `arr` with maximum sum, and the variable `max_sum` contains the maximum sum of a subarray of `arr`.
