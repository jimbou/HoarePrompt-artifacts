Output State: **arr is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, new_segment is a non-empty list with its first element increased by the value of the element at index i in arr, max_segment is a list containing two elements where the first element is increased by the value of the element at index i in arr and the second element is still 0, segments_variants is an empty list, max_sum is -1, and i is 0. The element at index i in arr is not less than 0.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `max_segment` and `new_segment` by adding the value of the element at index `i` in `arr` to their first elements. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the other variables (`arr`, `segments_variants`, and `max_sum`) are not affected by the code. The element at index `i` in `arr` is still not less than 0.
