Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is a list containing the maximum sum of a subarray of `arr` and the index of the last element of this subarray, `segments_variants` is a list of all subarrays of `arr` with maximum sum and two new subarrays appended that must have at least 2 segments, `segment` is the second segment in the list, `max_sum` is the maximum sum of a subarray of `arr`, `total_max_segment` is the second segment in the list**

In this output state, the value of `total_max_segment` has been updated to be equal to `segment`, which is the second segment in the list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
