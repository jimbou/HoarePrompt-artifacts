Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `new_segment` is a non-empty list, `max_segment` is a list containing two zeros, `segments_variants` is an empty list, `max_sum` is -1, and `i` is 0. The current value of `new_segment` is not empty. The current value of `arr[i]` is less than 0. The first element of `max_segment` is less than or equal to the first element of `new_segment`.***
