The code `max_segment[0] += arr[i]` adds the value of `arr[i]` to the first element of `max_segment`. Since `i` is 0, `arr[i]` is the first element of `arr`. The value of `max_segment[0]` is initially 0, so it becomes equal to the first element of `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `new_segment` is a list containing the current value of `arr[i]` and `i` if `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise it remains an empty list, `max_segment` is a list containing the first element of `arr` and 0, `segments_variants` is an empty list, `max_sum` is -1, `i` is 0**
