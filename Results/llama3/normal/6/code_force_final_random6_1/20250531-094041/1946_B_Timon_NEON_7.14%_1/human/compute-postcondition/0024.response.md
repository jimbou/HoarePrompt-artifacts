Output State: **arr is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, new_segment is a list where the first element is increased by the value of the element at index 1 in arr, max_segment is a list containing two elements where the first element is increased by the value of the element at index 1 in arr, segments_variants is a list, max_sum is -1, and i is 1**

The code snippet modifies the `max_segment` and `new_segment` lists by adding the value of the element at index `i` in the `arr` list to their first elements. Since `i` is 1, the value added is the second element of `arr`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
