Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is a list containing the maximum sum of a subarray of `arr` and the index of the last element of this subarray, `segments_variants` is a list of all subarrays of `arr` with maximum sum and two new subarrays appended, `segment` is the last segment in the list, `max_sum` is the maximum sum of a subarray of `arr`, and `total_max_segment` is the segment with the maximum sum among all segments in `segments_variants`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the `total_max_segment` variable will hold the segment with the maximum sum among all segments in the `segments_variants` list. The other variables remain unchanged, with `arr` still being the original list of integers, `new_segment` being an empty list, `max_segment` containing the maximum sum of a subarray of `arr` and its last index, `segments_variants` being the list of all subarrays of `arr` with maximum sum and two new subarrays appended, and `max_sum` being the maximum sum of a subarray of `arr`.
