Output State: **arr is a list of integers with at least 1 element, new_segment is an empty list, max_segment is a list containing two elements where the first element is greater than its original value by the value of arr[i], segments_variants is a list containing one element which is a list that contains the elements of either max_segment or new_segment and i - 1, max_sum is -1, and i is 0. The current value of arr[i] is less than 0.**

In this output state, the value of `new_segment` has been reset to an empty list. The first element of `max_segment` has been incremented by the value of `arr[i]`, which is less than 0. The value of `segments_variants` remains unchanged, containing either `max_segment + [i - 1]` or `new_segment + [i - 1]`, depending on the original values of `max_segment` and `new_segment`. The values of `arr`, `max_sum`, and `i` remain unchanged.
