Output State: **arr is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, new_segment is an empty list, max_sum is -1, i is 1, segments_variants is a list containing max_segment + [i - 1], and max_segment is a list with its first element incremented by the value of arr[i].**

In this output state, the value of `arr` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `new_segment` is reset to an empty list. The value of `max_sum` remains -1 as it is not affected by the code. The value of `i` remains 1 as it is not modified. The value of `segments_variants` is updated to contain `max_segment + [i - 1]` because the first element of `max_segment` is greater than the first element of `new_segment`. The value of `max_segment` is updated by incrementing its first element by the value of `arr[i]`.
