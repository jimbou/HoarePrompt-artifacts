Output State: **arr is a list of integers, new_segment is an empty list, max_segment is a list containing the maximum sum of a subarray of arr and the index of the last element of this subarray, segments_variants is a list of all subarrays of arr with maximum sum and two new subarrays appended, max_sum is the maximum sum of a subarray of arr, total_max_segment is a list containing -1.**

The first line appends a new subarray to `segments_variants`, which is a combination of `max_segment` and the index of the last element of `arr`. The second line appends another new subarray to `segments_variants`, which is a combination of `new_segment` and the index of the last element of `arr`. The third line assigns a new value to `total_max_segment`, which is a list containing -1. No other variables are affected.
