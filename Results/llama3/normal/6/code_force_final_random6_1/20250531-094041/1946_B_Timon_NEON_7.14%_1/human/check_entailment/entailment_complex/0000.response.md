Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing exactly k operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum anywhere in the array. The program consists of three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and an unnamed function.

`func_1` takes an integer as input and returns the remainder of the integer when divided by 1000000007. This function is used to handle the large sums that can result from the operations.

`func_2` takes a list of integers as input and returns the subarray with the maximum sum. If no such subarray exists, it returns a list containing -1. This function is used to find the maximum sum segment in the input array.

The main part of the program reads the input, calls `func_2` to find the maximum sum segment, and then calculates the maximum possible sum after k operations. It uses the result of `func_2` to determine the maximum sum segment and then calculates the maximum possible sum by multiplying the sum of this segment by 2 raised to the power of k, adding the sum of the original array, and subtracting the sum of the maximum sum segment.

The program also handles the case where the maximum sum segment has only one element by setting its sum to 0.

The unnamed function is not used in the program and can be ignored.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible sum of the array after k operations, and it handles the cases where the maximum sum segment has only one element or does not exist.

Correctness: **True**
