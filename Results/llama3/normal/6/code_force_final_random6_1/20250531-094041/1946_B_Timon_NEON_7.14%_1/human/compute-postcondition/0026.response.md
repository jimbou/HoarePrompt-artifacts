Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `new_segment` is a list containing the element at index 1 in `arr` and the integer 1, `max_segment` is a list containing two elements where the first element is increased by the value of the element at index 1 in `arr`, `segments_variants` is a list, `max_sum` is -1, and `i` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `new_segment` has been updated to contain the element at index 1 in `arr` and the integer 1. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
