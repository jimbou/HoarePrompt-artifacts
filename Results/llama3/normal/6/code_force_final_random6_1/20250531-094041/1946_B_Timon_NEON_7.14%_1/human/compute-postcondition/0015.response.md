Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `new_segment` is a list containing the current value of `arr[i]` and `i`, `max_segment` is a list containing two zeros, `segments_variants` is an empty list, `max_sum` is -1, `i` is 0. The current value of `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `arr` remains unchanged, but a new list `new_segment` is created containing the current value of `arr[i]` and the index `i`. The other variables (`max_segment`, `segments_variants`, `max_sum`, and `i`) retain their initial values. The current value of `arr[i]` is still greater than or equal to 0.
