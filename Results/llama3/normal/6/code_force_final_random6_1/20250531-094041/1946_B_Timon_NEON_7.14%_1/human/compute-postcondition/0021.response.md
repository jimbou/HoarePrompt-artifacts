Output State: **arr is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, new_segment is a list, max_segment is a list containing the elements of new_segment, segments_variants is a list containing the elements of new_segment and the value i - 1, max_sum is -1, and i is 1**

The code snippet modifies the values of `segments_variants` and `max_segment`. The first line appends a new list to `segments_variants`, which contains the elements of `new_segment` and the value `i - 1`. Since `i` is 1, `i - 1` is 0. The second line assigns the value of `new_segment` to `max_segment`. The other variables, `arr`, `new_segment`, `max_sum`, and `i`, remain unchanged.
