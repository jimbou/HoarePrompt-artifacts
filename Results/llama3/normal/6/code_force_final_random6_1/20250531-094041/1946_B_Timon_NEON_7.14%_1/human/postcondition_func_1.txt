This function takes a list of integers as input and returns the subarray with the maximum sum. If no such subarray exists, it returns a list containing -1. The function iterates through the input list, identifying segments of consecutive integers with positive sums, and keeps track of the maximum sum segment found so far. It also considers the case where the maximum sum segment is at the end of the input list. If the maximum sum segment has only one element, it returns a list containing -1. Otherwise, it returns the maximum sum segment, which includes the sum of the segment and the index of its last element.
