Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `segments_variants` is a list, `max_sum` is -1, `i` is 2, `max_segment[0]` is increased by the 3rd element of `arr`. If the 3rd element of `arr` is non-negative, `new_segment` is a list containing the 3rd element of `arr` and the index 2.**

In this output state, the value of `max_segment[0]` has been updated by adding the 3rd element of `arr` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition regarding the 3rd element of `arr` and the list `new_segment` is still valid.
