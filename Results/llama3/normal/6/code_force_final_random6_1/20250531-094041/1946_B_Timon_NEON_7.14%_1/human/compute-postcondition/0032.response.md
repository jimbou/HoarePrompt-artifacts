Output State: **arr is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, segments_variants is a list with a new element appended, max_sum is -1, i is 2, max_segment is new_segment**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line appends a new element to the `segments_variants` list, which is a combination of `new_segment` and the value of `i - 1`. Since `i` is 2, the new element appended is `new_segment + [1]`. The second line assigns the value of `new_segment` to `max_segment`. 

The initial state of `arr` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, but this variable is not affected by the code snippet. The initial state of `segments_variants` is a list, and a new element is appended to it. The initial state of `max_sum` is -1, but this variable is not modified by the code snippet. The initial state of `i` is 2, but this variable is not modified by the code snippet. The variable `max_segment` is assigned the value of `new_segment`.
