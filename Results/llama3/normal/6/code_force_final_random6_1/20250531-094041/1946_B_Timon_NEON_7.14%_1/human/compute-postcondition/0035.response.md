Output State: **arr is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, segments_variants is a list, max_sum is -1, i is 2, max_segment[0] is increased by arr[2], and new_segment[0] is increased by arr[2].**

In this output state, the values of `arr`, `segments_variants`, `max_sum`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The code only affects the values of `max_segment[0]` and `new_segment[0]`, which are both incremented by the value of `arr[i]`, where `i` is 2.
