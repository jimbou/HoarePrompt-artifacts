Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `new_segment` is a non-empty list, `max_segment` is a list containing two zeros, `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is `max_segment + [i - 1]`, `max_sum` is -1, and `i` is 0. The current value of `new_segment` is not empty. The current value of `arr[i]` is less than 0. Additionally, the first element of `max_segment` is greater than the first element of `new_segment`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of segments_variants now contains one element which is a combination of max_segment and the value of i-1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
