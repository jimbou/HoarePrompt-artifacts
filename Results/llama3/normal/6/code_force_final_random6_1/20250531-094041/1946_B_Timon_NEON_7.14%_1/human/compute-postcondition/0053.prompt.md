Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: arr is a list of integers, new_segment is an empty list, max_segment is a list containing the maximum sum of a subarray of arr and the index of the last element of this subarray, segments_variants is a list of all subarrays of arr with maximum sum and two new subarrays appended, max_sum is the maximum sum of a subarray of arr, total_max_segment is a list containing -1.
Code of the loop:
for segment in segments_variants:
    if total_max_segment[0] < segment[0]:
        total_max_segment = segment


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is a list containing the maximum sum of a subarray of `arr` and the index of the last element of this subarray, `segments_variants` is a list of all subarrays of `arr` with maximum sum and two new subarrays appended that must have at least 1 segment, `segment` is the first segment in the list, `max_sum` is the maximum sum of a subarray of `arr`. If the first element of `total_max_segment` is less than the first element of `segment`, then `total_max_segment` is updated to contain the first segment in the list. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is a list containing the maximum sum of a subarray of `arr` and the index of the last element of this subarray, `segments_variants` is a list of all subarrays of `arr` with maximum sum and two new subarrays appended that must have at least 2 segments, `segment` is the second segment in the list, `max_sum` is the maximum sum of a subarray of `arr`. If the sum of the second segment is greater than the sum of the maximum segment found so far, then `total_max_segment` is updated to be the second segment. Otherwise, `total_max_segment` remains the maximum segment found so far.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is a list containing the maximum sum of a subarray of `arr` and the index of the last element of this subarray, `segments_variants` is a list of all subarrays of `arr` with maximum sum and two new subarrays appended that must have at least 3 segments, `segment` is the third segment in the list, `max_sum` is the maximum sum of a subarray of `arr`. If the sum of the third segment is greater than the sum of the maximum segment found so far, then `total_max_segment` is updated to the third segment. Otherwise, `total_max_segment` remains the maximum segment found so far.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
