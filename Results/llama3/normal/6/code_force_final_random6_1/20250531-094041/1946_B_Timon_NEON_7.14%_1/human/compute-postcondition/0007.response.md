Output State: **arr is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, new_segment is a non-empty list, max_segment is a list containing the elements of new_segment, segments_variants is a list containing one element which is a list that contains the elements of new_segment and i - 1, max_sum is -1, and i is 0. The current value of new_segment is not empty. The current value of arr[i] is less than 0.**

The first line of code adds a new element to the `segments_variants` list. This new element is a list that contains the elements of `new_segment` and `i - 1`. Since `i` is 0, `i - 1` is -1. Therefore, the new element added to `segments_variants` is a list that contains the elements of `new_segment` and -1.

The second line of code assigns the value of `new_segment` to `max_segment`. Since `new_segment` is a non-empty list, `max_segment` becomes a list containing the elements of `new_segment`.

The values of `arr`, `max_sum`, and `i` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The value of `new_segment` also remains unchanged, as it is only used to assign values to other variables, but its own value is not modified.

Therefore, the final output state is as described above.
