Correctness: **False**.

The program is incorrect because it does not implement the required functionality to find the maximum possible sum of the array after k operations. The provided functions do not seem to be related to the problem description, and there is no clear logic to solve the problem.

For example, the function `func_2` seems to be trying to find the maximum segment of positive numbers in the array, but it does not take into account the number of operations k, and it does not calculate the maximum possible sum of the array after k operations.

The function `func_3` is incomplete and does not provide any logic to solve the problem.

To solve this problem, we need to implement a dynamic programming approach that takes into account the number of operations k and calculates the maximum possible sum of the array after k operations.

Here is a possible correct implementation:
```
def max_sum_after_k_operations(arr, k):
    n = len(arr)
    prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + arr[i]
    
    max_sum = float('-inf')
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            segment_sum = prefix_sum[j + 1] - prefix_sum[i]
            remaining_sum = prefix_sum[n] - segment_sum
            max_sum = max(max_sum, segment_sum + remaining_sum * k)
    
    return max_sum % (10**9 + 7)
```
This implementation uses a prefix sum array to efficiently calculate the sum of any segment of the array. It then iterates over all possible segments of the array and calculates the maximum possible sum after k operations by adding the segment sum to the remaining sum multiplied by k. Finally, it returns the maximum sum modulo 10^9 + 7.
