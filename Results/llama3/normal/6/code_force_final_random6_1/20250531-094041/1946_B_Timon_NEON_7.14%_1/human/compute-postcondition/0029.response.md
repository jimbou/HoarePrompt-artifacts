Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `segments_variants` is a list, `max_sum` is -1, and `i` is 1. If `arr[i]` is negative, `new_segment` is an empty list, `segments_variants` contains `max_segment` + `[i - 1]`, and the first element of `max_segment` is incremented by the value of `arr[i]`. If `arr[i]` is non-negative, `new_segment` is a list containing the element at index 1 in `arr` and the integer 1, and `max_segment` is a list containing two elements where the first element is increased by the value of the element at index 1 in `arr`.***
