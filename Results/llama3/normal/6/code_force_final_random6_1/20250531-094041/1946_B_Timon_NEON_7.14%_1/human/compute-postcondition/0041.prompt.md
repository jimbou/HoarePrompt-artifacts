Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: arr is a list of integers, new_segment is an empty list, max_segment is a list containing two zeros, segments_variants is an empty list, max_sum is -1
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(arr)):
    if new_segment:
        if arr[i] < 0:
            if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]:
                segments_variants.append(max_segment + [i - 1])
            else:
                segments_variants.append(new_segment + [i - 1])
                max_segment = new_segment
            new_segment = []
            max_segment[0] += arr[i]
        else:
            max_segment[0] += arr[i]
            new_segment[0] += arr[i]
    else:
        if arr[i] >= 0:
            new_segment = [arr[i], i]
        max_segment[0] += arr[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `new_segment` is a list, `max_segment` is a list containing two elements where the first element is increased by the value of the element at index i in arr, `segments_variants` is a list, `max_sum` is -1, and `i` is 0. If `new_segment` is not empty, then if the element at index i in arr is less than 0, `new_segment` is an empty list and `segments_variants` contains one element which is a list that contains the elements of either max_segment or new_segment and i - 1. Otherwise, `new_segment` is a non-empty list with its first element increased by the value of the element at index i in arr. If `new_segment` is empty, then `new_segment` is a list containing the current value of `arr[i]` and `i` if `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise it remains an empty list, `max_segment` is a list containing the first element of `arr` and 0, `segments_variants` is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `segments_variants` is a list, `max_sum` is -1, and `i` is 1. If `arr[i]` is negative, `new_segment` is an empty list, `segments_variants` contains `max_segment` + `[i - 1]`, and the first element of `max_segment` is incremented by the value of `arr[i]`. If `arr[i]` is non-negative, `new_segment` is a list containing the element at index 1 in `arr` and the integer 1, and `max_segment` is a list containing two elements where the first element is increased by the value of the element at index 1 in `arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`arr` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `segments_variants` is a list, `max_sum` is -1, and `i` is 2. If `new_segment` is true, then if `arr[i]` is less than 0, `segments_variants` is a list that contains the value of `max_segment` plus `[i - 1]` if `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`, otherwise `segments_variants` is a list with a new element appended, and `max_segment[0]` is incremented by `arr[i]`. If `arr[i]` is not less than 0, `max_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[2]`, and `new_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[2]`. If `new_segment` is false, `max_segment[0]` is increased by the 3rd element of `arr`. If the 3rd element of `arr` is non-negative, `new_segment` is a list containing the 3rd element of `arr` and the index 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
