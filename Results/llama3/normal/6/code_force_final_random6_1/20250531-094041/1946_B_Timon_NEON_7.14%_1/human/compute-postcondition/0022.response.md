Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `new_segment` is a list, `max_sum` is -1, and `i` is 1. If the first element of `max_segment` is greater than the first element of `new_segment`, then `segments_variants` is a list containing `max_segment + [i - 1]`. Otherwise, `segments_variants` is a list containing the elements of `new_segment` and the value `i - 1`, and `max_segment` is a list containing the elements of `new_segment`.***
