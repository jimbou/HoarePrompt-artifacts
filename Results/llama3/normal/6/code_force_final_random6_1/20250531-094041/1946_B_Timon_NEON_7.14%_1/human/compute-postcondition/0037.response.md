Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `segments_variants` is a list, `max_sum` is -1, `i` is 2, and `new_segment` is a list containing the 3rd element of `arr` and the index 2.**

In this output state, the value of `new_segment` is specifically determined as a list containing the 3rd element of `arr` (since `i` is 2) and the index 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
