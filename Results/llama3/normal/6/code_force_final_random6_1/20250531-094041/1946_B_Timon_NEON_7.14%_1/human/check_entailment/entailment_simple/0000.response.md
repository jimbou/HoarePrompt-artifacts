Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem where we need to find the maximum possible sum of an array after performing k operations. In each operation, we can select any contiguous subarray of the array and insert the sum of this subarray anywhere in the array. The program uses two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, to achieve this.

`func_1` simply returns the remainder of the input number when divided by 1000000007, which is used to handle large numbers.

`func_2` is used to find the maximum sum of a subarray in the given array. It iterates through the array, maintaining a running sum of the current subarray and the maximum sum found so far. It also keeps track of the starting and ending indices of the maximum sum subarray. If the current element is negative, it checks if the current subarray sum is greater than the maximum sum found so far. If it is, it updates the maximum sum and the corresponding indices. If the current element is non-negative, it simply adds it to the current subarray sum and the maximum sum.

The main part of the program reads the input, calls `func_2` to find the maximum sum subarray, and then calculates the maximum possible sum after k operations. It does this by multiplying the maximum sum by 2 raised to the power of k, adding the sum of the original array, and subtracting the maximum sum. This is because we can insert the maximum sum subarray k times, and the sum of the original array remains the same.

The program then prints the result of `func_1` applied to the calculated maximum possible sum, which gives the final answer modulo 1000000007.

Correctness: **True**
