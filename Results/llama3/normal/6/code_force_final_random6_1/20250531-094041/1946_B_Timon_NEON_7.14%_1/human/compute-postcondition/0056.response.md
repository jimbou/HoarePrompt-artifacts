Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is a list containing the maximum sum of a subarray of `arr` and the index of the last element of this subarray, `segments_variants` is a list of all subarrays of `arr` with maximum sum and two new subarrays appended, `segment` is the last segment in the list, `max_sum` is the maximum sum of a subarray of `arr`. If the length of `total_max_segment` is 1, then `total_max_segment` is a list containing -1. Otherwise, `total_max_segment` is the segment with the maximum sum among all segments in `segments_variants`.***
