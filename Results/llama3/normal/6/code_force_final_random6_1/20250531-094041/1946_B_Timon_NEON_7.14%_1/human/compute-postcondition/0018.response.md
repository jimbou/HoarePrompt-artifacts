Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `new_segment` is a list, `max_segment` is a list containing two elements where the first element is increased by the value of the element at index i in arr, `segments_variants` is a list, `max_sum` is -1, and `i` is 0. If `new_segment` is not empty, then if the element at index i in arr is less than 0, `new_segment` is an empty list and `segments_variants` contains one element which is a list that contains the elements of either max_segment or new_segment and i - 1. Otherwise, `new_segment` is a non-empty list with its first element increased by the value of the element at index i in arr. If `new_segment` is empty, then `new_segment` is a list containing the current value of `arr[i]` and `i` if `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise it remains an empty list, `max_segment` is a list containing the first element of `arr` and 0, `segments_variants` is an empty list.***
