Output State: **`bets` is 0, `a` is a list of integers where each element is the square root of `prod`, `sumo` is equal to the sum of the initial value of `sumo` and the sum of the square roots of `prod` for each iteration, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `T` is 1, `l` has at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `g` is the least common multiple of `l[0]` and 1, stdin contains no input**

In this output state, the value of `g` has been updated to be the least common multiple of `l[0]` and 1, which is equivalent to `l[0]` since 1 is a factor of every integer. The other variables remain unchanged.
