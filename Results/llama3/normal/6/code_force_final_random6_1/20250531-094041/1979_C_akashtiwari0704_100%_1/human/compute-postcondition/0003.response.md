According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `l`. If `l` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `T` is 0, and `g` is 1. These states do not ensure that the loop will execute, so they need to be adjusted to `l` has at least 1 element and `i` is now 0.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `T` is 0, `g` is 1, `l` has at least 1 element, `i` is 0**
