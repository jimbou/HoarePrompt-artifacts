Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where each value is the least common multiple of all elements in `a` divided by the original value of that element, `sumo` is the original value of `sumo` plus the sum of the least common multiple of all elements in `a` divided by each original value of the elements in `a`, `i` is 0, `prod` is the least common multiple of all elements in `a`, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `T` is 1, `l` has at least 1 element, `g` is the least common multiple of all elements in `l`, `ans` is a string containing the first element of `a` as a string followed by a space, `bets` is an integer greater than 0, and `sumo` is less than `prod`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to include the first element of `a` as a string followed by a space. The other variables remain unchanged.
