State: **a is a list of integers where the value at index i+1 is now prod divided by the original value of a[i+1], sumo is the original value of sumo plus the new value of a[i+1], i is 1, prod is the least common multiple of all elements in a, t is an integer greater than 0, T is 1, l has at least 1 element, g is the least common multiple of all elements in l, stdin contains no input, bets is at least 2**
