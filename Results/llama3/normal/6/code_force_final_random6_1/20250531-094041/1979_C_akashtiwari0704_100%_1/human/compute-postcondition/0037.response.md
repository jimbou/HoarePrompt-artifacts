Output State: **`bets` is 0, `a` is a list of integers where each element is the square root of `prod`, `sumo` is equal to the sum of the initial value of `sumo` and the sum of the square roots of `prod` for each iteration, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `T` is 1, `l` has at least 1 element, `i` is either `bets-1` or `bets`, `g` is 1, stdin contains no input.**

The value of `g` has been changed to 1, and the other variables remain unchanged. The least common multiple of the initial value of `g` and all elements of `l` is no longer valid for `g` since it has been reassigned to 1.
