Functionality: **This function calculates and returns the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in a given list `l`. It takes no explicit parameters other than the list `l` and returns the LCM of its elements. The function assumes that the list `l` has at least one element and that the input list is not empty. The function does not modify the input list or any other variables. It solely computes and returns the LCM of the elements in the list.**
