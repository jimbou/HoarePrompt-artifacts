Postcondition: **The program has executed the if-else block, resulting in one of two possible outcomes. If the sum of the least common multiple of all elements in list `a` divided by each element (`sumo`) is greater than or equal to the least common multiple of all elements in `a` (`prod`), then -1 is printed. Otherwise, if `sumo` is less than `prod`, a string `ans` containing all elements of `a` separated by spaces is printed. In both cases, the values of `bets`, `i`, `a`, `sumo`, `prod`, `T`, `t`, `l`, and `g` remain unchanged, with `bets` and `i` being 0, `a` being a list of integers where each element is the least common multiple of all elements in `a` divided by the original element, `sumo` and `prod` being the sum and least common multiple of all elements in `a` respectively, `T` being 2, `t` being an integer greater than 0, `l` having at least 1 element, and `g` being the least common multiple of all elements in `l`. Additionally, `stdin` contains no input.**
