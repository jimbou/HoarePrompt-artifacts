Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where each value is the least common multiple of all elements in `a` divided by the original value of that element, `sumo` is the original value of `sumo` plus the sum of the least common multiple of all elements in `a` divided by each original value of the elements in `a`, `i` is 0, `prod` is the least common multiple of all elements in `a`, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `T` is 2, `l` has at least 1 element, `g` is the least common multiple of `g` and `l[i]`, and `bets` is an integer, and stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `g` has been updated to be the least common multiple of its original value and the value of `l[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that the value of `l[i]` is not explicitly given, but it is known to be an element of the list `l`, which has at least one element.
