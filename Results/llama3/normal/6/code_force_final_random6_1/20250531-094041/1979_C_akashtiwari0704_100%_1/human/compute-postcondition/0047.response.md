Output State: **bets is an integer, a is a list of integers, prod is the least common multiple of all elements in a, sumo is 0, t is an integer greater than 0, T is 1, l has at least 1 element, i is either bets-1 or bets, g is the least common multiple of all elements in l, stdin contains no input.**

This output state reflects the combined effect of all lines in the code block. The first line assigns an integer value from stdin to `bets`. The second line assigns a list of integers from stdin to `a`. The third line assigns the least common multiple of all elements in `a` to `prod`. The fourth line initializes `sumo` to 0. The values of `t`, `T`, `l`, `i`, and `g` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. Stdin is left empty after the inputs are read.
