Output State: **bets is an integer, a is a list of integers, prod is the least common multiple of all elements in a, sumo is 0, t is an integer greater than 0, T is 0, l has at least 1 element, i is len(l)-1, g is the least common multiple of the initial value of g and all elements of l, stdin contains no input.**

The code first assigns an integer value from stdin to `bets`, leaving stdin with one less input. Then, it assigns a list of integers from stdin to `a`, emptying stdin. The third line assigns the least common multiple of all elements in `a` to `prod`, using the `lcm` function. The fourth line initializes `sumo` to 0. The values of `t`, `T`, `l`, `i`, and `g` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code.
