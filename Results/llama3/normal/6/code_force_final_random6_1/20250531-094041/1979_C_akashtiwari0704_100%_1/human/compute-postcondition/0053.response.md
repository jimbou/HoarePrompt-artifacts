Output State: **a is a list of integers where the value at index i+1 is now prod divided by the original value of a[i+1], a[2] is prod divided by the original value of a[2], sumo is the original value of sumo plus prod divided by the original value of a[2], i is 2, prod is the least common multiple of all elements in a, t is an integer greater than 0, T is 1, l has at least 1 element, g is the least common multiple of all elements in l, stdin contains no input, bets is at least 3**

In this output state, the value of `a[2]` has been updated to be `prod` divided by the original value of `a[2]`. The value of `sumo` has also been updated to be the original value of `sumo` plus the new value of `a[2]`, which is `prod` divided by the original value of `a[2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
