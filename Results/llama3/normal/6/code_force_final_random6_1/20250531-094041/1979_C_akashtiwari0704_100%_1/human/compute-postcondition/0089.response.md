Output State: **bets is 0, i is bets, a is a list of integers where each element is the least common multiple of all elements in a divided by the original element, sumo is the sum of the least common multiple of all elements in a divided by each element, prod is the least common multiple of all elements in a, T is 2, t is an integer greater than 0, l has at least 1 element, g is the least common multiple of all elements in l, stdin contains no input.**

This output state means that after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `bets` will be 0, `i` will be equal to the initial value of `bets`, the list `a` will contain the least common multiple of all its elements divided by each original element, `sumo` will be the sum of these divisions, and the other variables will remain unchanged.
