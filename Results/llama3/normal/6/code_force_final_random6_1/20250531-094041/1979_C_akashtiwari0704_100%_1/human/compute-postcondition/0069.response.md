Postcondition: ***a is a list of integers where each value is the least common multiple of all elements in a divided by the original value of that element, sumo is the original value of sumo plus the sum of the least common multiple of all elements in a divided by each original value of the elements in a, i is bets-1, prod is the least common multiple of all elements in a, t is an integer greater than 0, T is 1, l has at least 1 element, g is the least common multiple of all elements in l, stdin contains no input, bets is an integer. If sumo is greater than or equal to prod, -1 is printed. Otherwise, sumo is less than prod and the string ans containing all elements of a as strings separated by spaces is printed.***
