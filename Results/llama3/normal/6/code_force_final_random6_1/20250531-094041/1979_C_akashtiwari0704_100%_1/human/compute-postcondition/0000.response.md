The code accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). The second line contains n integers k_1,k_2,…,k_n (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20). The first line of the first test case is accepted and assigned to `t`. The stdin now contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). The second line contains n integers k_1,k_2,…,k_n (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) and the first line of the first test case is removed from stdin.
Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 50), stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). The second line contains n integers k_1,k_2,…,k_n (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20)**
