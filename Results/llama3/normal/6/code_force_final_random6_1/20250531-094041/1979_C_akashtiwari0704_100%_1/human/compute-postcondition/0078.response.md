Output State: `a` is a list of integers where each value is the least common multiple of all elements in `a` divided by the original value of that element, `sumo` is the original value of `sumo` plus the sum of the least common multiple of all elements in `a` divided by each original value of the elements in `a`, `i` is `len(l)-1`, `prod` is the least common multiple of all elements in `a`, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `T` is 2, `l` has at least 1 element, `g` is the least common multiple of all elements in `l`, and `bets` is an integer, and stdin contains no input.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the variable `i`, which is now `len(l)-1`, and the variable `g`, which is now the least common multiple of all elements in `l`. The other variables remain unchanged.
