Output State: **`bets` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers where each element is the least common multiple of all elements in `a` divided by the original element, `sumo` is the sum of the least common multiple of all elements in `a` divided by each element, `prod` is the least common multiple of all elements in `a`, `T` is 2, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `l` has at least 1 element, `g` is the least common multiple of all elements in `l`, `ans` is an empty string, and `sumo` is less than `prod`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `ans` which is an empty string. All other variables remain unchanged.
