The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and l, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `l`. If `i` is less than `len(l)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `l` has at least 1 element. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `l` must have at least 2 elements.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `T` is 0, `g` is the least common multiple of the initial value of `g` and the first two elements of `l`, `l` has at least 2 elements, `i` is 2**
