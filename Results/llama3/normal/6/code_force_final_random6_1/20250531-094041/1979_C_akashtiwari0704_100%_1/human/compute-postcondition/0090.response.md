Postcondition: ***bets is 0, i is 0, a is a list of integers where each element is the least common multiple of all elements in a divided by the original element, sumo is the sum of the least common multiple of all elements in a divided by each element, prod is the least common multiple of all elements in a, T is 2, t is an integer greater than 0, l has at least 1 element, g is the least common multiple of all elements in l, stdin contains no input. The current value of sumo is greater than or equal to the current value of prod.***
