Output State: **bets is greater than 0, a is a list of integers where the element at index i is prod // a[i], prod is the least common multiple of all elements in a, sumo is equal to the sum of the initial value of sumo and the value of a[i] after the first line of code, t is an integer greater than 0, T is 0, l has at least 1 element, i is 0, g is the least common multiple of the initial value of g and all elements of l, stdin contains no input**

In this output state, the value of `a[i]` has been updated to `prod // a[i]`, and the value of `sumo` has been incremented by the new value of `a[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
