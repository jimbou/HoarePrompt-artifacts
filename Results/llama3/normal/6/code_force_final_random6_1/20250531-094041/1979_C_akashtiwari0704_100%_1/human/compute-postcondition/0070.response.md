The only variable in the loop head is variable T, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable T and t. If T is less than t, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, T is 1, t is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, T must be increased by 1.
State: **a is a list of integers where each value is the least common multiple of all elements in a divided by the original value of that element, sumo is the original value of sumo plus the sum of the least common multiple of all elements in a divided by each original value of the elements in a, i is bets-1, prod is the least common multiple of all elements in a, t is an integer greater than 0, T is 2, l has at least 1 element, g is the least common multiple of all elements in l, stdin contains no input, bets is an integer.**
