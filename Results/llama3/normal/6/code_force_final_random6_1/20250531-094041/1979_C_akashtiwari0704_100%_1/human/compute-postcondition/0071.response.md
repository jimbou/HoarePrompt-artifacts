Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where each value is the least common multiple of all elements in `a` divided by the original value of that element, `sumo` is the original value of `sumo` plus the sum of the least common multiple of all elements in `a` divided by each original value of the elements in `a`, `i` is `bets-1`, `prod` is the least common multiple of all elements in `a`, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `T` is 2, `l` has at least 1 element, `g` is 1, `bets` is an integer, and stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `a` contains integers that are the result of dividing the least common multiple of all elements in `a` by each original value. The variable `sumo` has been updated to include the sum of these divisions. The value of `i` is one less than `bets`. The variable `prod` is the least common multiple of all elements in `a`. The variable `t` is a positive integer, and `T` is 2. The list `l` has at least one element. The variable `g` has been reset to 1. The value of `bets` remains unchanged, and there is no input in stdin.
