Output State: **`bets` is 0, `a` is a list of integers where each element is the square root of `prod`, `sumo` is equal to the sum of the initial value of `sumo` and the sum of the square roots of `prod` for each iteration, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `T` is 0, `l` has at least 1 element, `i` is `bets-1`, `g` is the least common multiple of the initial value of `g` and all elements of `l`, `ans` is an empty string, and `sumo` is less than `prod`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `bets`, `a`, `sumo`, `t`, `T`, `l`, `i`, and `g` remain unchanged. A new variable `ans` is introduced and assigned an empty string value. The condition that `sumo` is less than `prod` still holds true.
