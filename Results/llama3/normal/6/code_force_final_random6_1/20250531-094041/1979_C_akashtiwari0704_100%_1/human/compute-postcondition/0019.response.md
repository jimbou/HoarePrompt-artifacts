Output State: **bets is greater than 2, a is a list of integers where the element at index i is the square root of prod, sumo is equal to the sum of the initial value of sumo and the square root of prod, t is an integer greater than 0, T is 0, l has at least 1 element, i is 2, g is the least common multiple of the initial value of g and all elements of l, stdin contains no input**

In this final state, the value of `a[i]` has been updated to be the square root of `prod`, which is the least common multiple of all elements in `a`. The value of `sumo` has been incremented by the square root of `prod`. All other variables remain unchanged.
