Output State: **bets is at least 1, i is 0, a is a list of integers where the first element is the least common multiple of all elements in a divided by the original first element, sumo is the least common multiple of all elements in a divided by the original first element, prod is the least common multiple of all elements in a, T is 2, t is an integer greater than 0, l has at least 1 element, g is the least common multiple of all elements in l, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `a[i]` has been modified to be the least common multiple of all elements in `a` divided by the original value of `a[i]`. The value of `sumo` has been incremented by the new value of `a[i]`, which is the least common multiple of all elements in `a` divided by the original value of `a[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
