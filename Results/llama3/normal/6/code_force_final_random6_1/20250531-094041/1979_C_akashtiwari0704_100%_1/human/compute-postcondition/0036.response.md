To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `T` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `T` is less than `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `T` is 0, and `t` is an integer greater than 0. To execute the loop again, `T` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`bets` is 0, `a` is a list of integers where each element is the square root of `prod`, `sumo` is equal to the sum of the initial value of `sumo` and the sum of the square roots of `prod` for each iteration, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `T` is 1, `l` has at least 1 element, `i` is either `bets-1` or `bets`, `g` is the least common multiple of the initial value of `g` and all elements of `l`, stdin contains no input.**
