Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 50), stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). The second line contains n integers k_1,k_2,…,k_n (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20)
Code of the loop:
for T in range(t):

    def lcm(l):
        g = 1
        for i in range(len(l)):
            g = g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])
        return g
    bets = int(input())
    a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    prod = lcm(a)
    sumo = 0
    for i in range(bets):
        a[i] = prod // a[i]
        sumo += int(a[i])
    if sumo >= prod:
        print(-1)
    else:
        ans = ''
        for i in range(bets):
            ans += str(a[i]) + ' '
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `bets` is 0, `a` is a list of integers where each element is the square root of `prod`, `sumo` is equal to the sum of the initial value of `sumo` and the sum of the square roots of `prod` for each iteration, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `T` is 0, `l` has at least 1 element, `i` is either `bets-1` or `bets`, `g` is the least common multiple of the initial value of `g` and all elements of `l`, stdin contains no input. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, `bets` is equal to the initial value of `bets`, and a string containing all elements of `a` followed by a space is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *a is a list of integers where each value is the least common multiple of all elements in a divided by the original value of that element, sumo is the original value of sumo plus the sum of the least common multiple of all elements in a divided by each original value of the elements in a, i is bets-1, prod is the least common multiple of all elements in a, t is an integer greater than 0, T is 1, l has at least 1 element, g is the least common multiple of all elements in l, stdin contains no input, bets is an integer. If sumo is greater than or equal to prod, -1 is printed. Otherwise, sumo is less than prod and the string ans containing all elements of a as strings separated by spaces is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The program has executed the if-else block, resulting in one of two possible outcomes. If the sum of the least common multiple of all elements in list `a` divided by each element (`sumo`) is greater than or equal to the least common multiple of all elements in `a` (`prod`), then -1 is printed. Otherwise, if `sumo` is less than `prod`, a string `ans` containing all elements of `a` separated by spaces is printed. In both cases, the values of `bets`, `i`, `a`, `sumo`, `prod`, `T`, `t`, `l`, and `g` remain unchanged, with `bets` and `i` being 0, `a` being a list of integers where each element is the least common multiple of all elements in `a` divided by the original element, `sumo` and `prod` being the sum and least common multiple of all elements in `a` respectively, `T` being 2, `t` being an integer greater than 0, `l` having at least 1 element, and `g` being the least common multiple of all elements in `l`. Additionally, `stdin` contains no input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
