Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where each element is the square root of `prod`, `sumo` is equal to the sum of the initial value of `sumo` and the sum of the square roots of `prod` for each iteration, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `T` is 0, `l` has at least 1 element, `i` is 2, `g` is the least common multiple of the initial value of `g` and all elements of `l`, `ans` is a string containing the first two elements of `a` followed by a space, `bets` is greater than 1, and `sumo` is less than `prod`.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented to 2, and the string `ans` now contains the first two elements of `a` followed by a space. All other variables remain unchanged.
