Based on the precondition, the `print(ans)` statement will print a string containing all elements of `a` followed by a space.

Since `a` is a list of integers where each element is the square root of `prod`, the output will be a string of square roots of `prod` separated by spaces.

Output: **a string of square roots of prod separated by spaces (where prod is the value of prod)**
