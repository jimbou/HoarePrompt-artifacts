The code prints 'Yes' if the value of `a` is greater than or equal to the value of `s`, otherwise it prints 'No'. 

Where `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, and `s` is an integer between `x+1` and `x+30`, and `x` is at least 1.

Output: **Yes if a is greater than or equal to s, otherwise No (where a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, and s is an integer between x+1 and x+30, and x is at least 1)**
