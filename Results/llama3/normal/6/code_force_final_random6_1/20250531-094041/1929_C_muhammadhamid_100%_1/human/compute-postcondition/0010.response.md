Output: **k is an integer between 2 and 30, x is 0, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, s is either x + x // (k - 1) + 1 (when k is between 3 and 30) or x + x // (k - 1) + 1 (when k is 2), _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 sets of three space-separated integers, i is x - 1, and 'Yes' is printed if a is greater than or equal to s, otherwise 'No' is printed**
