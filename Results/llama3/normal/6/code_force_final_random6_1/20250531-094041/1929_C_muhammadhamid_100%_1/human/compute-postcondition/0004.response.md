To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `x`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `x` is an integer between 1 and 100.

To execute the loop again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `x` remains the same, but since `i` is now 1, `x` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `x` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `s` is either 2 (when `k` is between 3 and 30) or 3 (when `k` is 2), `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` sets of three space-separated integers, `i` is 1**
