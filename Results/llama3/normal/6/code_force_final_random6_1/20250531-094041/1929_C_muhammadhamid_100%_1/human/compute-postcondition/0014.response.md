Output State: **`k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `x` is at least 1, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `s` is between 2 and 31, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` sets of three space-separated integers, `i` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to be between 2 and 31, as it was initially 1 and then incremented by `s // (k - 1) + 1`, where `k` is an integer between 2 and 30. The other variables remain unchanged.
