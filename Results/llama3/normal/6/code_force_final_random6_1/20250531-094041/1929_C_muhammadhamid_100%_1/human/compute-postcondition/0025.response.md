Output State: **`k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `x` is at least 1, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `s` is at least 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` sets of three space-separated integers, `i` is 0**

The value of `s` is increased by `s // (k - 1) + 1`, where `s` is initially 1 and `k` is an integer between 2 and 30. Since `k` is at least 2, `k - 1` is at least 1, and `s // (k - 1)` is at least 1. Therefore, `s` is increased by at least 2. The values of the other variables are not affected.
