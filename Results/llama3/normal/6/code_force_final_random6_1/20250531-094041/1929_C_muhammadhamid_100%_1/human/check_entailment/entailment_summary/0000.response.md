Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It accurately implements the strategy described in the problem statement. The variable `s` is calculated based on the number of times Sasha can lose in a row (`x`) and the multiplier for winning (`k`). The program then checks if Sasha's initial amount of coins (`a`) is sufficient to guarantee winning any number of coins. If `a` is greater than or equal to `s`, it prints 'Yes', indicating that Sasha can achieve the desired outcome. Otherwise, it prints 'No'. The program correctly handles all test cases provided in the input.

Correctness: **True**
