To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.

The only object in the loop head that can be adjusted is the variable `_`, which is the loop counter. The `range` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 0 up to but not including the value returned by `int(input())`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 0, and `stdin` contains `t-1` sets of three space-separated integers. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1, and `stdin` must contain one less set of three space-separated integers.

State: **k is an integer between 2 and 30, x is 0, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, s is either x + x // (k - 1) + 1 (when k is between 3 and 30) or x + x // (k - 1) + 1 (when k is 2), _ is 1, stdin contains t-2 sets of three space-separated integers, i is x - 1**
