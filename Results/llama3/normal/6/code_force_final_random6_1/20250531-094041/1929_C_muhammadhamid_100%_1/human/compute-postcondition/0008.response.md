Output State: **k is an integer between 2 and 30, x is 0, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, s is either x + x // (k - 1) + 1 (when k is between 3 and 30) or x + x // (k - 1) + 1 (when k is 2), _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 sets of three space-separated integers, i is x - 1**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

* The value of `k` remains unchanged, still an integer between 2 and 30.
* The value of `x` is now 0, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
* The value of `a` remains unchanged, still an integer between 1 and 10^9.
* The value of `s` has been updated according to the loop's body, and its final value depends on the value of `k`. If `k` is between 3 and 30, `s` is equal to `x + x // (k - 1) + 1`. If `k` is 2, `s` is equal to `x + x // (k - 1) + 1`.
* The value of `_` remains unchanged, still 0.
* The contents of `stdin` remain unchanged, still containing `t-1` sets of three space-separated integers.
* The value of `i` is now `x - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
