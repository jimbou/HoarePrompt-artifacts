Output State: **`k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `x` is at least 2, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `s` is between 4 and 33, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` sets of three space-separated integers, `i` is 2**

The value of `s` is updated by adding the result of the expression `s // (k - 1) + 1` to its current value. Since `s` is between 3 and 32, and `k` is between 2 and 30, the value of `s // (k - 1)` is between 1 and 16. Therefore, the new value of `s` is between 4 and 33. The values of the other variables are not affected.
