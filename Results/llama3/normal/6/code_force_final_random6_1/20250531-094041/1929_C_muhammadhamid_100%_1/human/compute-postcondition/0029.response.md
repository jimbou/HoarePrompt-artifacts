Output State: **`k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `x` is at least 3, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `s` is at least 2 + (s // (k - 1) + 1) + (s // (k - 1) + 1), `stdin` contains `t-3` sets of three space-separated integers, `i` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to be at least 2 + (s // (k - 1) + 1) + (s // (k - 1) + 1), which is the result of adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` to the original value of `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.
