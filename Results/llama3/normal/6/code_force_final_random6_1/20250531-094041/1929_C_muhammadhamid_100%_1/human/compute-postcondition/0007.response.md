Output State: **`k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `x` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `s` is either 3 + 3 // (k - 1) + 1 (when `k` is between 3 and 30) or 4 + 4 // (k - 1) + 1 (when `k` is 2), `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` sets of three space-separated integers, `i` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated based on the value of `k`. If `k` is between 3 and 30, `s` is now 3 plus the integer division of 3 by `k-1` plus 1. If `k` is 2, `s` is now 4 plus the integer division of 4 by `k-1` plus 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
