The code prints 'Yes' if the value of `a` is greater than or equal to the value of `s`, otherwise it prints 'No'. 

The value of `s` depends on the value of `k`. If `k` is between 3 and 30, `s` is equal to `x + x // (k - 1) + 1`, otherwise `s` is equal to `x + x // (k - 1) + 1`. 

Since `x` is 0, `s` will be 1 regardless of the value of `k`. 

The value of `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9.

Output: **Yes if a is greater than or equal to 1, otherwise No**
