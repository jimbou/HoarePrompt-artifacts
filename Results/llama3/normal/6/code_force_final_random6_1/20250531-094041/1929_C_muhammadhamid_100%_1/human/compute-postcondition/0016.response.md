Output State: **`k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `x` is at least 1, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `s` is between 3 and 32, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` sets of three space-separated integers, `i` is 1**

The value of `s` is updated by adding the result of the expression `s // (k - 1) + 1` to its current value. Since `s` is initially between 2 and 31, and `k` is between 2 and 30, the value of `s // (k - 1)` will be at least 1 and at most 31. Therefore, the new value of `s` will be between 3 and 32. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
