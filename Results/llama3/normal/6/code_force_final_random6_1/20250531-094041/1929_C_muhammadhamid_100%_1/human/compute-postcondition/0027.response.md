Output State: **`k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `x` is at least 2, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `s` is at least 2 + (s // (k - 1) + 1), `stdin` contains `t-3` sets of three space-separated integers, `i` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated by adding the result of the expression `s // (k - 1) + 1` to its original value. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The expression `s // (k - 1) + 1` calculates the integer division of `s` by `k-1` and adds 1 to the result. Since `k` is an integer between 2 and 30, the value of `k-1` is between 1 and 29. Therefore, the value of `s // (k - 1)` is at least 1, and the value of `s // (k - 1) + 1` is at least 2. As a result, the value of `s` is increased by at least 2.
