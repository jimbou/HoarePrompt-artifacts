To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `x`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `x`. If `x` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `i` is initialized to `x - 1`, we need to adjust `x` to be at least 1.

State: **`k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `x` is at least 1, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `s` is 1, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` sets of three space-separated integers, `i` is 0**
