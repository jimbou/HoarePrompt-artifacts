Based on the precondition, we can analyze the code as follows:

* `k` is an integer between 2 and 30.
* `x` is at least `x`, which means `x` is a non-negative integer.
* `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9.
* `s` is at least 2 + (x-1) * (s // (k - 1) + 1), which is a complex expression involving `x`, `k`, and `s`.
* `stdin` contains t-3 sets of three space-separated integers, but this information is not relevant to the print statement.
* `i` is x-1, which means `i` is one less than `x`.

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print('Yes' if a >= s else 'No')`

This statement prints 'Yes' if the condition `a >= s` is true, and 'No' otherwise.

Based on the precondition, we know that `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, and `s` is at least 2 + (x-1) * (s // (k - 1) + 1). However, we cannot determine the exact values of `a` and `s` without more information.

Therefore, the output of the print statement depends on the values of `a` and `s`, which are not fully specified. However, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **'Yes' if a is greater than or equal to s, 'No' otherwise (where a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, and s is at least 2 + (x-1) * (s // (k - 1) + 1))**
