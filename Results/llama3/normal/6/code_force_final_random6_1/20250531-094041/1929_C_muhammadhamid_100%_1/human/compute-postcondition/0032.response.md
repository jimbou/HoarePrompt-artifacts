The code prints 'Yes' if the value of `a` is greater than or equal to the value of `s`, otherwise it prints 'No'. Here, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, and `s` is at least 2 + (x-1) * (s // (k - 1) + 1), where x is at least x, and k is an integer between 2 and 30.
Output: **k is an integer between 2 and 30, x is at least x, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, s is at least 2 + (x-1) * (s // (k - 1) + 1), stdin contains t-3 sets of three space-separated integers, i is x-1, and either 'Yes' or 'No' is printed depending on whether a is greater than or equal to s**
