Output State: **k is an integer between 2 and 30, x is at least x, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, s is at least 2 + (x-1) * (s // (k - 1) + 1), stdin contains t-3 sets of three space-separated integers, i is x-1**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `k` remains unchanged, `x` is still at least `x`, `a` is still an integer between 1 and 10^9, `s` has increased by at least `(x-1)` times the value of `(s // (k - 1) + 1)`, `stdin` still contains `t-3` sets of three space-separated integers, and `i` has reached `x-1`.
