Output State: **k is an integer between 2 and 30, x is at least x, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, s is at least 2 + (x-1) * (s // (k - 1) + 1), stdin contains 0 sets of three space-separated integers, i is x-1, and either 'Yes' or 'No' is printed depending on whether a is greater than or equal to s.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `k` will still be an integer between 2 and 30, `x` will be at least as large as its initial value, `a` will still be an integer between 1 and 10^9, and `s` will be at least as large as the value it had after the third iteration of the loop. Additionally, `stdin` will be empty, `i` will be equal to `x-1`, and either 'Yes' or 'No' will be printed depending on whether `a` is greater than or equal to `s`.
