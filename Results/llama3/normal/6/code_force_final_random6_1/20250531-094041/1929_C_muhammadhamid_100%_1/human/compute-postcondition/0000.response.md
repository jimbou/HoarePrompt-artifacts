The only objects in the loop head are variables  _ and stdin, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the stdin.  If the stdin contains at least 1 integer the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000). So for the loop to be executed  the stdin must have at least 1 integer and the _ is 0.
State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t sets of three space-separated integers k, x, and a (2 <= k <= 30, 1 <= x <= 100, 1 <= a <= 10^9), _ is 0**
