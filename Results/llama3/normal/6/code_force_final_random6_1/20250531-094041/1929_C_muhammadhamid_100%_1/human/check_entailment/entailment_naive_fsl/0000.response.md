Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the strategy described in the problem statement. It calculates the minimum amount of coins Sasha needs to have in order to guarantee that he can win any number of coins. The calculation is done by simulating the worst-case scenario where Sasha loses x times in a row, and then wins once. The amount of coins Sasha needs to have is the sum of the coins he needs to place as bets in each of the x+1 rounds.

The program correctly handles all possible inputs, including edge cases such as when k=2, x=1, and a=1, where Sasha cannot guarantee that he can win any number of coins.

The program also correctly handles cases where k is large, x is large, and a is large, where the calculation of the minimum amount of coins Sasha needs to have is correct.

Overall, the program correctly implements the strategy described in the problem statement and handles all possible inputs correctly.
