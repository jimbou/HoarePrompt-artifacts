Output State: **`k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `x` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `s` is either 3 (when `k` is between 3 and 30) or 4 (when `k` is 2), `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` sets of three space-separated integers, `i` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated based on the value of `k`. If `k` is between 3 and 30, `s` is now 3. If `k` is 2, `s` is now 4. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
