Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers: k, x, and a. It calculates a value s based on k and x, and then prints 'Yes' if a is greater than or equal to s, and 'No' otherwise. The function processes all test cases provided in the input and prints the corresponding results.**
