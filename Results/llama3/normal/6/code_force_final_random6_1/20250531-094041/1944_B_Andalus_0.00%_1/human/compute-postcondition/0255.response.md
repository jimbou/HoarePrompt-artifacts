The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `T`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `T`. If `_` is less than `T`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `T` is a positive integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `T` must be greater than 2.
State: **`_` is 2, T is a positive integer greater than 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is n - 1, ldb is a list containing all elements from lft that appear consecutively more than once, sng is a list containing all elements from lft that appear only once, rdb is a list containing all elements from rgt that appear consecutively more than once, elem is the last element in the list sng, and sz is equal to the minimum of k and twice the length of rdb.**
