Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is n - 1, ldb is a list containing all elements from lft that appear consecutively more than once, sng is a list containing at least three elements from lft that appear only once, rdb is a list containing all elements from rgt that appear consecutively more than once, sz is the minimum of k and twice the length of ldb plus three, and elem is the third element in the list sng. If sz is greater than or equal to k, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the third element of the list sng which is elem is printed**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of sz has been incremented by 1. The value of sz is now the minimum of k and twice the length of ldb plus three. All other variables remain unchanged.
