Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: _ is 2, T is a positive integer greater than 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is n - 1, ldb is an empty list, sng is an empty list, rdb is an empty list, elem is not defined, and sz is not defined.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if lft[i] == lft[i - 1]:
        ldb.append(lft[i])
    elif i < n - 1 and lft[i] != lft[i + 1]:
        sng.append(lft[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *_ is 2, T is a positive integer greater than 2, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 1. If lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], then ldb is a list containing one integer equal to lft[1], sng is an empty list, rdb is an empty list, elem is not defined, and sz is not defined. If lft[i] is not equal to lft[i - 1], then ldb is an empty list, rdb is an empty list, elem is not defined, and sz is not defined. If i is less than n - 1 and the element at index i in lft is not equal to the element at index i + 1 in lft, then sng is a list containing the element at index i in lft. Otherwise, sng is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The program's state is updated based on the comparison of the third and fourth elements of the sorted list `lft`. If the third element is equal to the fourth element, a new list `ldb` is created containing the third element of `lft`. Otherwise, if `i` is less than `n - 1` and the third element is not equal to the fourth element, a new list `sng` is created with the third element of `lft` as its only element. In all cases, the values of `_`, `T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, and `stdin` remain unchanged, and `i` remains 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`_`, `T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `rgt`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. `i` is 3. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` has an additional element which is the value of `lft` at index 3. Otherwise, if `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` has an additional element at the end which is `lft[3]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
