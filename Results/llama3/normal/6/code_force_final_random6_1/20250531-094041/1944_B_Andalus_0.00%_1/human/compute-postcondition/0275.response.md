Output State: **_ is 2, T is a positive integer greater than 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is n - 1, ldb is a list of integers that are equal to the consecutive duplicate elements in lft, sng is a list of integers that are equal to the single elements in lft, rdb is an empty list, elem is not defined, and sz is not defined.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows: The values of `_`, `T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `rgt`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is now `n - 1`. The list `ldb` contains all the consecutive duplicate elements in `lft`, and the list `sng` contains all the single elements in `lft`. The lists `rdb`, `elem`, and `sz` remain empty and undefined, respectively.
