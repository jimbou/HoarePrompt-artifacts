Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n - 1, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers that appear consecutively in `lft` more than once and is not empty, `sng` is a list containing all the integers that appear only once in `lft` and are not equal to the integer at the next index in `lft`, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers that appear consecutively in `rgt` more than once, `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `elem` is the first element in `ldb`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with all variables retaining their original values and properties. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, but this does not affect the values of the variables.
