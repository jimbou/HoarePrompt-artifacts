Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n - 1, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers that appear consecutively in `lft` more than once, `sng` is a list containing all the integers that appear only once in `lft` and are not equal to the integer at the next index in `lft` and must have at least the minimum of `k` and twice the number of elements in `ldb` elements, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers that appear consecutively in `rgt` more than once and must have at least 2 elements, `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `elem` is the second element in `rdb`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code executes a break statement, which means we exit the innermost loop or if statement we were directly inside. The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement. All the preconditions are still valid after the code has been executed, and no new variables are introduced.
