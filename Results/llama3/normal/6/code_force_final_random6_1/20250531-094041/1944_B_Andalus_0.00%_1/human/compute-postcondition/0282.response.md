Postcondition: **The program's state remains unchanged if `rgt[i]` is not equal to `rgt[i - 1]`. If `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, then `rdb` is updated to contain one integer which is equal to the current value of `rgt[i]` which is also equal to the current value of `rgt[i - 1]`. All other variables retain their original values and properties as specified in the precondition.**
