Output State: **`_` remains unchanged, `T` remains unchanged, `n` must be greater than 3, `k` remains unchanged, `lst` remains unchanged, `lft` remains unchanged, `rgt` remains unchanged, `stdin` remains unchanged, `i` is 3, and `sng` has an additional element at the end which is `lft[3]`.**

In this output state, all variables except `sng` remain unchanged. The value of `sng` is updated by appending the value of `lft[i]` to the end, where `i` is 3. This means that the last element of `sng` is now `lft[3]`.
