The only variable in the loop head is variable `elem` and list `rdb`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `rdb`. If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `rdb` has at least 1 integer, `elem` is the first element in the list `rdb`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 integers and the `elem` is the second element in the list.
State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing at least 2 integers, `ldb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, `elem` is the second element in the list `rdb`.**
