Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is an empty list, `ldb` is an empty list, `sz` is `k` if `k` is even and `k - 1` if `k` is odd, and the current value of `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, `sng` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `elem` is the first element in the list `sng`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables `i`, `rdb`, `ldb`, `sz`, `sng`, and `elem` remain unchanged. However, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.
