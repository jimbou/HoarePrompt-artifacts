Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n - 1, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers that appear consecutively in `lft` more than once, `sng` is a list containing all the integers that appear only once in `lft` and are not equal to the integer at the next index in `lft` and must have at least the minimum of `k` and twice the number of elements in `ldb` elements, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers that appear consecutively in `rgt` more than once, `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `elem` is the last element in `rdb`. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, then `sz` is greater than or equal to `k` + 2, and the last element of `rdb` which is `elem` is printed twice, separated by a space. Otherwise, no action is taken.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the variables in the loop head and body have reached their final values. The loop has iterated over all elements in `rdb`, and `sz` has reached a value greater than or equal to `k`. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, the last element of `rdb` is printed twice, separated by a space. Otherwise, no action is taken. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
