The only object in the loop head is variable  elem and list sng, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list sng.  If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, sng has at least 2 elements, elem is the second element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the elem is the third element in the list.
State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n - 1, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers that appear consecutively in lft more than once, `sng` is a list containing all the integers that appear only once in lft and are not equal to the integer at the next index in lft and must have at least 3 elements, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers that appear consecutively in rgt more than once, `sz` is equal to the minimum of k and twice the number of elements in ldb plus two, and `elem` is the third element in sng.**
