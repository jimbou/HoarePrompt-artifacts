Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is n - 1, `ldb` is a list containing all elements from `lft` that appear consecutively more than once and must have at least 3 elements, `sng` is a list containing all elements from `lft` that appear only once, `rdb` is a list containing all elements from `rgt` that appear consecutively more than once, and `elem` is the third element in the list `ldb`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code executes a break statement, which means it exits the innermost loop or if statement it is currently inside. The values of all variables remain unchanged, but the program flow is altered as it breaks out of the loop or if statement.
