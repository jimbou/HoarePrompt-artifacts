Postcondition: **T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is n - 1, ldb is a list containing all elements from lft that appear consecutively more than once, sng is a list containing all elements from lft that appear only once, rdb is a list containing all elements from rgt that appear consecutively more than once and must have at least 1 element, elem is the first element in the list rdb. If k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, sz is increased by 2 and the current value of k minus sz is greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise, no action is taken.**
