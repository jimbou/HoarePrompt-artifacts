Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing at least 2 integers, `ldb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, `elem` is the second element in the list `rdb`, `sz` is increased by 2, the second element of the list `rdb` which is `elem` is printed twice, separated by a space, without starting a new line. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.**

In this output state, the value of `sz` has been increased by 2, and the second element of the list `rdb` has been printed twice, separated by a space, without starting a new line. The values of the other variables remain the same. Additionally, if the new value of `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
