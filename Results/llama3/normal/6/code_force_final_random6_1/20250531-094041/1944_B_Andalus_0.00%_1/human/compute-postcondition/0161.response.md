The only object in the loop head is variable elem and list ldb, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list ldb. If the list has at least 1 element the loop executes. Before the loop starts, ldb is a list containing all elements from lft that appear consecutively more than once. So for the loop to be executed the list ldb must have at least 1 element and elem is the first element in the list.
State: **T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is n - 1, ldb is a list containing all elements from lft that appear consecutively more than once and must have at least 1 element, sng is a list containing all elements from lft that appear only once, rdb is a list containing all elements from rgt that appear consecutively more than once, sz is 0, and elem is the first element in the list ldb**
