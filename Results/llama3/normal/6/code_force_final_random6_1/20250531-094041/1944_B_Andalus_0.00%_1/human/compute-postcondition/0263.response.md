Postcondition: ***_ is 2, T is a positive integer greater than 2, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, ldb is an empty list, rdb is an empty list, elem is not defined, and sz is not defined. The element at index i in lft is not equal to the element at index i-1 in lft. If i is less than n - 1 and the element at index i in lft is not equal to the element at index i + 1 in lft, then sng is a list containing the element at index i in lft. Otherwise, sng is an empty list.***
