Postcondition: **The program's state is updated based on the comparison of the third and fourth elements of the sorted list `lft`. If the third element is equal to the fourth element, a new list `ldb` is created containing the third element of `lft`. Otherwise, if `i` is less than `n - 1` and the third element is not equal to the fourth element, a new list `sng` is created with the third element of `lft` as its only element. In all cases, the values of `_`, `T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, and `stdin` remain unchanged, and `i` remains 2.**
