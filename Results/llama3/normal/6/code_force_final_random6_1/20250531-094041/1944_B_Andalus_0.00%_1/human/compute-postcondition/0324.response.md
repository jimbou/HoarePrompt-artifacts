Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers that are equal to the consecutive duplicate elements in `rgt`, `ldb` is an empty list, `sz` is `k + 2`, `sng` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `elem` is the second element in the list. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the second element of the list `sng` which is `elem` is being printed**

In this output state, the value of `sz` has been incremented by 1, making it `k + 2`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions for breaking out of the loop and printing the second element of the list `sng` still apply.
