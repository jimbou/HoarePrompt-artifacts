Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is an empty list, `ldb` is an empty list, `sz` is `k` if `k` is even and `k - 1` if `k` is odd, `sng` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `elem` is the first element in the list `sng`. If the current value of `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
