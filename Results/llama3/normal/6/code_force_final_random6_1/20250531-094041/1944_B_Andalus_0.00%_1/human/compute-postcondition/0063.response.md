The code prints the first element in the list `sng`, which contains all the integers that appear only once in the sorted list `lft` and are not equal to the integer at the next index in `lft`. This element is printed followed by a space, as indicated by the `end=' '` argument in the `print` function.

Output: **the first element in the list sng (which is an integer that appears only once in lft and is not equal to the next integer in lft), followed by a space**
