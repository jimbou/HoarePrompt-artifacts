Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing at least 1 integer, `ldb` is an empty list, `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, `sng` is an empty list, `elem` is the first element in the list `rdb`, nothing is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code `break` does not change the values of any variables, but it causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional statement it is currently inside. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the additional information that the program has broken out of a loop or conditional statement.
