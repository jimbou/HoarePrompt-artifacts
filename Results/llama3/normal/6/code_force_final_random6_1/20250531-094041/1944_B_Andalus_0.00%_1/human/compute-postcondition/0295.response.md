Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers that are equal to the consecutive duplicate elements in `rgt`, `ldb` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `elem` is the first element in the list, `sz` is increased by 2, and this is printed: elem elem (where elem is the first element in the list ldb). If `sz` is at least `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.**

In this output state, the value of `sz` has been increased by 2, but the values of the other variables remain the same. The condition for breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement is still dependent on whether `sz` is at least `k`. The printed output remains the same, displaying the first element of the list `ldb` twice.
