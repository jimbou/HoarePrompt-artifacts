Postcondition: ***`_`, `T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `rgt`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. `i` is 3. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` has an additional element which is the value of `lft` at index 3. Otherwise, if `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` has an additional element at the end which is `lft[3]`.***
