Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers that are equal to the consecutive duplicate elements in `rgt`, `ldb` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `elem` is the third element in the list, `sz` is increased by 2. If the new value of `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the third element of the list `ldb` which is `elem` is printed twice with a space in between.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `sz` is increased by 2. The other variables remain unchanged. If the new value of `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we exit the innermost loop or if statement and print the third element of the list `ldb` twice with a space in between.
