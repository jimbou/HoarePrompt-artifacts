The code prints the second element in the list `sng`, which contains all the integers that appear only once in the sorted list `lft` and are not equal to the integer at the next index in `lft`, and must have at least 2 elements.
Output: **the second element in sng (which is the second integer that appears only once in lft and is not equal to the integer at the next index in lft)**
