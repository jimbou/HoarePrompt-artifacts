Output State: **_ is 2, T is a positive integer greater than 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is n - 1, ldb is an empty list, sng is an empty list, rdb is an empty list, elem is not defined, and sz is not defined.**

The code block reads two integers from stdin, assigning them to `n` and `k`, respectively. It then reads a list of 2n integers from stdin, assigning it to `lst`. The list is split into two halves, `lft` and `rgt`, each containing n integers. Both `lft` and `rgt` are sorted in ascending order. The lists `ldb`, `rdb`, and `sng` are initialized as empty lists. The variables `elem` and `sz` are not defined in this code block. The value of `i` is not modified in this code block, so it remains `n - 1`. The value of `_` and `T` are not modified in this code block, so they remain the same.
