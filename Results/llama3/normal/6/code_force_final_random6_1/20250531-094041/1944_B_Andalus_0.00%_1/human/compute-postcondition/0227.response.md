The only variable in the loop head is variable elem and list rdb, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list rdb. If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, rdb has at least 2 elements, elem is the second element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the elem is the third element in the list.
State: **T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is n - 1, ldb is a list containing all elements from lft that appear consecutively more than once, sng is a list containing all elements from lft that appear only once, rdb is a list containing all elements from rgt that appear consecutively more than once and must have at least 3 elements, elem is the third element in the list rdb.**
