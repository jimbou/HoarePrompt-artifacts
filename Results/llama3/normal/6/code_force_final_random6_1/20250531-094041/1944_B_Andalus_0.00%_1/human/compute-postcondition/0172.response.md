Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is n - 1, `ldb` is a list containing all elements from `lft` that appear consecutively more than once and must have at least 2 elements, `sng` is a list containing all elements from `lft` that appear only once, `rdb` is a list containing all elements from `rgt` that appear consecutively more than once, and `elem` is the second element in the list `ldb`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
