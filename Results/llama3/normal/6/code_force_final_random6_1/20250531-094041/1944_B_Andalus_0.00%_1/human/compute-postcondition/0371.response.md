Output: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is an empty list, `ldb` is an empty list, `sz` is `k + 1` if `k` is even and `k` if `k` is odd, `sng` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `elem` is the second element in the list `sng`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made, and the second element of the list `sng` which is `elem` is printed**
