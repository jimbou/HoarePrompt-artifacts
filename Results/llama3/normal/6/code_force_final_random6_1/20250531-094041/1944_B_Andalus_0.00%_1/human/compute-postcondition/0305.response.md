Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers that are equal to the consecutive duplicate elements in `rgt`, `ldb` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `elem` is the third element in the list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `i`, `rdb`, `ldb`, and `elem` remain unchanged, as the `break` statement only exits the current loop or if statement without modifying any variables. The condition that `ldb` must have at least 2 elements and `elem` is the third element in the list is still valid.
