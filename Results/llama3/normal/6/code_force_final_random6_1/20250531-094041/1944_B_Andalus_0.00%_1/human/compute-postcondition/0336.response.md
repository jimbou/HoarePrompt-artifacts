To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `elem` and `rdb`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `rdb` list. If `rdb` has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Since `i` is `n - 1`, `ldb` is an empty list, `sz` is 0, `sng` is an empty list, and nothing is printed, these states do not affect the loop's execution. However, we need to adjust the state of `elem` to be the first element in the `rdb` list.

State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing at least 1 integer, `ldb` is an empty list, `sz` is 0, `sng` is an empty list, `elem` is the first element in the list `rdb`, and nothing is printed**
