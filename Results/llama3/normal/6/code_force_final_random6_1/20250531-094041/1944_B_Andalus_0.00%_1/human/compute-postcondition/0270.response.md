To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, n):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3.

The value of `n` remains unchanged, but for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`, which is 3. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 3.

The other variables `_`, `T`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, and `stdin` are not affected by the loop head and remain unchanged.

State: **`_` remains unchanged, `T` remains unchanged, `n` must be greater than 3, `k` remains unchanged, `lst` remains unchanged, `lft` remains unchanged, `rgt` remains unchanged, `stdin` remains unchanged, and `i` is 3**
