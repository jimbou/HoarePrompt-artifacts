The only objects in the loop head are variables  elem and list  sng, so we can only adjust those ones.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list sng.  If the list has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, i is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers that are equal to the consecutive duplicate elements in `rgt`, `ldb` is an empty list, `sz` is `k`. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 element and the elem is the first element in the list.
State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers that are equal to the consecutive duplicate elements in `rgt`, `ldb` is an empty list, `sz` is `k`, sng is a list that must have at least 1 element, elem is the first element in the list**
