Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: _ is 2, T is a positive integer greater than 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is n - 1, ldb is a list of integers that are equal to the consecutive duplicate elements in lft, sng is a list of integers that are equal to the single elements in lft, rdb is an empty list, elem is not defined, and sz is not defined.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if rgt[i] == rgt[i - 1]:
        rdb.append(rgt[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *_ is 2, T is a positive integer greater than 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive and n is greater than 1, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 1, ldb is a list of integers that are equal to the consecutive duplicate elements in lft, sng is a list of integers that are equal to the single elements in lft, if rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rdb is a list containing one integer which is equal to the current value of rgt[i] which is also equal to the current value of rgt[i - 1], otherwise rdb is an empty list, elem is not defined, and sz is not defined.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The program's state remains unchanged if `rgt[i]` is not equal to `rgt[i - 1]`. If `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, then `rdb` is updated to contain one integer which is equal to the current value of `rgt[i]` which is also equal to the current value of `rgt[i - 1]`. All other variables retain their original values and properties as specified in the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`rgt[i]` is not equal to `rgt[i - 1]` or `rdb` contains one integer which is equal to the current value of `rgt[i]` which is also equal to the current value of `rgt[i - 1]`, `i` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than the new value of `i`. If `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, then `rdb` contains two integers: `rgt[i - 1]` and `rgt[i]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
