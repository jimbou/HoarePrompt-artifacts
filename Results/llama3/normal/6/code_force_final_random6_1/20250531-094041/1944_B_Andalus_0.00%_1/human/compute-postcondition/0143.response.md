Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is 3, ldb is a list containing either two or three elements which are equal to the current value of lft[i - 1] or lft[i], sng is a list containing the element at index i in the list lft if i is less than n-1 and lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], otherwise sng is an empty list, rdb is an empty list, sz is not defined, and elem is not defined.**

In this output state, the value of ldb has been updated to include an additional element equal to the current value of lft[i - 1] or lft[i], depending on whether lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1] or not. The other variables remain unchanged.
