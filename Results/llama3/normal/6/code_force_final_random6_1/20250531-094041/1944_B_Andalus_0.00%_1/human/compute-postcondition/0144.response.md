Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing one or two elements which are equal to the current value of `lft[i - 1]`, `rdb` is an empty list, `sz` is not defined, `elem` is not defined, `sng` is a list containing the element at index `i` in the list `lft` and the element at index `i` in the list `lft` (because `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` and `i` is less than `n-1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`), `i` is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `sng` has been updated to include the element at index `i` in the list `lft` because `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` and `i` is less than `n-1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
