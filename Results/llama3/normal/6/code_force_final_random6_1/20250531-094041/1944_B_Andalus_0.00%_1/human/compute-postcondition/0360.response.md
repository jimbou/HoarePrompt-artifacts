To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `elem` and `sng`. 

Since `sng` is an empty list, for the loop to execute, `sng` must have at least one element. 

The state of `elem` is the last element in the list `rdb`, but since `sng` is empty, `elem` should be the first element in `sng` for the loop to execute.

State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is an empty list, `ldb` is an empty list, `sz` is `k` if `k` is even and `k - 1` if `k` is odd, `sng` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `elem` is the first element in the list `sng`**
