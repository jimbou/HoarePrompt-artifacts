Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is n - 1, ldb is an empty list, sng is an empty list, rdb is an empty list, sz is not defined, and elem is not defined.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if lft[i] == lft[i - 1]:
        ldb.append(lft[i])
    elif i < n - 1 and lft[i] != lft[i + 1]:
        sng.append(lft[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is 1, ldb is a list containing one element which is equal to the current value of lft[i - 1] if lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], otherwise ldb is an empty list, sng is a list containing the element at index i in the list lft if i is less than n-1 and the element at index i in the list lft is not equal to the element at index i+1 in the list lft, otherwise sng is an empty list, rdb is an empty list, sz is not defined, and elem is not defined. Additionally, if lft[i] is not equal to lft[i - 1], the element at index i in the list lft is not equal to the element at index i-1 in the list lft.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is 2. If lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], then ldb is a list containing two elements which are equal to the current value of lft[i - 1]. If lft[i] is not equal to lft[i - 1], then ldb is a list containing one element which is equal to the current value of lft[i - 1]. If i is less than n-1 and lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], then sng is a list containing the element at index i in the list lft. Otherwise, sng is an empty list. rdb is an empty list, sz is not defined, and elem is not defined.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is 3. If lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], then ldb is a list containing two or three elements which are equal to the current value of lft[i - 1] or lft[i]. Otherwise, ldb is a list containing one or two elements which are equal to the current value of lft[i - 1]. sng is a list containing the element at index i in the list lft if i is less than n-1 and lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], otherwise sng is an empty list. rdb is an empty list, sz is not defined, and elem is not defined.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
