To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `elem` and `ldb`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `ldb` list. If `ldb` has at least 2 elements, the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `ldb` has at least 1 element, and `elem` is the first element in the list `ldb`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list `ldb` must have at least 2 elements and `elem` is the second element in the list `ldb`.

State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is n - 1, `ldb` is a list containing all elements from `lft` that appear consecutively more than once and must have at least 2 elements, `sng` is a list containing all elements from `lft` that appear only once, `rdb` is a list containing all elements from `rgt` that appear consecutively more than once, and `elem` is the second element in the list `ldb`. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, `sz` is increased by 2. Otherwise, no change occurs.**
