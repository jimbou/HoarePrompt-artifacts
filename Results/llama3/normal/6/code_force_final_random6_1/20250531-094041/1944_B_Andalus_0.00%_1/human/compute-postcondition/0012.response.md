Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 2, `ldb` is a list containing one integer which is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, `rdb` is an empty list, and `sng` is an empty list.**

The code appends the value of `lft[i]` to the list `ldb`. Since `i` is 2, `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[1]`. The list `ldb` now contains one integer which is equal to `lft[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
