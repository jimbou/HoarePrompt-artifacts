Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing at least 1 integer, `ldb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, `elem` is the first element in the list `rdb`, and nothing is printed. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
