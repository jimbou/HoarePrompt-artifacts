The only variable in the loop head is variable `elem` and list `sng`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `sng`. If the list `sng` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, all the other variables are still the same. So for the loop to be executed, the list `sng` must have at least 1 element and `elem` is the first element in the list `sng`.

State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is n - 1, `ldb` is a list containing all elements from `lft` that appear consecutively more than once, `sng` is a list containing at least 1 element of all elements from `lft` that appear only once, `rdb` is a list containing all elements from `rgt` that appear consecutively more than once, `elem` is the first element in the list `sng`, and `sz` is equal to the minimum of `k` and twice the length of `rdb`.**
