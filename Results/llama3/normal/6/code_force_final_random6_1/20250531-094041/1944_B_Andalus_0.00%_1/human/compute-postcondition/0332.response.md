Output State: `i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers that are equal to the consecutive duplicate elements in `rgt`, `ldb` is an empty list, `sz` is `k + len(sng)`, `sng` is an empty list, `elem` is the last element in the list.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state is such that the variable `i` remains unchanged at `n - 1`, the list `rdb` remains unchanged containing all the integers equal to the consecutive duplicate elements in `rgt`, the list `ldb` remains empty, the variable `sz` is incremented by the length of the list `sng` (i.e., `k + len(sng)`), the list `sng` is exhausted (i.e., empty), and the variable `elem` holds the last element of the list `sng` that was processed in the loop.
