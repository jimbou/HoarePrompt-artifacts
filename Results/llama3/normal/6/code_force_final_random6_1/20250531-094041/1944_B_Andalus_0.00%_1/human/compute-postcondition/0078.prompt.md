Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is n - 1, ldb is a list containing all the integers that appear consecutively in lft more than once, sng is a list containing all the integers that appear only once in lft and are not equal to the integer at the next index in lft, rdb is a list containing all the integers that appear consecutively in rgt more than once, and sz is equal to the minimum of k and twice the number of elements in ldb.
Code of the loop:
for elem in sng:
    if sz >= k:
        break
    print(elem, end=' ')
    sz += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n - 1, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers that appear consecutively in lft more than once, `sng` is a list containing all the integers that appear only once in lft and are not equal to the integer at the next index in lft and must have at least 1 element, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers that appear consecutively in rgt more than once, `sz` is equal to the minimum of k and twice the number of elements in ldb plus one, and `elem` is the first element in sng. If sz is greater than or equal to k, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken, and the first element of sng which is elem is printed, followed by a space.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n - 1, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers that appear consecutively in lft more than once, `sng` is a list containing all the integers that appear only once in lft and are not equal to the integer at the next index in lft and must have at least 2 elements, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers that appear consecutively in rgt more than once, `sz` is equal to the minimum of k and twice the number of elements in ldb plus two, and `elem` is the second element in sng. If sz is greater than or equal to k, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the second element of sng which is elem is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n - 1, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers that appear consecutively in lft more than once, `sng` is a list containing all the integers that appear only once in lft and are not equal to the integer at the next index in lft and must have at least 3 elements, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers that appear consecutively in rgt more than once, `sz` is equal to the minimum of k and twice the number of elements in ldb plus three, and `elem` is the third element in sng. If sz is greater than or equal to k, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the third element in sng which is elem is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
