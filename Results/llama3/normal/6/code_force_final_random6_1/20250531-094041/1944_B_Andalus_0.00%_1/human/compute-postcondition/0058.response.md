Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is n - 1, ldb is a list containing all the integers that appear consecutively in lft more than once, sng is a list containing all the integers that appear only once in lft and are not equal to the integer at the next index in lft, rdb is a list containing all the integers that appear consecutively in rgt more than once, and sz is equal to the minimum of k and twice the number of elements in ldb.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that all the variables not affected by the loop head and body remain unchanged. The loop iterates over the list ldb, which contains integers that appear consecutively in lft more than once. For each element in ldb, if k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, the element is printed twice with a space in between, and sz is increased by 2. The loop continues until k - sz is less than 2 or all elements in ldb have been processed. The final value of sz is the minimum of k and twice the number of elements in ldb.
