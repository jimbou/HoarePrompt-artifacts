Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is n - 1, ldb is a list containing all the integers that appear consecutively in lft more than once, sng is a list containing all the integers that appear only once in lft and are not equal to the integer at the next index in lft, and rdb is a list containing all the integers that appear consecutively in rgt more than once.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed for all iterations, and the variables have reached their final state. The loop has iterated from 1 to n-1, and the variable i has reached its final value of n-1. The list rdb now contains all the integers that appear consecutively in rgt more than once, as the loop has checked all consecutive pairs of elements in rgt. The other variables remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop head and body.
