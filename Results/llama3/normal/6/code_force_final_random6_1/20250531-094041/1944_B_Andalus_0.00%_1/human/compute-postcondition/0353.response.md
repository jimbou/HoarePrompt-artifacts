Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing at least 3 integers, `ldb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, `elem` is the third element in the list `rdb`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `i`, `rdb`, `ldb`, `sng`, and `elem` remain unchanged. The only effect of the `break` statement is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement that we were directly inside. The rest of the program state remains the same.
