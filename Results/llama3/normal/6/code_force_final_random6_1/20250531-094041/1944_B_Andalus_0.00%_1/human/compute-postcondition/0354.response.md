Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing at least 3 integers, `ldb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, `elem` is the third element in the list `rdb`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
