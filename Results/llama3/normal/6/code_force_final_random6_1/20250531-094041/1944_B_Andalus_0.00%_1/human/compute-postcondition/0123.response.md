The code prints the third element in the list `sng`, which contains all the integers that appear only once in `lft` and are not equal to the integer at the next index in `lft` and must have at least the minimum of `k` and twice the number of elements in `ldb` elements and must have at least 3 elements.
Output: **the third element in the list sng (which is the third integer that appears only once in lft and is not equal to the integer at the next index in lft and must have at least the minimum of k and twice the number of elements in ldb elements and must have at least 3 elements)**
