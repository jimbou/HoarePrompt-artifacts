The code `rdb.append(rgt[i])` appends the value of `rgt[i]` to the list `rdb`. 

Before this operation, `rdb` contains one integer which is equal to the current value of `rgt[i]` which is also equal to the current value of `rgt[i - 1]`. After this operation, `rdb` will contain two integers: the original integer (which is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`) and the new integer (which is equal to `rgt[i]`). 

The values of the other variables are not affected. `i` is still increased by 1, and `n` is still greater than the new value of `i`. `rgt[i]` is still not equal to `rgt[i - 1]`.

Output State: **`rdb` contains two integers: `rgt[i - 1]` and `rgt[i]`, `i` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than the new value of `i`, `rgt[i]` is not equal to `rgt[i - 1]`.**
