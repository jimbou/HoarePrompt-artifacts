Output State: `_` is `T`, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, `sz` is equal to `k`, `i` is `n - 1`, `elem` is `None`, and `stdin` contains no test cases.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated over all test cases in the input, processing each test case and printing the required output. The loop has finished executing, and all variables have reached their final state. The lists `ldb`, `rdb`, and `sng` are empty, indicating that all elements have been processed. The size `sz` has reached the value `k`, and the index `i` has reached the end of the lists `lft` and `rgt`. The variable `elem` is `None`, indicating that there are no more elements to process. Finally, the input `stdin` is empty, indicating that all test cases have been processed.
