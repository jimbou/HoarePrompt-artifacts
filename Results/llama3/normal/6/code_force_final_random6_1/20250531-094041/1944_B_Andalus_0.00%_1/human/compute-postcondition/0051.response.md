To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for elem in ldb:`, so we can only adjust the states of `elem` and `ldb`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `ldb`. If `ldb` has at least two elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ldb` has at least two elements, and `elem` is the next element in `ldb`.

To adjust the states, we need to consider the following:

* `ldb` must have at least two elements, so its length is at least 2.
* `elem` is the next element in `ldb`, so it is the second element in the list.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n - 1, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers that appear consecutively in `lft` more than once and has at least two elements, `sng` is a list containing all the integers that appear only once in `lft` and are not equal to the integer at the next index in `lft`, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers that appear consecutively in `rgt` more than once, `elem` is the second element in `ldb`.**

Note that we did not adjust the state of `sz` because it is not an object in the loop head.
