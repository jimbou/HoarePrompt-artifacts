Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers that are equal to the consecutive duplicate elements in `rgt`, `ldb` is an empty list, `sz` is 0, `sng` is an empty list, `elem` is the last element in the list, and nothing is printed**

In this output state, the value of `sz` has been updated to 0, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The list `rdb` still contains all the integers that are equal to the consecutive duplicate elements in `rgt`, and `ldb` is still an empty list. The variable `i` is still equal to `n - 1`, and `elem` is still the last element in the list. Additionally, `sng` is still an empty list, and nothing has been printed.
