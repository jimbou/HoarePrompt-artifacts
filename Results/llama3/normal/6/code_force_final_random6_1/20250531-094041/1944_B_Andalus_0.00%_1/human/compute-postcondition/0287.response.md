Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers that are equal to the consecutive duplicate elements in `rgt`, `sz` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `sz` has been updated to 0, while the values of `i` and `rdb` remain unchanged. The relationship between `i` and `n` is still maintained, and `rdb` still contains the consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt`.
