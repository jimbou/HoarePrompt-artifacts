The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive and greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 4 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive and greater than 3, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 3, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers that appear consecutively in `lft` more than once, `sng` is a list containing all the integers that appear only once in `lft` and are not equal to the integer at the next index in `lft`, and `rdb` is a list containing the current value of `rgt[i]` if the current value of `rgt[i]` is equal to the current value of `rgt[i - 1]`, otherwise `rdb` is a list containing the current value of `rgt[i]` appended to its previous value.**
