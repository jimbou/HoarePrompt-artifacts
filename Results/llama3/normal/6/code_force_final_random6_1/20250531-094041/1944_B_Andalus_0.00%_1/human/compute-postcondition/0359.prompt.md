Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers that are equal to the consecutive duplicate elements in `rgt`, `ldb` is an empty list, `sz` is 0, `sng` is an empty list, `elem` is the last element in the list, and nothing is printed
Code of the loop:
for elem in rdb:
    if sz >= k:
        break
    if k - sz >= 2:
        print(elem, elem, end=' ')
        sz += 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing at least 1 integer, `ldb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, `elem` is the first element in the list `rdb`. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, `sz` is increased by 2 and the first element of the list `rdb` which is `elem` is printed twice, separated by a space, without a newline character at the end. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing at least 2 integers, `ldb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, `elem` is the second element in the list `rdb`. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, `sz` is increased by 2, the second element of the list `rdb` which is `elem` is printed twice, separated by a space, without starting a new line. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing at least 3 integers, `ldb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, `elem` is the third element in the list `rdb`. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, `sz` is increased by 2. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
