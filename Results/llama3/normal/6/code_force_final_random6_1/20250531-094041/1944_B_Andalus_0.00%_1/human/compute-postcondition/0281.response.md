Output State: **`_` is 2, `T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 2, `ldb` is a list of integers that are equal to the consecutive duplicate elements in `lft`, `sng` is a list of integers that are equal to the single elements in `lft`, `rdb` is a list containing one integer which is equal to the current value of `rgt[i]` which is also equal to the current value of `rgt[i - 1]`, `elem` is not defined, and `sz` is not defined.**

In this output state, the value of `rdb` has been updated to include the current value of `rgt[i]`, which is also equal to the current value of `rgt[i - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
