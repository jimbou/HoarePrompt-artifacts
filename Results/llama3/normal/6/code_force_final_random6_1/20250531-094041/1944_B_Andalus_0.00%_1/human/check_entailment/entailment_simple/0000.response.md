Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input and initializes the necessary variables.
2. It correctly splits the input list into two halves, `lft` and `rgt`, and sorts them.
3. It correctly identifies the duplicate elements in `lft` and stores them in `ldb`. It also identifies the single elements in `lft` and stores them in `sng`.
4. It correctly identifies the duplicate elements in `rgt` and stores them in `rdb`.
5. It correctly prints the required output by iterating over `ldb` and `sng` for the left array, and `rdb` and `sng` for the right array. It ensures that the size of the output arrays does not exceed `k`.
6. The program correctly handles the case where `k` is odd by printing a single element from `sng` to make the size of the output arrays even.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the required functionality. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
