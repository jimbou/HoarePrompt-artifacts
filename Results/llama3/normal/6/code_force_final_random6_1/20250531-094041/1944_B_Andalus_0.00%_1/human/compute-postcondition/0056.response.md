Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n - 1, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers that appear consecutively in `lft` more than once and has at least two elements, `sng` is a list containing all the integers that appear only once in `lft` and are not equal to the integer at the next index in `lft`, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers that appear consecutively in `rgt` more than once, the second element in `ldb` is printed twice with a space in between, and `sz` is increased by 2.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `sz` has been increased by 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
