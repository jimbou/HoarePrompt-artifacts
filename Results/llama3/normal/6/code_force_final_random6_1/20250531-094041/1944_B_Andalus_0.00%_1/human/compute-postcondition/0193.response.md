To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for elem in sng:`. The only object in the loop head that can be adjusted is `elem` and `sng`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `sng`. If the list `sng` has at least two elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `sng` has at least one element, and `elem` is the first element in the list `sng`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `sng` must have at least two elements, and `elem` must be the second element in the list `sng`.

State: **T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is n - 1, ldb is a list containing all elements from lft that appear consecutively more than once, sng is a list containing at least two elements from lft that appear only once, rdb is a list containing all elements from rgt that appear consecutively more than once, sz is the minimum of k and twice the length of ldb plus one, and elem is the second element in the list sng**
