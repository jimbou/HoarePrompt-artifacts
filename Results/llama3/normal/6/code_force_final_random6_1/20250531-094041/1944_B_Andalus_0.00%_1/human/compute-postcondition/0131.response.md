Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is 1, ldb is a list containing one element which is equal to the current value of lft[i - 1], sng is an empty list, rdb is an empty list, sz is not defined, and elem is not defined.**

In natural language, the output state is: All variables remain the same as in the initial state, except for ldb, which now contains one element equal to the current value of lft[i - 1].
