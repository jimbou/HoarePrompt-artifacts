Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is n - 1, `ldb` is a list containing all elements from `lft` that appear consecutively more than once and must have at least 3 elements, `sng` is a list containing all elements from `lft` that appear only once, `rdb` is a list containing all elements from `rgt` that appear consecutively more than once, `elem` is the third element in the list `ldb`, and `sz` is increased by 2.**

In this output state, the value of `sz` has been increased by 2, but its initial value is unknown. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The program has not broken out of the most internal loop or if statement because the condition `sz` is greater than or equal to `k` is not guaranteed to be true.
