Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers that are equal to the consecutive duplicate elements in `rgt`, `ldb` is an empty list, `sz` is `k`**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` remains unchanged at `n - 1`, the list `rdb` still contains all the integers that are equal to the consecutive duplicate elements in `rgt`, the list `ldb` is now empty because all its elements have been processed by the loop, and the value of `sz` has reached `k`, indicating that the loop has executed enough times to satisfy the condition `sz >= k`.
