Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers that are equal to the consecutive duplicate elements in `rgt`, `ldb` is an empty list, `sz` is `k + 1`, `sng` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `elem` is the second element in the list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, but the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.
