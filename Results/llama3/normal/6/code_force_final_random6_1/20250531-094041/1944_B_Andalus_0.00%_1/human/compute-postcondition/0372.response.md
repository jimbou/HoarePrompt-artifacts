Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is an empty list, `ldb` is an empty list, `sz` is `k + 2` if `k` is even and `k + 1` if `k` is odd, `sng` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `elem` is the second element in the list `sng`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made, and the second element of the list `sng` which is `elem` is printed.**

In this output state, the value of `sz` has been incremented by 1. If `k` is even, `sz` is now `k + 2`, and if `k` is odd, `sz` is now `k + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. The program will break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise, it will print the second element of the list `sng`, which is `elem`.
