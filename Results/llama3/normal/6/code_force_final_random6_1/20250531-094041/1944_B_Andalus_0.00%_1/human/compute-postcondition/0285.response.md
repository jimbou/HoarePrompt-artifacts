Postcondition: ***`rgt[i]` is not equal to `rgt[i - 1]` or `rdb` contains one integer which is equal to the current value of `rgt[i]` which is also equal to the current value of `rgt[i - 1]`, `i` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than the new value of `i`. If `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, then `rdb` contains two integers: `rgt[i - 1]` and `rgt[i]`.***
