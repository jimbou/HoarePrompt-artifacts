Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 3, `ldb` is a list containing one integer which is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing the element at index `i` in `lft` and the element at index `i` in `lft`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `T`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `stdin`, `i`, `ldb`, `rdb` remains the same as in the initial state. The list `sng` now contains two elements: the element at index `i` in `lft` (which is the same as the element at index `i` in `lft`) and the element at index `i` in `lft`.
