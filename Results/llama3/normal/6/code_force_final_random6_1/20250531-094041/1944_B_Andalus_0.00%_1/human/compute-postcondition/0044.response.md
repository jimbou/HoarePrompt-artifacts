To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head and how it affects the state of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for elem in ldb:`, which means we are iterating over the elements of the list `ldb`. For the loop to execute again, we need to consider the state of `ldb` and `elem`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers that appear consecutively in `lft` more than once and is not empty. This means that `ldb` has at least one element.

For the loop to execute again, we need to consider the next element in `ldb`. Since `ldb` is not empty, we can assume that there is at least one more element in the list.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n - 1, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers that appear consecutively in `lft` more than once and has at least two elements, `sng` is a list containing all the integers that appear only once in `lft` and are not equal to the integer at the next index in `lft`, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers that appear consecutively in `rgt` more than once, `elem` is the next element in `ldb`**
