Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n - 1, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers that appear consecutively in `lft` more than once, `sng` is a list containing all the integers that appear only once in `lft` and are not equal to the integer at the next index in `lft` and must have at least the minimum of `k` and twice the number of elements in `ldb` elements, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers that appear consecutively in `rgt` more than once and must have at least 2 elements, `sz` is greater than or equal to `k` + 2, and `elem` is the second element in `rdb`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken. The second element of `rdb` which is `elem` is printed twice, separated by a space.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `sz` is increased by 2, and all other variables remain unchanged. The conditions and constraints on the variables are still valid, and the program state is updated accordingly.
