Output State: **i is n - 1, rdb is a list containing all the integers that are equal to the consecutive duplicate elements in rgt.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: the loop counter `i` has reached its final value of `n - 1`, and the list `rdb` contains all the integers that are equal to the consecutive duplicate elements in the sorted list `rgt`.
