The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value and `n` is greater than `i`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`rgt[i]` is not equal to `rgt[i - 1]` or `rdb` contains one integer which is equal to the current value of `rgt[i]` which is also equal to the current value of `rgt[i - 1]`, `i` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than the new value of `i`**
