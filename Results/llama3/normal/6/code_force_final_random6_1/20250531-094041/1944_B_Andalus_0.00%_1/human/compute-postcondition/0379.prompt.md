Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is an empty list, `ldb` is an empty list, `sz` is `k` if `k` is even and `k - 1` if `k` is odd, `sng` is an empty list, `elem` is the last element in the list `rdb`. If `k` is even, all elements in `rdb` are printed twice, separated by a space, without a newline character at the end. If `k` is odd, all elements in `rdb` except the last one are printed twice, separated by a space, without a newline character at the end.
Code of the loop:
for elem in sng:
    if sz >= k:
        break
    print(elem, end=' ')
    sz += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is an empty list, `ldb` is an empty list, `sz` is `k + 1` if `k` is even and `k` if `k` is odd, `sng` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `elem` is the first element in the list `sng`. If the current value of `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made. The first element of the list `sng` which is `elem` has been printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is an empty list, `ldb` is an empty list, `sz` is `k + 2` if `k` is even and `k + 1` if `k` is odd, `sng` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `elem` is the second element in the list `sng`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made, and the second element of the list `sng` which is `elem` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is an empty list, `ldb` is an empty list, `sz` is `k + 3` if `k` is even and `k + 2` if `k` is odd, `sng` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `elem` is the third element in the list `sng`, and the third element of the list `sng` which is `elem` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
