The only object in the loop head is variable  elem and list ldb, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the ldb.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, ldb has at least 1 element, elem is the first element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the elem is the second element in the list.
State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers that are equal to the consecutive duplicate elements in `rgt`, `ldb` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `elem` is the second element in the list.**
