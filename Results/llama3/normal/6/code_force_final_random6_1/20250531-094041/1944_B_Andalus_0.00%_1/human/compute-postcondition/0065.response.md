Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n - 1, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers that appear consecutively in lft more than once, `sng` is a list containing all the integers that appear only once in lft and are not equal to the integer at the next index in lft and must have at least 1 element, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers that appear consecutively in rgt more than once, `sz` is equal to the minimum of k and twice the number of elements in ldb plus one, and `elem` is the first element in sng. If sz is greater than or equal to k, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken, and the first element of sng which is elem is printed, followed by a space.**

In this output state, the value of `sz` has been incremented by 1, and its new value is the minimum of `k` and twice the number of elements in `ldb` plus one. All other variables remain unchanged. The program still breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, and otherwise, it prints the first element of `sng` followed by a space.
