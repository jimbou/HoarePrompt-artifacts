Output: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers that are equal to the consecutive duplicate elements in `rgt`, `ldb` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `elem` is the first element in the list. The current value of `k - sz` is at least 2. If `sz` is at least `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken., and this is printed: elem elem (where elem is the first element in the list ldb)**
