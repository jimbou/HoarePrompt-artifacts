To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive.

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, but we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 2, `ldb` is a list containing all elements from `lft` that appear consecutively more than once, `sng` is a list containing all elements from `lft` that appear only once, and `rdb` is either an empty list or a list containing the current value of `rgt[i]` if it is equal to the current value of `rgt[i - 1]`.**
