Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is `n - 1`. `ldb` is a list containing all the integers that appear consecutively in `lft` more than once, `rdb` is an empty list, and `sng` is a list containing all the integers that appear only once in `lft` and are not equal to the integer at the next index in `lft`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, `ldb` will contain all the integers that appear consecutively more than once in `lft`, `sng` will contain all the integers that appear only once in `lft` and are not equal to the integer at the next index in `lft`, and `rdb` will remain an empty list. The values of `T`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, and `stdin` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop. The loop variable `i` will be `n - 1` after the loop finishes executing.
