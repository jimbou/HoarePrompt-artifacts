To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the state of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive.

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`_` is 2, T is a positive integer greater than 2, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 2.**

Note that the other variables (`ldb`, `sng`, `rdb`, `elem`, and `sz`) are not modified by the loop head, so their states remain the same.
