Output State: **`T` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4, 1 <= k <= floor(n/2)). The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} (1 <= a_i <= n). Every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 * 10^4.**

In natural language, the output state is that `T` has been assigned the value of the first input from stdin, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. The remaining input in stdin still contains multiple test cases, each with two lines as described in the initial state. The values of `n`, `k`, and `a_i` are not affected by this code snippet.
