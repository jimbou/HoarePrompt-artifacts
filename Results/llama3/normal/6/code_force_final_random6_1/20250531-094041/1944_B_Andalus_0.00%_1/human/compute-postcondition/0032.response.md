Output State: `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is `n - 1`, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers that appear consecutively in `lft` more than once, `sng` is a list containing all the integers that appear only once in `lft` and are not equal to the integer at the next index in `lft`, and `rdb` is a list containing all the integers that appear consecutively in `rgt` more than once.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that `T` remains a positive integer greater than 0, `_` remains 0, `n` remains an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` remains an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` remains a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` remains a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` remains a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is now `n - 1`, `ldb` remains a list containing all the integers that appear consecutively in `lft` more than once, `sng` remains a list containing all the integers that appear only once in `lft` and are not equal to the integer at the next index in `lft`, and `rdb` is now a list containing all the integers that appear consecutively in `rgt` more than once.
