Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing at least 2 integers, `ldb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, `elem` is the second element in the list `rdb`. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, `sz` is increased by 2, the second element of the list `rdb` which is `elem` is printed twice, separated by a space, without starting a new line. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
