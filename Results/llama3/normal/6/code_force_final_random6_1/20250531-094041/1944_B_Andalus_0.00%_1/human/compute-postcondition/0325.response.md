The only object in the loop head is variable  elem and list  sng, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list sng.  If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, sng has at least 2 elements, elem is the second element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the elem is the third element in the list.
State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers that are equal to the consecutive duplicate elements in `rgt`, `ldb` is an empty list, `sz` is `k + 2`, `sng` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `elem` is the third element in the list**
