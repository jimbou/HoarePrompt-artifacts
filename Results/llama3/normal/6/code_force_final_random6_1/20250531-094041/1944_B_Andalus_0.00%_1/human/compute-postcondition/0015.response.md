Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 2. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` is a list containing one integer which is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, `rdb` is an empty list, and `sng` is an empty list. If `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then if `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, and `sng` is a list containing the element at index `i` in `lft`. Otherwise, `ldb` is a list containing one integer which is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, `rdb` is an empty list, and `sng` is an empty list.***
