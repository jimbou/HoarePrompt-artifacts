Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is an empty list, `ldb` is an empty list, `sz` is `k` if `k` is even and `k - 1` if `k` is odd, `sng` is an empty list, `elem` is the last element in the list `rdb`. If `k` is even, all elements in `rdb` are printed twice, separated by a space, without a newline character at the end. If `k` is odd, all elements in `rdb` except the last one are printed twice, separated by a space, without a newline character at the end.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop will continue to iterate over the elements in `rdb` until `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`. In each iteration, if `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, the current element `elem` is printed twice, separated by a space, without a newline character at the end, and `sz` is increased by 2. If `k - sz` is less than 2, the loop will break out of the most internal loop or if statement. After the loop finishes executing all the iterations, `rdb` will be an empty list, `ldb` will still be an empty list, `sz` will be equal to `k` if `k` is even and `k - 1` if `k` is odd, `sng` will still be an empty list, and `elem` will be the last element in the list `rdb`. If `k` is even, all elements in `rdb` will be printed twice, separated by a space, without a newline character at the end. If `k` is odd, all elements in `rdb` except the last one will be printed twice, separated by a space, without a newline character at the end.
