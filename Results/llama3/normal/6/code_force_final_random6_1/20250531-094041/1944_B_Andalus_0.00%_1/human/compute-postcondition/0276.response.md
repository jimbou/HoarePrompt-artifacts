The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, i is n - 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1.
State: **_ is 2, T is a positive integer greater than 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive and n is greater than 1, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 1, ldb is a list of integers that are equal to the consecutive duplicate elements in lft, sng is a list of integers that are equal to the single elements in lft, rdb is an empty list, elem is not defined, and sz is not defined**
