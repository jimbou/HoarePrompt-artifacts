Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is n - 1, ldb is a list containing all elements from lft that appear consecutively more than once, sng is a list containing all elements from lft that appear only once, rdb is an empty list, sz is not defined, and elem is not defined.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if rgt[i] == rgt[i - 1]:
        rdb.append(rgt[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 1, `ldb` is a list containing all elements from `lft` that appear consecutively more than once, `sng` is a list containing all elements from `lft` that appear only once, and `rdb` is either an empty list or a list containing the current value of `rgt[i]` if it is equal to the current value of `rgt[i - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 2, `ldb` is a list containing all elements from `lft` that appear consecutively more than once, `sng` is a list containing all elements from `lft` that appear only once, and `rdb` is either an empty list or a list containing the current value of `rgt[i]` if it is equal to the current value of `rgt[i - 1]`. If `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, then `rdb` is a list containing the current value of `rgt[i]` and possibly the current value of `rgt[i - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 3 and less than or equal to 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 3, `ldb` is a list containing all elements from `lft` that appear consecutively more than once, `sng` is a list containing all elements from `lft` that appear only once, and `rdb` is either an empty list or a list containing the current value of `rgt[i]` and possibly the current value of `rgt[i - 1]`. If `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, then `rdb` is a list containing the current value of `rgt[i]` and possibly the current value of `rgt[i - 1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
