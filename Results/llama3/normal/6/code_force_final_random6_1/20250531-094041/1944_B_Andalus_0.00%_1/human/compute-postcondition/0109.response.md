Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is n - 1, ldb is a list containing all the integers that appear consecutively in lft more than once, sng is a list containing all the integers that appear only once in lft and are not equal to the integer at the next index in lft and must have at least the minimum of k and twice the number of elements in ldb elements and must have at least 1 element, rdb is a list containing all the integers that appear consecutively in rgt more than once, sz is greater than or equal to k, and elem is the first element in the list sng. The current value of sz is greater than or equal to k. If k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, then sz is greater than or equal to k + 2, and the last element of rdb which is elem is printed twice, separated by a space. Otherwise, no action is taken, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables remain unchanged, and the conditions and constraints on the variables are still valid.
