Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is an empty list, `ldb` is an empty list, `sz` is `k + 1` if `k` is even and `k` if `k` is odd, `sng` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `elem` is the first element in the list `sng`. If the current value of `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made. The first element of the list `sng` which is `elem` has been printed.**

In this output state, the value of `sz` has been incremented by 1. If `k` is even, `sz` is now `k + 1`, and if `k` is odd, `sz` is now `k`. The other variables remain unchanged. The first element of the list `sng`, which is `elem`, has been printed. Additionally, if the current value of `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
