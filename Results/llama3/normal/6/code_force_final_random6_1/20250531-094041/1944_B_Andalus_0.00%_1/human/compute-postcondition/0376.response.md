The code prints the third element of the list `sng`, which is `elem`. Since the exact value of `elem` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `elem`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the third element of the list `sng`.

Output: **the third element of the list sng**
