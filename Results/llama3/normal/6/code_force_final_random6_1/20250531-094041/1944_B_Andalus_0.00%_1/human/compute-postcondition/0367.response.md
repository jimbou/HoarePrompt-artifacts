The only variable in the loop head is variable  elem, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `sng`. If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `sng` has at least 1 element, `elem` is the first element in the list `sng`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the `elem` is the second element in the list.
State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is an empty list, `ldb` is an empty list, `sz` is `k + 1` if `k` is even and `k` if `k` is odd, `sng` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `elem` is the second element in the list `sng`.**
