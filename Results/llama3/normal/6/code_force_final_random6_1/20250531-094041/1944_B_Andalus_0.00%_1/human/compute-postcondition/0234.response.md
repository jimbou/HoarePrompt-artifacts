Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is n - 1, ldb is a list containing all elements from lft that appear consecutively more than once, sng is a list containing all elements from lft that appear only once, rdb is a list containing all elements from rgt that appear consecutively more than once, elem is the last element in the list rdb, and sz is equal to the minimum of k and twice the length of rdb.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop iterates over all elements in the list rdb. If k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, sz is increased by 2 in each iteration. The loop stops when sz is greater than or equal to k or when all elements in rdb have been processed. The final value of sz is the minimum of k and twice the length of rdb.
