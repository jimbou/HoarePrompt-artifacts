Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is n - 1, ldb is a list containing all elements from lft that appear consecutively more than once, sng is a list containing all elements from lft that appear only once, rdb is a list containing all elements from rgt that appear consecutively more than once, elem is the last element in the list sng, and sz is equal to the minimum of k and twice the length of rdb.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that all variables not affected by the loop head and body remain unchanged. The loop iterates over the list `sng` containing all elements from `lft` that appear only once, and for each element, it prints the element and increments `sz` until `sz` is greater than or equal to `k` or until all elements in `sng` have been processed. The final state of `elem` is the last element in the list `sng`, and `sz` is the minimum of `k` and twice the length of `rdb`.
