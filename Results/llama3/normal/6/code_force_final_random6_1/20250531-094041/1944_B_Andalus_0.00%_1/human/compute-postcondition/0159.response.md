Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is n - 1, ldb is a list containing all elements from lft that appear consecutively more than once, sng is a list containing all elements from lft that appear only once, and rdb is a list containing all elements from rgt that appear consecutively more than once.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop variable `i` has reached its final value of `n - 1`, and the list `rdb` now contains all elements from `rgt` that appear consecutively more than once. The other variables remain unchanged.
