Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 2, `ldb` is a list containing all elements from `lft` that appear consecutively more than once, `sng` is a list containing all elements from `lft` that appear only once, and `rdb` is a list containing the current value of `rgt[i]` and possibly the current value of `rgt[i - 1]` if it is equal to the current value of `rgt[i]`.**

In this output state, the value of `rdb` has been updated to include the current value of `rgt[i]`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. Note that `rdb` may contain the current value of `rgt[i - 1]` if it is equal to the current value of `rgt[i]`, but this is not guaranteed.
