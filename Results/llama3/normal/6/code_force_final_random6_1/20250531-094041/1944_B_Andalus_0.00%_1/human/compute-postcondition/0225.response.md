Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is n - 1, ldb is a list containing all elements from lft that appear consecutively more than once, sng is a list containing all elements from lft that appear only once, rdb is a list containing all elements from rgt that appear consecutively more than once and must have at least 2 elements, elem is the second element in the list rdb, sz is increased by 2.**

In this output state, all variables retain their initial values except for sz, which has been incremented by 2. The value of sz is now sz + 2. The rest of the variables remain unchanged, including T, _, n, k, lst, lft, rgt, stdin, i, ldb, sng, rdb, and elem.
