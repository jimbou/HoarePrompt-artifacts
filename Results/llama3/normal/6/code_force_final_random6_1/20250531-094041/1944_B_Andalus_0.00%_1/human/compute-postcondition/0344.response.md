Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing at least 1 integer, `ldb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, `elem` is the first element in the list `rdb`. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, `sz` is increased by 2 and the first element of the list `rdb` which is `elem` is printed twice, separated by a space, without a newline character at the end. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
