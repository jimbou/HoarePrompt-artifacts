Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n - 1, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers that appear consecutively in `lft` more than once, `sng` is a list containing all the integers that appear only once in `lft` and are not equal to the integer at the next index in `lft` and must have at least the minimum of `k` and twice the number of elements in `ldb` elements, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers that appear consecutively in `rgt` more than once and must have at least one element, `sz` is greater than or equal to `k` + 2, and `elem` is the first element in `rdb`, and nothing is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`. The current value of `k - sz` is less than or equal to 0, and the first element of `rdb` which is `elem` is printed twice with a space in between**

In natural language, the output state is: All variables retain their initial values except for `sz`, which is incremented by 2. The value of `sz` is now greater than or equal to `k` + 2. The first element of `rdb`, `elem`, is printed twice with a space in between. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`.
