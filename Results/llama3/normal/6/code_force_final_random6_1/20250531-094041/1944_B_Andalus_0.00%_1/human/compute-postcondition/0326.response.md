Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers that are equal to the consecutive duplicate elements in `rgt`, `ldb` is an empty list, `sz` is `k + 2`, `sng` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `elem` is the third element in the list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code `break` does not change the values of any variables, but it causes the program to exit the innermost loop or if statement it is directly inside. Therefore, the values of all variables remain the same, but the program's control flow is altered.
