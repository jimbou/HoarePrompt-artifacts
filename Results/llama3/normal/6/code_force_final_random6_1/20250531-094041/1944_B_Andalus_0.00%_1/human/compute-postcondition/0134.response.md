Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 1, `ldb` is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing the element at index `i` in the list `lft`, `rdb` is an empty list, `sz` is not defined, and `elem` is not defined. Additionally, the element at index `i` in the list `lft` is not equal to the element at index `i-1` in the list `lft`. The current value of `i` is less than `n-1` and the element at index `i` in the list `lft` is not equal to the element at index `i+1` in the list `lft`.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables maintain their initial values except for `sng`, which now contains the element at index `i` in the sorted list `lft`. The conditions regarding the relationships between elements in `lft` and the value of `i` remain unchanged.
