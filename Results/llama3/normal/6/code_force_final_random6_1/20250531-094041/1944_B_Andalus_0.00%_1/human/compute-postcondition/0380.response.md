Output State: `i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is an empty list, `ldb` is an empty list, `sz` is `k + len(sng) - 1` if `k` is even and `k + len(sng) - 2` if `k` is odd, `sng` is a list that must have at least `len(sng)` elements, `elem` is the last element in the list `sng`. If `k` is even, all elements in `rdb` are printed twice, separated by a space, without a newline character at the end. If `k` is odd, all elements in `rdb` except the last one are printed twice, separated by a space, without a newline character at the end.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated over all elements in the list `sng`, printing each element and incrementing the size `sz` until it reaches or exceeds the value `k`. The final state of the variables is determined by the number of elements in `sng` and the parity of `k`.
