Output State: `_` is `T`, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, `sz` is equal to `k`, `i` is `n - 1`, and `elem` is the last element in the list `sng`. If `k` is even, all elements in `rdb` are printed twice, separated by a space, without a newline character at the end. If `k` is odd, all elements in `rdb` except the last one are printed twice, separated by a space, without a newline character at the end.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated over all elements in the list `sng`, printing each element and incrementing the size `sz` until it reaches or exceeds the value `k`. The final state of the variables is determined by the number of elements in `sng` and the parity of `k`.
