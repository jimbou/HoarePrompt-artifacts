Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is n - 1, ldb is a list containing all elements from lft that appear consecutively more than once, sng is a list containing all elements from lft that appear only once, rdb is a list containing all elements from rgt that appear consecutively more than once and must have at least 1 element, elem is the first element in the list rdb, sz is increased by 2, and the current value of k minus sz is greater than or equal to 0.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of sz has been increased by 2. The value of k minus sz is now greater than or equal to 0, indicating that sz has increased by 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
