Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is 2, ldb is a list containing one element which is equal to the current value of lft[i - 1] if lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], otherwise ldb is an empty list, sng is a list containing the element at index i in the list lft and the element at index i in the list lft is not equal to the element at index i+1 in the list lft, rdb is an empty list, sz is not defined, and elem is not defined.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `sng` now contains an additional element, which is the element at index `i` in the list `lft`. This is because the code `sng.append(lft[i])` adds the element at index `i` in `lft` to the list `sng`. The other variables remain unchanged.
