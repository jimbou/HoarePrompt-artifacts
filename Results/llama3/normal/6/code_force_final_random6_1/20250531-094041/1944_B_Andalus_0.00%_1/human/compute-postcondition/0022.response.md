According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is `n - 1`, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive and greater than 1, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 1, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers that appear consecutively in `lft` more than once, `rdb` is an empty list, and `sng` is a list containing all the integers that appear only once in `lft` and are not equal to the integer at the next index in `lft`.**
