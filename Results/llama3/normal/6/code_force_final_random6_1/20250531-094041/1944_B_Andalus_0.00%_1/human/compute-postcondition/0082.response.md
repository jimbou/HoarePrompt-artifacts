To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `elem` and `rdb`. The loop will execute if `rdb` has at least one element. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `rdb` to have at least one element, and `elem` will be the first element in `rdb`.

State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n - 1, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers that appear consecutively in lft more than once, `sng` is a list containing all the integers that appear only once in lft and are not equal to the integer at the next index in lft and must have at least the minimum of k and twice the number of elements in ldb elements, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers that appear consecutively in rgt more than once and must have at least one element, `sz` is 0, and `elem` is the first element in rdb, and nothing is printed**
