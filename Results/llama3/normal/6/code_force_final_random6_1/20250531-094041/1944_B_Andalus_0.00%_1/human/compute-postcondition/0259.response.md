Output State: **`_` is 2, `T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 1, `ldb` is a list containing one integer equal to `lft[1]`, `sng` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `elem` is not defined, and `sz` is not defined. The current value of `lft[i]` is equal to the current value of `lft[i - 1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `_` is still 2, `T` is still a positive integer greater than 2, `n` is still an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is still an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is still a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is still a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is still a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is still 1, `ldb` now contains one integer equal to `lft[1]`, `sng` is still an empty list, `rdb` is still an empty list, `elem` is still not defined, and `sz` is still not defined. The current value of `lft[i]` is still equal to the current value of `lft[i - 1]`.
