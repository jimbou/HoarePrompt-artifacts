Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers that are equal to the consecutive duplicate elements in `rgt`, `sz` is at least `k`, `ldb` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `elem` is the first element in the list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `i`, `rdb`, `sz`, `ldb`, and `elem` remain unchanged, as the `break` statement does not affect their values. However, the program execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside, which is the only change in the output state.
