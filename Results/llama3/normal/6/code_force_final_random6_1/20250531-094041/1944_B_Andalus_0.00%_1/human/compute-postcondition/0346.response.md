Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing at least 2 integers, `ldb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, `elem` is the second element in the list `rdb`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `i`, `rdb`, `ldb`, `sng`, and `elem` remain unchanged, as the `break` statement only exits the current loop or if statement without modifying any variables. The only change is that we exit the most internal loop or if statement, which is indicated by the additional phrase "and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement".
