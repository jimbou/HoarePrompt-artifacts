Postcondition: ***`_` is 2, T is a positive integer greater than 2, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 2. If i is less than n - 1 and the third element of the sorted list lft is not equal to the fourth element, then sng is a list with one element which is the third element of the sorted list lft. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
