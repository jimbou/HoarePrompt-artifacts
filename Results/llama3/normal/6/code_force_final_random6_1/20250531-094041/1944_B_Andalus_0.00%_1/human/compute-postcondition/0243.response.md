Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is n - 1, `ldb` is a list containing all elements from `lft` that appear consecutively more than once, `sng` is a list containing at least 2 elements of all elements from `lft` that appear only once, `rdb` is a list containing all elements from `rgt` that appear consecutively more than once, `elem` is the second element in the list `sng`, `sz` is either `k` or more than its previous value and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, but does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, all variables retain their previous values.
