Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers that are equal to the consecutive duplicate elements in `rgt`, `ldb` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `elem` is the first element in the list. If `k - sz` is at least 2, `sz` is increased by 2 and `elem elem` is printed. If `sz` is at least `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
