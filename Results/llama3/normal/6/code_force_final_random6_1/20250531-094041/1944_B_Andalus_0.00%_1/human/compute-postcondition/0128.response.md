Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is n - 1, ldb is an empty list, sng is an empty list, rdb is an empty list, sz is not defined, and elem is not defined.**

The code snippet reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to `n` and `k`, respectively. It then reads a list of 2n integers from stdin and assigns it to `lst`. The first `n` elements of `lst` are assigned to `lft`, and the remaining `n` elements are assigned to `rgt`. Both `lft` and `rgt` are sorted in ascending order. The lists `ldb`, `sng`, and `rdb` are initialized as empty lists. The variables `sz` and `elem` are not defined in this code snippet.
