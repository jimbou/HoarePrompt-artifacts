Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n - 1, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers that appear consecutively in `lft` more than once, `sng` is a list containing all the integers that appear only once in `lft` and are not equal to the integer at the next index in `lft` and must have at least the minimum of `k` and twice the number of elements in `ldb` elements, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers that appear consecutively in `rgt` more than once and must have at least 3 elements, `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `elem` is the third element in `rdb`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code snippet is a simple break statement, which means it will exit the current loop or if statement it is directly inside. The values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, but the program will break out of the most internal loop or if statement it is directly inside.
