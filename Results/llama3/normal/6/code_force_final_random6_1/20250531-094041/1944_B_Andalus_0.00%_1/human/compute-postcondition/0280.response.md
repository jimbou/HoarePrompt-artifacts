To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive and greater than 1.

To execute the loop again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, but we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

Here is the updated state:

State: **`_` is 2, `T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 2, `ldb` is a list of integers that are equal to the consecutive duplicate elements in `lft`, `sng` is a list of integers that are equal to the single elements in `lft`, if `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, then `rdb` is a list containing one integer which is equal to the current value of `rgt[i]` which is also equal to the current value of `rgt[i - 1]`, otherwise `rdb` is an empty list, `elem` is not defined, and `sz` is not defined.**
