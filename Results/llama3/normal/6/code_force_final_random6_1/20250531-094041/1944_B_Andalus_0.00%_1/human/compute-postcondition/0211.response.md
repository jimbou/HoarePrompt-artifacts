According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `rdb`. If `rdb` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the state of `rdb` is a list containing all elements from `rgt` that appear consecutively more than once, but it does not ensure that the loop will execute. So, it needs to be adjusted to `rdb` must have at least 1 element and `elem` is the first element in the list `rdb`.

State: **T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is n - 1, ldb is a list containing all elements from lft that appear consecutively more than once, sng is a list containing all elements from lft that appear only once, rdb is a list containing all elements from rgt that appear consecutively more than once and must have at least 1 element, sz is 0, and elem is the first element in the list rdb**
