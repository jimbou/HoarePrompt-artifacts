Output State: **`_` is 2, T is a positive integer greater than 2, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 2, sng is a list with one element which is the third element of the sorted list lft.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `_` is still 2, T is still a positive integer greater than 2, n is still an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is still an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is still a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is still a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is still a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is still 2, and sng is a list with one element which is the third element of the sorted list lft.
