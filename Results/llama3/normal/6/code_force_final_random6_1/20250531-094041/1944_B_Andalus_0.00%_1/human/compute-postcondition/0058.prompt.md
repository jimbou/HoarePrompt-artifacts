Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is n - 1, ldb is a list containing all the integers that appear consecutively in lft more than once, sng is a list containing all the integers that appear only once in lft and are not equal to the integer at the next index in lft, rdb is a list containing all the integers that appear consecutively in rgt more than once, and sz is 0.
Code of the loop:
for elem in ldb:
    if sz >= k:
        break
    if k - sz >= 2:
        print(elem, elem, end=' ')
        sz += 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n - 1, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers that appear consecutively in `lft` more than once and is not empty, `sng` is a list containing all the integers that appear only once in `lft` and are not equal to the integer at the next index in `lft`, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers that appear consecutively in `rgt` more than once. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, then `sz` is greater than or equal to `k` - 2. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n - 1, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers that appear consecutively in `lft` more than once and has at least two elements, `sng` is a list containing all the integers that appear only once in `lft` and are not equal to the integer at the next index in `lft`, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers that appear consecutively in `rgt` more than once, `elem` is the next element in `ldb`. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, `sz` is increased by 2. Otherwise, no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n - 1, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers that appear consecutively in `lft` more than once and has at least two elements, `sng` is a list containing all the integers that appear only once in `lft` and are not equal to the integer at the next index in `lft`, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers that appear consecutively in `rgt` more than once. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, the second element in `ldb` is printed twice with a space in between, and `sz` is increased by 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
