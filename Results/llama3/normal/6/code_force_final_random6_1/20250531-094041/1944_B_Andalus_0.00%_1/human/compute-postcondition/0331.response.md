Output State: `i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers that are equal to the consecutive duplicate elements in `rgt`, `ldb` is an empty list, `sz` is `k + len(sng)`, `sng` is an empty list, `elem` is the last element in the list.

The loop will execute until `sz` is greater than or equal to `k` or until all elements in `sng` have been processed. After the loop finishes executing, `sz` will be equal to `k` plus the number of elements in `sng`, and `sng` will be an empty list because all its elements have been processed. The value of `elem` will be the last element in the list `sng`. The values of `i`, `rdb`, and `ldb` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the loop.
