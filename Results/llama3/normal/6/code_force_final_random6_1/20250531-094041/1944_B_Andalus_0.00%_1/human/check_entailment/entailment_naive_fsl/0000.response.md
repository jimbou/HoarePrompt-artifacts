Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input array has an odd number of single elements (i.e., elements that appear only once in the array). In this case, the program will not be able to find a pair of arrays `l` and `r` that satisfy the condition that the bitwise XOR of elements of `l` is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of `r`.

For example, consider the input array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]` with `n = 5` and `k = 2`. The program will not be able to find a pair of arrays `l` and `r` that satisfy the condition, because there are an odd number of single elements in the array.

The program only checks for pairs of duplicate elements and single elements, but it does not consider the case where there are an odd number of single elements. This is a potential case that the program does not handle correctly, and therefore the program is incorrect.
