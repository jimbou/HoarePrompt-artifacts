State: **T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is 3. If lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], then ldb is a list containing two elements which are equal to the current value of lft[i - 1]. If lft[i] is not equal to lft[i - 1], then ldb is a list containing one element which is equal to the current value of lft[i - 1]. If i is less than n-1 and lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], then sng is a list containing the element at index i in the list lft. Otherwise, sng is an empty list. rdb is an empty list, sz is not defined, and elem is not defined.**
