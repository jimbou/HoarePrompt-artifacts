The only variable in the loop head is variable `elem` and `ldb`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `ldb`. If `ldb` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers that appear consecutively in `lft` more than once. So for the loop to be executed, `ldb` must not be empty and `elem` is the first element in `ldb`.

State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n - 1, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers that appear consecutively in lft more than once and is not empty, `sng` is a list containing all the integers that appear only once in lft and are not equal to the integer at the next index in lft, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers that appear consecutively in rgt more than once, `sz` is 0, `elem` is the first element in `ldb`**
