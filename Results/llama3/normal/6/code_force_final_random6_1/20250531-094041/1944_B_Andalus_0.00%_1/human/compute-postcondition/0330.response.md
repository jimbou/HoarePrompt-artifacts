Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers that are equal to the consecutive duplicate elements in `rgt`, `ldb` is an empty list, `sz` is `k + 3`, `sng` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `elem` is the third element in the list. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the third element of the list `sng` is printed, which is `elem`.**

In this output state, the value of `sz` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `sz` being `k + 3`. The other variables remain unchanged. The program still breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, and the third element of the list `sng` is printed, which is `elem`.
