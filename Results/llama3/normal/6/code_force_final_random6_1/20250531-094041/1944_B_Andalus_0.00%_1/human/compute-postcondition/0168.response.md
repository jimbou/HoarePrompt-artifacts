Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is n - 1, ldb is a list containing all elements from lft that appear consecutively more than once and must have at least 1 element, sng is a list containing all elements from lft that appear only once, rdb is a list containing all elements from rgt that appear consecutively more than once, elem is the first element in the list ldb, and sz is increased by 2.**

In this output state, all variables retain their initial values except for sz, which has been incremented by 2. The value of k minus sz is now greater than or equal to 0. The first element in the list ldb, which is elem, has been printed twice with a space in between.
