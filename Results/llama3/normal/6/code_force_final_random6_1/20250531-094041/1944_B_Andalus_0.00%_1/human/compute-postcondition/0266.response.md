Output State: **`_` is 2, T is a positive integer greater than 2, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 2, ldb is a list that includes the third element of the sorted list lft.**

In this output state, the value of ldb has been updated to include the third element of the sorted list lft, which is the element at index 2 (since indexing starts at 0). The other variables remain unchanged.
