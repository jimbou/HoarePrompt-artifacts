Based on the precondition, the code will print the first element of the list `rdb` twice, separated by a space.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

* `i` is `n - 1`, but this variable is not used in the print statement, so it doesn't affect the output.
* `rdb` is a list containing at least 1 integer, and `elem` is the first element of this list.
* `ldb` and `sng` are empty lists, but they are not used in the print statement, so they don't affect the output.
* The print statement uses the `end` parameter to specify that the output should be followed by a space instead of a newline.
* The print statement prints the value of `elem` twice, separated by a space.

Therefore, the output will be the first element of the list `rdb` printed twice, separated by a space.

Output: **[first element of rdb] [first element of rdb]**
