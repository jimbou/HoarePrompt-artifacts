Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains 2n integers. The function processes each test case by sorting the integers, identifying pairs and singletons, and printing the first k pairs and singletons. The function iterates over all test cases, processing each one and printing the required output, until all test cases have been processed and the input is empty.**
