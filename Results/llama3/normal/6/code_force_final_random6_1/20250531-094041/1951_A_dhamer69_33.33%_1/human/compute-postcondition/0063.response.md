Output State: **t is 0, n is an integer equal to the first input, s is a binary string of length t equal to the second input, stdin contains no test cases. If n is 2, 'YES' is printed if s is '00', otherwise 'NO' is printed. If n is not 2, 'NO' is printed if the number of '1' in s is odd or if the number of '1' in s is even and s contains exactly one occurrence of '11', otherwise 'YES' is printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `t` will be 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The variables `n` and `s` will retain their values from the last iteration, representing the length of the binary string and the binary string itself, respectively. The standard input (`stdin`) will be empty, as all test cases would have been consumed by the loop. The output will depend on the values of `n` and `s`, following the same logic as before: if `n` is 2, 'YES' will be printed if `s` is '00', otherwise 'NO' will be printed. If `n` is not 2, 'NO' will be printed if the number of '1's in `s` is odd or if `s` contains exactly one occurrence of '11', otherwise 'YES' will be printed.
