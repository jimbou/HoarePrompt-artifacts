The code reads an integer value from stdin and assigns it to `n`, then reads a binary string of the same length as `t` from stdin and assigns it to `s`. The value of `t` is not modified by the code.

Output State: **t is a positive integer less than or equal to 50, n is an integer, s is a binary string of length t, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**
