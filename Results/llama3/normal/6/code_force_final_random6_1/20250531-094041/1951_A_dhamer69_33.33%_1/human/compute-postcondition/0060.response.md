Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer less than or equal to 48 and greater than 0, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `s` is a binary string of length `t` equal to the second input, `count_1` is an integer equal to the number of '1's in `s`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. If the count of '1's in `s` is odd, 'NO' is being printed. If the count of '1's in `s` is even, then if the binary string `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11', 'NO' is being printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is being printed.***
