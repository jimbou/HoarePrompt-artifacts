Reasoning:

1. The problem requires determining whether a given configuration of lamps can be reached by performing the operation of turning on two non-adjacent lamps any number of times.
2. The program first checks if the number of lamps `n` is 2. If it is, the program checks the configuration `s`. If `s` is '00', it prints 'YES' because no lamps need to be turned on. If `s` is not '00', it prints 'NO' because it is impossible to turn on both lamps with the given operation.
3. If `n` is not 2, the program counts the number of '1's in the configuration `s` and checks if it is even. If it is not even, the program prints 'NO' because the operation can only turn on an even number of lamps.
4. If the count of '1's is even, the program checks if there is exactly one pair of adjacent '1's in the configuration `s`. If there is, the program prints 'NO' because it is impossible to turn on these two lamps with the given operation.
5. If there are no adjacent '1's or more than one pair of adjacent '1's, the program prints 'YES' because it is possible to turn on all the lamps with the given operation.

Correctness: **True**
