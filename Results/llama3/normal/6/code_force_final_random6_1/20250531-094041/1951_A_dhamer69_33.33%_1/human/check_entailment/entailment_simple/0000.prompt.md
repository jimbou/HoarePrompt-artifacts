Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
There are 𝑛 lamps numbered 1 to 𝑛 lined up in a row, initially turned off. You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero): Choose two non-adjacent† lamps that are currently turned off, then turn them on. Determine whether you can reach configuration 𝑠, where 𝑠𝑖=1 means the 𝑖-th lamp is turned on, and 𝑠𝑖=0 otherwise. † Only lamp 𝑖 and 𝑖+1 are adjacent for all 1≤𝑖<𝑛. Note that lamp 𝑛 and 1 are not adjacent when 𝑛≠2. Input: Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer 𝑡 (1≤𝑡≤1000) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains an integer 𝑛 (1≤𝑛≤50) — the number of lamps. The second line of each test case contains a binary string 𝑠 of size 𝑛 — the final desired configuration. Output: For each test case, print on one line "YES" if we can reach the configuration 𝑠 via applying the given operation any number of times. Otherwise, print "NO".

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer and then a binary string of the same length as the integer. The integer is a positive integer less than or equal to 50.
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        n = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        if n == 2:
            if s == '00':
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        else:
            count_1 = s.count('1')
            if count_1 % 2 != 0:
                print('NO')
            elif s.count('11') == 1:
                print('NO')
            else:
                print('YES')
        
        t -= 1
        
    #State: t is 0, n is an integer equal to the first input, s is a binary string of length t equal to the second input, stdin contains no test cases. If n is 2, 'YES' is printed if s is '00', otherwise 'NO' is printed. If n is not 2, 'NO' is printed if the number of '1' in s is odd or if the number of '1' in s is even and s contains exactly one occurrence of '11', otherwise 'YES' is printed.
