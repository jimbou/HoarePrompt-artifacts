Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer less than or equal to 50, n is an integer, s is a binary string of length t, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If n is 2, then if s is '00', 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If n is not 2, then if the count of '1's in s is odd, 'NO' is printed. If the count of '1's in s is even, then if s contains exactly one occurrence of '11', 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, if s contains either no occurrences of '11' or more than one occurrence of '11', then 'YES' is printed.***
