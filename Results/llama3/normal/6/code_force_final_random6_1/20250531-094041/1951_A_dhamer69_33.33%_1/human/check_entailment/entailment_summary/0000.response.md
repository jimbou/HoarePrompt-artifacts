Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly handles the base case where n = 2, and for n > 2, it checks if the number of '1's in the string is even and if there are no adjacent '1's. If these conditions are met, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. This is in line with the problem description, which states that we can perform the operation any number of times, and the goal is to determine whether we can reach the desired configuration.

The program also correctly handles the case where the number of '1's is odd, in which case it is impossible to reach the desired configuration.

Correctness: **True**
