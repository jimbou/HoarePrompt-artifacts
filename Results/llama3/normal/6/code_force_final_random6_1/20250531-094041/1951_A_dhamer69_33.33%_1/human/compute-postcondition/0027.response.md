The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t.  If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is a positive integer less than or equal to 49, So for the loop to be executed one more time t must be greater than 0.
State: **t is a positive integer less than or equal to 49 and t must be greater than 0, n is an integer, s is a binary string of length t, stdin contains multiple test cases.**
