Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. For the case where `n` is 2, the program correctly handles the possible configurations. If the desired configuration is '00', it's possible to reach it by not performing any operations. If the desired configuration is '01', '10', or '11', it's not possible to reach it because there are no non-adjacent lamps to turn on.

2. For the case where `n` is not 2, the program checks two conditions:
   - If the number of '1's in the desired configuration is odd, it's not possible to reach it because every operation turns on two lamps.
   - If the number of '1's in the desired configuration is even and there is exactly one occurrence of '11', it's not possible to reach it because there are no non-adjacent lamps to turn on to get the second '1'.

   If neither of these conditions is true, the program correctly prints 'YES' because it's possible to reach the desired configuration by turning on non-adjacent lamps.

Correctness: **True**
