Output State: **`t` is a positive integer less than or equal to 48 and greater than 0, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `s` is a binary string of length `t` equal to the second input, `count_1` is an integer equal to the number of '1's in `s`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains the same, a positive integer less than or equal to 48 and greater than 0. The value of `n` remains the same, an integer equal to the first input. The value of `s` remains the same, a binary string of length `t` equal to the second input. A new variable `count_1` is introduced, which is an integer equal to the number of '1's in the binary string `s`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
