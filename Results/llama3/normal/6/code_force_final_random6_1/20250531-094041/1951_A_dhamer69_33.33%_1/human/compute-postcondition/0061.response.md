Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer less than or equal to 48 and greater than 0, n is an integer equal to the first input, s is a binary string of length t equal to the second input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. If n is 2, then if s is '00', 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If n is not 2, then if the count of '1's in s is odd, 'NO' is printed. If the count of '1's in s is even, then if the binary string s contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11', 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.***
