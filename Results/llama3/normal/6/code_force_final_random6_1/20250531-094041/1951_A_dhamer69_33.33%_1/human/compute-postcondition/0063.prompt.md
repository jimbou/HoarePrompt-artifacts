Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer less than or equal to 50, stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing one input: a binary string of the same length as the integer `t`.
Code of the loop:
while t > 0:
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    if n == 2:
        if s == '00':
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        count_1 = s.count('1')
        if count_1 % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif s.count('11') == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
    t -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer less than or equal to 49, n is an integer, s is a binary string of length t, stdin contains multiple test cases. If n is 2, then if s is '00', 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If n is not 2, then if the count of '1's in s is odd, 'NO' is printed. If the count of '1's in s is even, then if s contains exactly one occurrence of '11', 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, if s contains either no occurrences of '11' or more than one occurrence of '11', then 'YES' is printed.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is a positive integer less than or equal to 48 and greater than 0, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `s` is a binary string of length `t` equal to the second input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. If `n` is 2, 'YES' is printed if `s` is '00', otherwise 'NO' is printed. If `n` is not 2, 'NO' is printed if the number of '1' in `s` is odd or if the number of '1' in `s` is even and `s` contains exactly one occurrence of '11', otherwise 'YES' is printed.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is a positive integer less than or equal to 47 and greater than 0, n is an integer equal to the first input, s is a binary string of length t equal to the second input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. If n is 2, then if s is '00', 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If n is not 2, then if the count of '1's in s is odd, 'NO' is printed. If the count of '1's in s is even, then if the binary string s contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11', 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
