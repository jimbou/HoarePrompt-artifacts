Functionality: **This function processes multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of a positive integer (n) and a binary string (s) of the same length. It checks the validity of the binary string based on the length and the number of '1's. If the length is 2, it prints 'YES' if the string is '00', otherwise 'NO'. If the length is not 2, it prints 'NO' if the number of '1's is odd or if the number of '1's is even and the string contains exactly one '11', otherwise 'YES'. The function continues processing test cases until all inputs have been read.**
