Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer less than or equal to 50, `n` is an integer not equal to 2, `s` is a binary string of length `t`, `count_1` is an integer between 0 and `t` (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and `count_1` is even. If the string `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11', then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, if `s` contains either no occurrences of '11' or more than one occurrence of '11', then 'YES' is printed.***
