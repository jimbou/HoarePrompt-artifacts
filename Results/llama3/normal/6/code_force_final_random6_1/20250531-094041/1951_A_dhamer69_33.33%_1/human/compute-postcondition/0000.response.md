The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the stdin and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case contains two inputs: first an integer and then a binary string of the same length as the integer. The integer is a positive integer less than or equal to 50.

Since the code only reads the first input (the integer) from the stdin, the remaining input (the binary string) is still in the stdin. Also, the value of `t` is now a positive integer less than or equal to 50.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer less than or equal to 50, stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing one input: a binary string of the same length as the integer `t`.**
