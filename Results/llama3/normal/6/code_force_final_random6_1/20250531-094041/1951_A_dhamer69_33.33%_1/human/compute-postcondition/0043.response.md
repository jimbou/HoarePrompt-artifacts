Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer less than or equal to 49 and greater than 0, n is an integer equal to the first input, s is a binary string of length t equal to the second input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. If n is 2, 'YES' is printed if s is '00', otherwise 'NO' is printed. If n is not 2, 'NO' is printed if the number of '1' in s is odd or if the number of '1' in s is even and s contains exactly one occurrence of '11', otherwise 'YES' is printed.***
