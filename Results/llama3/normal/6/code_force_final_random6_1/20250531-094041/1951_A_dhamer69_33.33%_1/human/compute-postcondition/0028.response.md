Output State: **t is a positive integer less than or equal to 49 and t must be greater than 0, n is an integer equal to the first input, s is a binary string of length t equal to the second input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `n` is updated to be equal to the first input from stdin, which is an integer. The value of `s` is updated to be a binary string of length `t`, equal to the second input from stdin. Stdin now contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, as two inputs have been consumed by the code.
