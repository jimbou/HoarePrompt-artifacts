Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when the input string `s` contains two consecutive '1's but they are not the only '1's in the string. For example, if `n = 4` and `s = '1101'`, the program will incorrectly print 'NO' because it only checks if there is exactly one pair of consecutive '1's, but it does not check if there are other '1's in the string that can be turned on separately.

In this case, the correct output should be 'YES' because we can turn on the first and third lamps, and then turn on the second and fourth lamps.
