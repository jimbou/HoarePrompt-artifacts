Output State: **`t` is a positive integer less than or equal to 50, `n` is an integer not equal to 2, `s` is a binary string of length `t`, `count_1` is an integer between 0 and `t` (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of `count_1` is calculated by counting the number of '1's in the binary string `s`, which has a length of `t`. The value of `count_1` can range from 0 (if all characters in `s` are '0') to `t` (if all characters in `s` are '1'). The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
