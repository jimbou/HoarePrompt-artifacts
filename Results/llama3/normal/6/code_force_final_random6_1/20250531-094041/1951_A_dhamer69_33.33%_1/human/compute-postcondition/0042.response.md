Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer less than or equal to 49 and `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `s` is a binary string of length `t` equal to the second input, `count_1` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in `s`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. If `count_1` is odd, 'NO' is printed. If `count_1` is even, 'NO' is printed if `s` contains exactly one occurrence of '11', otherwise 'YES' is printed.***
