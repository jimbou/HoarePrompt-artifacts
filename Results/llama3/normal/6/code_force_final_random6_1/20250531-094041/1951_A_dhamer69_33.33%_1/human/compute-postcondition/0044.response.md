Output State: **`t` is a positive integer less than or equal to 48 and greater than 0, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `s` is a binary string of length `t` equal to the second input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. If `n` is 2, 'YES' is printed if `s` is '00', otherwise 'NO' is printed. If `n` is not 2, 'NO' is printed if the number of '1' in `s` is odd or if the number of '1' in `s` is even and `s` contains exactly one occurrence of '11', otherwise 'YES' is printed.**

The value of `t` is decremented by 1, but the previous value of `t` was a positive integer less than or equal to 49 and greater than 0, so the new value of `t` is a positive integer less than or equal to 48 and greater than 0. The values of the other variables are not affected.
