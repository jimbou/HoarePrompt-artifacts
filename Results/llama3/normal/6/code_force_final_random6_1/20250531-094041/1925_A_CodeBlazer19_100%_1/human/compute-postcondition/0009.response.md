To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `t` is at least 2.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `t` remains the same, but since it must be greater than `i` for the loop to execute again, `t` must be at least 3.

The other variables, `n` and `k`, are not affected by the loop iteration, so their states remain the same. The state of `stdin` and the printed output also remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are the two integers that were inputted, stdin contains no input, and this is printed: a string consisting of the first [k] characters of the alphabet repeated [n] times**
