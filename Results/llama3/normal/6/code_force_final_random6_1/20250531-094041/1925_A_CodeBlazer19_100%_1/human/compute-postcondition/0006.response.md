Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are the two integers that were inputted, stdin contains no input, and this is printed: 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n, which is a string consisting of the first k characters of the alphabet repeated n times**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the code. The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the two integers that were inputted, which are now stored in these variables. The stdin is still empty, as no new input is provided. The printed string remains the same, but now `n` and `k` have specific values, which are the inputted integers.
