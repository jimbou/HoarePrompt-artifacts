Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `n` is the number of times the first `k` characters of the alphabet are repeated, `k` is the number of characters of the alphabet repeated, stdin contains no input, and this is printed: a string consisting of the first `k` characters of the alphabet repeated `n` times**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The variables `n` and `k` are updated to the values inputted by the user, which are used to print a string consisting of the first `k` characters of the alphabet repeated `n` times. The stdin remains empty as no input is expected after the initial input.
