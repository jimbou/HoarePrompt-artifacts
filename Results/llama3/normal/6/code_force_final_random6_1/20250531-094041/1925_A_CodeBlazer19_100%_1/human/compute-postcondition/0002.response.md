Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers, stdin contains no input**.

In this output state, the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the code. The code assigns the values of `n` and `k` to the integers obtained from the input, which is a space-separated list of integers. Since the input is consumed by the `input().split()` function, the stdin is now empty.
