Output State: **`t` is at least `t`, `i` is `t-1`, `n` and `k` are the last two integers that were inputted, stdin contains no input, and this is printed: a string consisting of the first `k` characters of the alphabet repeated `n` times.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` will be at least equal to the initial value of `t`, the loop counter `i` will be one less than the initial value of `t`, the variables `n` and `k` will hold the last two integers that were inputted from stdin, stdin will be empty, and the last output will be a string consisting of the first `k` characters of the alphabet repeated `n` times.
