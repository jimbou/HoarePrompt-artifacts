The code prints a string consisting of the first `k` characters of the alphabet repeated `n` times.
Since `k` is the number of characters of the alphabet repeated and `n` is the number of times the first `k` characters of the alphabet are repeated, the print statement will output a string that repeats the first `k` characters of the alphabet `n` times.
Output: **the first [k] characters of the alphabet repeated [n] times**
