The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `t` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers, stdin contains no input, and this is printed: 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n, which is a string consisting of the first k characters of the alphabet repeated n times**
