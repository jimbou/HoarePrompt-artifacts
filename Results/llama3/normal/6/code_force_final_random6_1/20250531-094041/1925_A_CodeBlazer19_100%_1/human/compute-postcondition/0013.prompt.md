Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, stdin contains one input: a positive integer between 1 and 26 inclusive.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    print('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers, stdin contains no input, and this is printed: 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n, which is a string consisting of the first k characters of the alphabet repeated n times

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are the two integers that were inputted, stdin contains no input, and this is printed: a string consisting of the first [k] characters of the alphabet repeated [n] times

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `n` is the number of times the first `k` characters of the alphabet are repeated, `k` is the number of characters of the alphabet repeated, stdin contains no input, and a string consisting of the first `k` characters of the alphabet repeated `n` times is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
