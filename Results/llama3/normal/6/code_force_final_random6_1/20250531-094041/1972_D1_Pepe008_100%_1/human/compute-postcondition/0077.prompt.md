Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two positive integers n and m, such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases do not exceed 2 * 10^6, but one integer has been removed from the stdin.
Code of the loop:
for t in range(T):
    info = input().split()
    a, b = int(info[0]), int(info[1])
    suma = 0
    for i in range(1, b + 1):
        x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
        if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
            suma += x
            if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
                suma += 1
    print(suma - 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: T is greater than 0, t is 0, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, i is equal to b, x is equal to (a - b * (b - 1)) // b^2 + 1, and suma is increased by the sum of x values for all iterations where (a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1 > 0, and an additional 1 for iterations where (a - i * (i - 1)) % i^2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i^2 == 0, and the value of suma minus 2 is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: T is greater than 1, t is 1, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, i is equal to b, x is equal to (a - b * (b - 1)) // b^2 + 1, suma is increased by the sum of x values for all iterations where (a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1 > 0, and an additional 1 for iterations where (a - i * (i - 1)) % i^2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i^2 == 0, and the value of suma minus 2 is being printed, info is a list of two integers, a is the first integer in info, b is the second integer in info, and suma is 0, and the value of suma minus 2 is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `a` is the first integer in the input, `b` is at least 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `i` is equal to `b`, `x` is equal to `(a - b * (b - 1)) // b^2 + 1`, `suma` is increased by the sum of `x` values for all iterations where `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1 > 0`, and an additional 1 for iterations where `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i^2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i^2 == 0`, `info` is a list of two integers, `a` is the first integer in `info`, `b` is the second integer in `info`, and the value of `suma` minus 2 is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
