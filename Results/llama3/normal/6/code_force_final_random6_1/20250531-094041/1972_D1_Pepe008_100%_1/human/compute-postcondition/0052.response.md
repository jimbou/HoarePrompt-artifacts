Output State: **T is greater than 2, t is 2, a is the first integer in the input, b is the second integer in the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, i is equal to b, x is equal to (a - b * (b - 1)) // b^2 + 1, suma is increased by the sum of x values for all iterations where (a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1 > 0, and an additional 1 for iterations where (a - i * (i - 1)) % i^2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i^2 == 0, and the value of suma minus 2 is being printed, info is a list of two integers, a is the first integer in info, b is the second integer in info, and suma is 0, and the value of suma minus 2 is printed**

The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `a` and `b`, respectively. The value of `suma` is reset to 0. The variables `T`, `t`, `i`, and `x` are not modified by the code. The input is reduced by one test case. The value of `suma` minus 2 is still being printed. The list `info` is updated to contain the two input integers.
