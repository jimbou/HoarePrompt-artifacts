The only variable in the loop head is variable `t` and `T`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t` and `T`. If `t` is less than `T`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is 1, `T` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `t` is increased by 1 so `t` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `T` must be greater than 2.
State: **T is greater than 2, t is 2, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, i is equal to b, x is equal to (a - b * (b - 1)) // b^2 + 1, suma is increased by the sum of x values for all iterations where (a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1 > 0, and an additional 1 for iterations where (a - i * (i - 1)) % i^2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i^2 == 0, and the value of suma minus 2 is being printed, info is a list of two integers, a is the first integer in info, b is the second integer in info, and suma is 0, and the value of suma minus 2 is printed**
