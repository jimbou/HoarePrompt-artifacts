To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `b`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `b` is at least 1, since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `b + 1`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `b` to be at least 1.

The variable `i` is initialized to 1 at the start of the loop, so we can adjust its state to be 1.

The other variables `T`, `t`, `a`, `suma`, and `stdin` are not directly related to the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is at least 1, `suma` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `i` is 1**
