Postcondition: **T is greater than 1, t is 1, a is a positive integer, b is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, i is 1, x is equal to (a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1, suma is increased by the sum of x values for all iterations where (a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1 > 0, and an additional 1 for iterations where (a - i * (i - 1)) % i^2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i^2 == 0, and the value of suma minus 2 is being printed, info is a list of two integers, a is the first integer in info, b is the second integer in info, and suma is 0, x is equal to (a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1^2 + 1 which is (a - 0) // 1 + 1 which is a + 1. The current value of x is greater than 0.**
