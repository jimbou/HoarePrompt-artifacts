Output State: **`T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `a` is the first integer in the input, `b` is at least 3, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `i` is 3, `x` is equal to `(a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3^2 + 1`, `suma` is increased by the value of `(a - 2 * (3 - 1)) // 2^2 + 1` if `(a - 2 * (3 - 1)) // 2^2 + 1 > 0`, otherwise `suma` remains unchanged, `info` is a list of two integers, `a` is the first integer in `info`, `b` is the second integer in `info`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `T` is still greater than 2, `t` remains 2, `a` is still the first integer in the input, `b` is at least 3, there are multiple test cases minus three in `stdin`, `i` is 3, `x` is now calculated using the new formula `(a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3^2 + 1`, `suma` is increased by the previous value of `x` if it was positive, and `info` is still a list of two integers with `a` as the first integer and `b` as the second integer.
