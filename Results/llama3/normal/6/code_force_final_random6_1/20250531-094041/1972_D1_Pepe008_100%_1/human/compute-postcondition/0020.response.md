Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is at least 3, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `i` is 3, `x` is equal to `((a - 3 * 2) // 9 + 1)`, `suma` is increased by `((a - 3 * 2) // 9 + 2)`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `suma` is increased by 1, in addition to the previous increase by `((a - 3 * 2) // 9 + 1)`. The values of the other variables remain the same.
