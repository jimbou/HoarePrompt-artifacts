Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is at least 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `i` is 2, `x` is equal to `((a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2)`, and `suma` is increased by `((a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2)`**

In this output state, the value of `suma` has been updated by adding the value of `x`, which is equal to `((a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2)`. The other variables remain unchanged.
