Output State: *`T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `a` is the first integer in the input, `b` is at least 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `i` is equal to `b`, `x` is equal to `(a - b * (b - 1)) // b^2 + 1`, `suma` is increased by the sum of `x` values for all iterations where `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1 > 0`, and an additional 1 for iterations where `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i^2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i^2 == 0`, and the value of `suma` minus 2 is being printed, `info` is a list of two integers, `a` is the first integer in `info`, `b` is the second integer in `info`, and the value of `suma` minus 2 is printed.*

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is characterized by the following conditions:

*   The value of `T` remains greater than 2, and `t` remains 2.
*   The value of `a` remains the first integer in the input, and `b` remains at least 1.
*   The value of `stdin` remains multiple test cases minus three test cases.
*   The value of `i` is now equal to `b`, indicating that the loop has executed `b` times.
*   The value of `x` is calculated based on the last iteration of the loop, where `i` is equal to `b`.
*   The value of `suma` is increased by the sum of `x` values for all iterations where the condition `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1 > 0` is true. Additionally, `suma` is increased by 1 for iterations where the conditions `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i^2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i^2 == 0` are both true.
*   The value of `suma` minus 2 is being printed.
*   The value of `info` remains a list of two integers, where `a` is the first integer and `b` is the second integer.
