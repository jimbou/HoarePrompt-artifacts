Output State: **`T` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two positive integers n and m, such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases do not exceed 2 * 10^6, but one integer has been removed from the stdin.**

In this output state, `T` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but one integer has been removed from the stdin, which was used to assign the value to `T`. The rest of the test cases remain the same, with each test case containing two positive integers n and m, such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, and the sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases do not exceed 2 * 10^6.
