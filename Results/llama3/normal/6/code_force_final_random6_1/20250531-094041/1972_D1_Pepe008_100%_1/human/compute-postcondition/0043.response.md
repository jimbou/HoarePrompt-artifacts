Output State: **T is greater than 1, t is 1, a is a positive integer, b is greater than 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, x is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i) ** 2 + 1**

The value of x is calculated using the formula ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i) ** 2 + 1, where a is a positive integer, and i is an integer. The values of T, t, a, and b remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.
