Output State: **T is greater than 1, t is 1, a is a positive integer, b is greater than 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, x is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i), suma is increased by ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i)**

In natural language, the output state is: T is still greater than 1, t remains 1, a is still a positive integer, b is still greater than 2, stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, x is still ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i), and suma has been increased by the value of x, which is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i).
