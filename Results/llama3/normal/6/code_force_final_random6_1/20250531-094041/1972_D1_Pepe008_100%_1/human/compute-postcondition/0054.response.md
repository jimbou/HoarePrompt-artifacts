Output State: **`T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `a` is the first integer in the input, `b` is at least 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `i` is 1, `x` is equal to `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1`, `suma` is increased by the sum of `x` values for all iterations where `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1 > 0`, and an additional 1 for iterations where `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i^2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i^2 == 0`, and the value of `suma` minus 2 is being printed, `info` is a list of two integers, `a` is the first integer in `info`, `b` is the second integer in `info`, and `suma` is 0, and the value of `suma` minus 2 is printed**

The value of `x` is updated to `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1`, which is a new expression based on the current values of `a` and `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `suma` is still being increased by the sum of `x` values for all iterations where `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1 > 0`, and an additional 1 for iterations where `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i^2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i^2 == 0`. The value of `suma` minus 2 is still being printed.
