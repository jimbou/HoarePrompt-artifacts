Postcondition: **`T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is at least 1, `suma` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `i` is 1, `x` is equal to `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, and the current value of `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1)` is greater than 0.**
