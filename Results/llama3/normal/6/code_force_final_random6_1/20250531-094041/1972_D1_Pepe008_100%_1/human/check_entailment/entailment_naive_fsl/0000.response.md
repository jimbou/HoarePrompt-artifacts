Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions. The issue lies in the calculation of the variable `x` and the additional condition for incrementing `suma` by 1.

The correct calculation for `x` should be `x = (a - 1) // (i ** 2 // math.gcd(i, a)) + 1`, which takes into account the greatest common divisor of `i` and `a`. The current calculation `x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` is incorrect and does not consider the greatest common divisor.

Additionally, the condition `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` is unnecessary and incorrect. It is not a valid condition for incrementing `suma` by 1.

A correct implementation would involve iterating over all possible values of `a` and `b`, and checking if the conditions `1 ≤ a ≤ n`, `1 ≤ b ≤ m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * math.gcd(a, b)` are satisfied. The correct implementation would also handle the case where `a` and `b` are equal to 1 separately, as the current implementation does not correctly handle this case.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (n, m) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    suma += 1
        print(suma)
```
This corrected version correctly calculates the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions.
