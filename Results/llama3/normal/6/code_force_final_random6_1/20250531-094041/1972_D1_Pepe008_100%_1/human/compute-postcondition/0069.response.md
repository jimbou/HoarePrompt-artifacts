Output State: **`T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `a` is the first integer in the input, `b` is at least 3, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `i` is 3, `x` is equal to `(a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3^2 + 1`, `suma` is increased by the value of `(a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3^2 + 1`, `info` is a list of two integers, `a` is the first integer in `info`, `b` is the second integer in `info`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `suma` has been increased by the value of `x`, which is equal to `(a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3^2 + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
