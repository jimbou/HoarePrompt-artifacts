Postcondition: ***T is greater than 1, t is 1, a is a positive integer, b is greater than 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases. If (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0, then i is 2, x is equal to ((a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2, and suma is equal to suma + ((a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2) + 1. Otherwise, i is 2, x is equal to ((a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2, and suma is equal to suma + ((a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2).***
