Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `a` is the first integer in the input, `b` is at least 3, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `i` is 3, `x` is equal to `(a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3^2 + 1`. If `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0`, then `suma` is increased by the value of `(a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3^2 + 1`. Otherwise, `suma` remains unchanged. `info` is a list of two integers, `a` is the first integer in `info`, `b` is the second integer in `info`.***
