Output: **The value of `suma` minus 2 (where `suma` is the sum of `x` values for all iterations where `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1 > 0`, and an additional 1 for iterations where `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i^2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i^2 == 0`, and `a` is the first integer in the input, `b` is at least 1, and `i` is equal to `b`)**
