Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is at least 1, `suma` is equal to `suma + ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i)`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `i` is 1, and `x` is equal to `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `suma` has been updated by adding the value of `x`, which is calculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, to its previous value. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
