The only variable in the loop head is variable `t` and `T`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. If `T` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `T` is a positive integer does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `T` is greater than 0 and `t` is now 0. 
State: **`T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two positive integers n and m, such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases do not exceed 2 * 10^6, but one integer has been removed from the stdin.**
