Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is at least 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `i` is 2, and `x` is equal to `((a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2) ** 2 + 1`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of T remains greater than 0, t remains 0, a remains a positive integer, b remains at least 2, and there are still multiple test cases minus one in stdin. The value of i remains 2. The value of x is updated to be equal to the square of the integer division of (a - 2) by 2, plus 1.
