Output State: **T is greater than 0, t is 0, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, suma is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**

The code reads a test case from stdin, which contains two positive integers n and m. The first line assigns these integers to the variables a and b, respectively. The second line initializes the variable suma to 0. Since the initial state specifies that one integer has been removed from stdin, the number of test cases in stdin is reduced by one. The values of T and t remain unchanged.
