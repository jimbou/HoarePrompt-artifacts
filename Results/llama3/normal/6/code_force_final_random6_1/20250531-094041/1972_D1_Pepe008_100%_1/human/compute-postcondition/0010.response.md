Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is at least 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `i` is 1, and `x` is equal to `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`. If `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i` is not equal to 0, then `suma` is increased by `x` squared plus 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
