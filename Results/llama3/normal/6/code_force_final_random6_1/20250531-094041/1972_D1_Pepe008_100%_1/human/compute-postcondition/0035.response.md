Postcondition: **T is greater than 1, t is 1, a is a positive integer, b is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, i is 1, x is equal to (a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1, info is a list of two integers, a is the first integer in info, b is the second integer in info. If the expression (a - i * (i - 1)) is perfectly divisible by i^2 and the expression i * (i - 1) is also perfectly divisible by i^2, then suma is increased by the value of x which is a + 2. Otherwise, if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1 > 0, then suma is increased by the value of x which is a + 1. The value of suma minus 2 is being printed.**
