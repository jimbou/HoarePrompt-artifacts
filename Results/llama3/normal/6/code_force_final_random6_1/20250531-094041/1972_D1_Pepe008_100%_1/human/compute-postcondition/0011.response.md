To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `b`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `b`. If `i` is less than `b`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `b` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Since `b` is at least 1, it must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is at least 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `i` is 2, and `x` is equal to `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i**
