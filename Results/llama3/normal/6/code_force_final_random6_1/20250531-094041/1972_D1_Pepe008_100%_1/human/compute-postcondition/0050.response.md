Output: **T is greater than 1, t is 1, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, i is equal to b, x is equal to (a - b * (b - 1)) // b^2 + 1, suma is increased by the sum of x values for all iterations where (a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1 > 0, and an additional 1 for iterations where (a - i * (i - 1)) % i^2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i^2 == 0, and the value of suma minus 2 is being printed, info is a list of two integers, a is the first integer in info, b is the second integer in info, and suma is 0, and the value of suma minus 2 is printed**
