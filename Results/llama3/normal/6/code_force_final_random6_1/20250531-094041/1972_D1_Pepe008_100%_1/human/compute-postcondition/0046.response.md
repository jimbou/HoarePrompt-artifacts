Postcondition: ***T is greater than 1, t is 1, a is a positive integer, b is greater than 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, x is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i), suma is increased by ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i). If (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0, then suma is increased by ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i) + 1. Otherwise, suma remains unchanged.***
