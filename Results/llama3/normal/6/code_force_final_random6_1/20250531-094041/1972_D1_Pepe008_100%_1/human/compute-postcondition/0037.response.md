Output State: **T is greater than 1, t is 1, a is a positive integer, b is greater than 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, i is 2, x is equal to ((a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2 ** 2 + 1), info is a list of two integers, a is the first integer in info, b is the second integer in info**

In this output state, the value of x has been updated to ((a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2 ** 2 + 1), which is a new expression that takes into account the current values of a and i. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.
