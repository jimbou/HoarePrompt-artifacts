Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is at least 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `i` is 2, `x` is equal to `((a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2)`. If `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0`, then `suma` is increased by `((a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2) + 1`.***
