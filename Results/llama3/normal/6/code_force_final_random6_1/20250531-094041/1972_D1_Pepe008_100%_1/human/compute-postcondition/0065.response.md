Postcondition: **`T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `a` is the first integer in the input, `b` is at least 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `i` is 2, `x` is equal to `(a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2^2 + 1`, `suma` is increased by the value of `x` if `(a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2^2 + 1 > 0`, otherwise `suma` remains unchanged, `info` is a list of two integers, `a` is the first integer in `info`, `b` is the second integer in `info`. If `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0`, then `suma` is increased by 1 and the value of `suma` minus 1 is being printed. Otherwise, the value of `suma` minus 2 is being printed.**
