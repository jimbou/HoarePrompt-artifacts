Postcondition: ***T is greater than 0, t is 0, a is a positive integer, b is at least 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, i is 3, x is equal to ((a - 3 * 2) // 9 + 1). If (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0, then suma is increased by ((a - 3 * 2) // 9 + 2). Otherwise, suma is increased by ((a - 3 * 2) // 9 + 1).***
