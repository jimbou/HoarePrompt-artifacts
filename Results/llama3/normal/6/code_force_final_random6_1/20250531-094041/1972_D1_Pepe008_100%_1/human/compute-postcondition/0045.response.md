Output State: **T is greater than 1, t is 1, a is a positive integer, b is greater than 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, x is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i), suma is increased by ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i) + 1**

In natural language, the output state is: T is still greater than 1, t remains 1, a is still a positive integer, b is still greater than 2, the number of test cases in stdin has not changed, x is still equal to the expression ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i), and suma has been increased by 1 in addition to the previous increase by ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i).
