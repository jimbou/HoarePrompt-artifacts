Output State: **T is greater than 1, t is 1, a is a positive integer, b is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, i is 1, x is equal to (a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1, suma is increased by the value of x which is a + 2, info is a list of two integers, a is the first integer in info, b is the second integer in info, and the value of suma minus 2 is being printed. Additionally, the expression (a - i * (i - 1)) is perfectly divisible by i^2, and the expression i * (i - 1) is also perfectly divisible by i^2.**

In natural language, the output state is: T is still greater than 1, t remains 1, a is still a positive integer, b is at least 1, there are still multiple test cases minus two test cases in stdin, i is still 1, x is still equal to (a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1, suma has been increased by 1, info is still a list of two integers with a as the first integer and b as the second integer, and the value of suma minus 2 is being printed. Also, the expression (a - i * (i - 1)) is still perfectly divisible by i^2, and the expression i * (i - 1) is also still perfectly divisible by i^2.
