The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and b, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `b`. If `i` is less than `b`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `b` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `b` must be greater than 2.
State: **T is greater than 1, t is 1, a is a positive integer, b is greater than 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases. If (a - i * (i - 1)) // i**
