Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is at least 1, `suma` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `i` is 1, `x` is equal to `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` which is `(a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1 ** 2 + 1` which is `(a - 0) // 1 + 1` which is `a + 1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: T is greater than 0, t is 0, a is a positive integer, b is at least 1, suma is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, i is 1, and x is equal to a + 1.
