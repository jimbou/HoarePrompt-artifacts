Postcondition: ***T is greater than 0, t is 0, a is a positive integer, b is at least 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, i is 3, x is equal to ((a - 3 * 2) // 9 + 1). If (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0, then the function executes the if part. Otherwise, the function does nothing.***
