Output State: **`T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `a` is the first integer in the input, `b` is at least 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `i` is 1, `x` is equal to `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1`, `suma` is increased by the value of `x`, `info` is a list of two integers, `a` is the first integer in `info`, `b` is the second integer in `info`, and the value of `suma` minus 2 is being printed.**

In this output state, the value of `suma` has been increased by the value of `x`, which is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `suma` minus 2 is still being printed.
