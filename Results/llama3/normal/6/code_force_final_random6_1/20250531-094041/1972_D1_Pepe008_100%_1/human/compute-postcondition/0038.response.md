Output State: **T is greater than 1, t is 1, a is a positive integer, b is greater than 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, i is 2, x is equal to ((a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2, suma is equal to suma + ((a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2)**

In natural language, the output state is: T is still greater than 1, t remains 1, a is still a positive integer, b is still greater than 1, stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, i is still 2, x is still equal to ((a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2, and suma has been updated to be the sum of its previous value and ((a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2.
