Output State: **T is greater than 1, t is 1, a is a positive integer, b is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, i is 1, x is equal to (a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1, suma is increased by the value of x which is a + 1, info is a list of two integers, a is the first integer in info, b is the second integer in info, and the value of suma minus 2 is being printed.**

In this output state, the value of suma has been increased by the value of x, which is a + 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of suma is now equal to the sum of x values for all iterations where (a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1 > 0, plus an additional 1 for iterations where (a - i * (i - 1)) % i^2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i^2 == 0, plus the value of x which is a + 1.
