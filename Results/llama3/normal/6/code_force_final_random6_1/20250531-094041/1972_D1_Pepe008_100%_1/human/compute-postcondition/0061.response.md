To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `b`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `b + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `b` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `b` remains the same.

State: **`T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `a` is the first integer in the input, `b` is at least 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `i` is 2, `x` is equal to `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1`, `suma` is increased by the value of `x` if `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1 > 0`, otherwise `suma` remains unchanged, `info` is a list of two integers, `a` is the first integer in `info`, `b` is the second integer in `info`, and the value of `suma` minus 2 is being printed.**
