Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is at least 1, `suma` is equal to `suma + ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i) + 1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `i` is 1, and `x` is equal to `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `suma` has been incremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The condition `((a - i * (i - 1)) % i == 0)` is still satisfied, and `i` is still equal to 1. The number of test cases in `stdin` remains the same, minus one test case.
