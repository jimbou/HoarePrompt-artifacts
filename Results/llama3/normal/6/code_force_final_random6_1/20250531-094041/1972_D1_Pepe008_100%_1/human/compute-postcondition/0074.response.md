Output State: *`T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `a` is the first integer in the input, `b` is at least 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `i` is equal to `b`, `x` is equal to `(a - b * (b - 1)) // b^2 + 1`, `suma` is increased by the sum of `x` values for all iterations where `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1 > 0`, and an additional 1 for iterations where `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i^2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i^2 == 0`, `info` is a list of two integers, `a` is the first integer in `info`, `b` is the second integer in `info`, and the value of `suma` minus 2 is being printed.*

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: The loop has finished executing, and the value of `i` is now equal to `b`. The value of `x` is calculated based on the current values of `a` and `b`. The `suma` variable has been updated by adding the sum of `x` values for all iterations where the condition `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1 > 0` is true, and an additional 1 for iterations where `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i^2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i^2 == 0`. The other variables remain unchanged.
