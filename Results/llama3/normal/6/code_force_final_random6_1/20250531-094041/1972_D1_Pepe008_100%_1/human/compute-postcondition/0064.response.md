Output State: **`T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `a` is the first integer in the input, `b` is at least 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `i` is 2, `x` is equal to `(a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2^2 + 1`, `suma` is increased by 1, `info` is a list of two integers, `a` is the first integer in `info`, `b` is the second integer in `info`, and the value of `suma` minus 1 is being printed.**

In this output state, the value of `suma` has been increased by 1, and the rest of the variables remain unchanged. The value of `suma` minus 1 is being printed, indicating that the previous value of `suma` minus 2 is no longer being printed.
