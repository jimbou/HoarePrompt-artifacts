Output State: **`T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `a` is the first integer in the input, `b` is at least 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `i` is 2, `x` is equal to `(a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2^2 + 1`, `suma` is increased by the value of `x` if `(a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2^2 + 1 > 0`, otherwise `suma` remains unchanged, `info` is a list of two integers, `a` is the first integer in `info`, `b` is the second integer in `info`, and the value of `suma` minus 2 is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `T` is still greater than 2, `t` is still 2, `a` is still the first integer in the input, `b` is still at least 1, and `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus three test cases. The value of `i` is still 2. The value of `x` has been updated to `(a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2^2 + 1`, which is equivalent to `(a - 2) // 4 + 1`. The value of `suma` has been updated to be increased by the value of `x` if `(a - 2) // 4 + 1 > 0`, otherwise it remains unchanged. The value of `info` is still a list of two integers, where `a` is the first integer and `b` is the second integer. The value of `suma` minus 2 is still being printed.
