To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `b`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `b + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `b` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. Since `b` is at least 1, it must be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `a` is the first integer in the input, `b` is at least 3, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `i` is 3, `x` is equal to `(a - 2 * (3 - 1)) // 2^2 + 1`, `suma` is increased by the value of `x` if `(a - 2 * (3 - 1)) // 2^2 + 1 > 0`, otherwise `suma` remains unchanged, `info` is a list of two integers, `a` is the first integer in `info`, `b` is the second integer in `info`.**
