Output State: **T is greater than 1, t is 1, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, i is equal to b, x is equal to (a - b * (b - 1)) // b^2 + 1, suma is increased by the sum of x values for all iterations where (a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1 > 0, and an additional 1 for iterations where (a - i * (i - 1)) % i^2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i^2 == 0, and the value of suma minus 2 is being printed, info is a list of two integers, a is the first integer in info, b is the second integer in info, and suma is 0.**

Explanation: The code reads a line from stdin, splits it into two integers, and assigns them to a and b. It then initializes suma to 0. The initial state of T, t, i, x, and the conditions for suma remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The only changes are the assignment of values to a and b, the initialization of suma, and the reduction of test cases in stdin by one.
