The only variable in the loop head is variable  t and T, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable T and t. If t is less than T, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, T is greater than 0, t is 0. For the loop to execute again t is increased by 1 so t is 1 and for the loop to execute again T must be greater than 1.
State: **T is greater than 1, t is 1, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, i is equal to b, x is equal to (a - b * (b - 1)) // b^2 + 1, and suma is increased by the sum of x values for all iterations where (a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1 > 0, and an additional 1 for iterations where (a - i * (i - 1)) % i^2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i^2 == 0, and the value of suma minus 2 is being printed**
