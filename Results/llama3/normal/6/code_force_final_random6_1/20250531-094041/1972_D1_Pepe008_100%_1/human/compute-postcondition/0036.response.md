The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and b, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `b`. If `i` is less than `b`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `b` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `b` must be greater than 1.
State: **T is greater than 1, t is 1, a is a positive integer, b is greater than 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, i is 2, x is equal to (a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1, info is a list of two integers, a is the first integer in info, b is the second integer in info**
