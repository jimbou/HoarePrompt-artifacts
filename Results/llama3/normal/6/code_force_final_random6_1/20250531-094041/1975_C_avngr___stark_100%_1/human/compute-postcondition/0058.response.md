Output State: **t is at least 1, n is an integer between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), i is 0, temp is a sorted list of three integers from the list a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, and the current value of max is equal to the second element of temp.**

In this output state, the value of max has been updated to be equal to the second element of temp, which is greater than its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged.
