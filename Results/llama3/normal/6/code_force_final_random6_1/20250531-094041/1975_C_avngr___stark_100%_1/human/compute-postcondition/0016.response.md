Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^5 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `max` is the second element of `temp`, `i` is 1, `temp` is a sorted list of three integers from the list `a`, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines.**

In this output state, the value of `max` has been updated to be the second element of the sorted list `temp`, which is a list of three integers from the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines.
