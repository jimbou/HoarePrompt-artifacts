Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `max` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines. If `n` is 2, the minimum of the list `a` is printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no specific action is taken.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `max` is initialized to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines. The condition for printing the minimum of the list `a` when `n` is 2 and skipping to the next iteration of the loop remains the same.
