Postcondition: ***t is at least 1, n is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), i is n - 2, temp is a sorted list of three integers from the list a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, and max is the maximum of the second elements of all temp lists. If n is 2, the minimum value of the list a is being printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
