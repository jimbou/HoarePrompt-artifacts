Output State: **t is at least 1, n is an integer between 4 and 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), i is 2, temp is a sorted list of three integers from the list a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, and max is equal to the second element of temp if the second element of temp is greater than the original value of max, otherwise max remains unchanged.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns a slice of the list `a` starting from index `i` (which is 2) and ending at index `i + 3` (which is 5) to the variable `temp`. This means `temp` now holds a list of three integers from `a` starting from the third element (since indexing starts at 0).

The second line sorts the list `temp` in ascending order. This means the three integers in `temp` are now arranged from smallest to largest.

No other variables are affected by this code snippet. The value of `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `stdin`, and `max` remain unchanged. The only change is that `temp` now holds a sorted list of three integers from `a`.
