Output State: **t is at least 1, n is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), i is n - 2, temp is a sorted list of three integers from the list a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, and max is the maximum value of the second elements of all the sorted sublists of three consecutive integers from the list a.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `max` will be the maximum value of the second elements of all the sorted sublists of three consecutive integers from the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
