Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (2 <= n <= 10^5). The second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if n == 2:
        print(min(a))
        continue
    max = 0
    for i in range(n - 2):
        temp = a[i:i + 3]
        temp.sort()
        if temp[1] > max:
            max = temp[1]
    print(max)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is at least 1, n is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), max is the maximum of the second elements of all temp lists, i is n - 2, temp is a sorted list of three integers from the list a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, and the maximum of the second elements of all temp lists which is max is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is at least 2, n is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), i is n - 2, temp is a sorted list of three integers from the list a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, and max is the maximum of the second elements of all temp lists, and the maximum of the second elements of all temp lists which is max is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is at least 1, n is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), i is n - 2, temp is a sorted list of three integers from the list a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, and max is the maximum value of the second elements of all the sorted sublists of three consecutive integers from the list a, and the maximum value of the second elements of all the sorted sublists of three consecutive integers from the list a which is max is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
