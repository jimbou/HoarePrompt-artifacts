Postcondition: ***t is at least 1, n is an integer between 5 and 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), i is 2, temp is a sorted list of three integers from the list a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, max is the second element of temp if it is greater than max, otherwise max remains unchanged.***
