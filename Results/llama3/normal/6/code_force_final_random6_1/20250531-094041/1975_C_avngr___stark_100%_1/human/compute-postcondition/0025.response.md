The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t. If t is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, t must be at least 2.
State: **t is at least 2, n is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), max is the maximum of the second elements of all temp lists, i is n - 2, temp is a sorted list of three integers from the list a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, and the maximum of the second elements of all temp lists which is max is being printed**
