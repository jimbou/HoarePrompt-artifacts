Postcondition: ***t is at least 2, n is an integer between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), i is 0, temp is a sorted list of the first three integers from the list a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines. If the second element of temp is greater than max, then max is updated to be equal to temp[1].***
