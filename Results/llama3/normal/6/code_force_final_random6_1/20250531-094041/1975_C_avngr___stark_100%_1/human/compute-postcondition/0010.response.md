The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns a slice of the list `a` to the variable `temp`. The slice starts at index `i` and ends at index `i + 3`. Since `i` is 0, the slice includes the first three elements of the list `a`. The second line sorts the list `temp` in ascending order.

Output State: **t is at least 1, n is an integer between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), max is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, i is 0, temp is a sorted list of three integers from the list a**
