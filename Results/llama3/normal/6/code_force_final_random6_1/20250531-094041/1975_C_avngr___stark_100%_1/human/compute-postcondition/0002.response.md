Output State: **t is at least 1, n is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines.**

This output state reflects the combined effect of the two lines of code on the initial state. The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`, which is now an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive). The second line reads a list of `n` space-separated integers from stdin and assigns it to `a`, which is now a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). The value of `t` remains unchanged, as it is not affected by the code. Stdin now contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, as two lines have been read and processed by the code.
