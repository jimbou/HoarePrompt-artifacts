The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is between 4 and 10^5 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 4.
State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer between 5 and 10^5 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `temp` is a sorted list of three integers from the list `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines. If the second element of `temp` is greater than `max`, then `max` is updated to the second element of `temp`. Otherwise, `max` remains unchanged.**
