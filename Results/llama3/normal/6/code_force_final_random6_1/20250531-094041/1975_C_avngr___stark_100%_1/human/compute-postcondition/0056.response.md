Output State: **t is at least 1, n is an integer between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), i is 0, temp is a sorted list of three integers from the list a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, and max is 0**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns a slice of the list `a` to the variable `temp`. The slice includes the elements at indices `i` to `i + 3`. Since `i` is 0, this means `temp` will contain the first three elements of `a`. The second line sorts the list `temp` in ascending order.

After executing the code, the variable `temp` will contain a sorted list of three integers from the list `a`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The value of `t` is still at least 1, `n` is still an integer between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive), `a` is still a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is still 0, `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, and `max` is still 0.
