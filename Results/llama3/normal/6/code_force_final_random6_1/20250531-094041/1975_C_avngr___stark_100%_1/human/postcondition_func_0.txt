This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a single integer n followed by n space-separated integers. For each test case, it finds the maximum value of the second elements of all sorted sublists of three consecutive integers from the list, and prints this maximum value. If a test case has only two integers, it simply prints the smaller of the two. The function processes all test cases and prints the maximum values for each case.
