To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which in this case is only the variable `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be decreased by 1.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is `n - 2`, `temp` is a sorted list of three integers from the list `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, and `max` is the maximum of the second elements of all `temp` lists**
