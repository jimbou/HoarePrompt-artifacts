Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer between 5 and 10^5 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `temp` is a sorted list of three integers from the list `a`, `max` is the second element of `temp`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines.**

In natural language, the output state is: the value of `t` remains at least 1, the value of `n` remains between 5 and 10^5 (inclusive), the list `a` remains unchanged with `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), the value of `i` remains 2, the list `temp` remains a sorted list of three integers from the list `a`, the value of `max` is updated to the second element of `temp`, and the stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines.
