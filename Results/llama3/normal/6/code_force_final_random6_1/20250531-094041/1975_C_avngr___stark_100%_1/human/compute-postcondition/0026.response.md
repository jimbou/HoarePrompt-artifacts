Output State: **t is at least 2, n is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), max is the maximum of the second elements of all temp lists, i is n - 2, temp is a sorted list of three integers from the list a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, and the maximum of the second elements of all temp lists which is max is being printed, n is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive)**

The code reads two lines from stdin, assigning the first line to `n` and the second line to `a`. The value of `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), and `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). The rest of the variables (`t`, `max`, `i`, `temp`) remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the code. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines.
