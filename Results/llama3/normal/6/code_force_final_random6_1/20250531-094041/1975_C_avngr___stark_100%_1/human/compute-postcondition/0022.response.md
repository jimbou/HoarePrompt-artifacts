Output State: **t is at least 1, n is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), max is the maximum of the second elements of all temp lists, i is n - 2, temp is a sorted list of three integers from the list a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `t` remains at least 1, the value of `n` remains between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), the list `a` remains unchanged, the value of `max` is updated to the maximum of the second elements of all `temp` lists, the value of `i` is `n - 2`, the list `temp` is a sorted list of three integers from the list `a`, and the stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines.
