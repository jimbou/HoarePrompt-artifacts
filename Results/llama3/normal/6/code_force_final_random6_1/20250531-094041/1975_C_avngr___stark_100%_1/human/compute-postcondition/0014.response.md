To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^5 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `max` is either 0 or the second element of `temp`, `i` is 1, `temp` is a sorted list of three integers from the list `a`, and the current value of `max` is either 0 or equal to the second element of `temp`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines.**
