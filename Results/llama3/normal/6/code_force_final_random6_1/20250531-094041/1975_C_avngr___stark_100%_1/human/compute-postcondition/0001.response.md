According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is at least 1.
State: **`t` is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (2 <= n <= 10^5). The second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9)**
