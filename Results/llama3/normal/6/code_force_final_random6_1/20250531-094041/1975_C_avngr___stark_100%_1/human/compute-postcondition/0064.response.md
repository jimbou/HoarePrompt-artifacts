The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n-2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 4.
State: **t is at least 1, n is an integer between 4 and 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), i is 2, temp is a sorted list of three integers from the list a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, and max is equal to the second element of temp if the second element of temp is greater than the original value of max, otherwise max remains unchanged.**
