Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines. If `n` is 2, the minimum of the list `a` is printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no specific action is taken.**
