Output State: **t is at least 2, n is an integer between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), max is equal to temp[1], i is 0, temp is a sorted list of the first three integers from the list a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of max has been updated to be equal to the second element of the sorted list temp, which is currently higher than the previous value of max. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
