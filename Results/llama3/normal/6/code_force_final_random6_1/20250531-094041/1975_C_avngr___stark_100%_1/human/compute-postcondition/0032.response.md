To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 3 (since `n - 2` should be greater than 0 for the loop to run). 

State: **`t` is at least 2, `n` is an integer between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `max` is 0, `i` is 0, `temp` is a sorted list of three integers from the list `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines**
