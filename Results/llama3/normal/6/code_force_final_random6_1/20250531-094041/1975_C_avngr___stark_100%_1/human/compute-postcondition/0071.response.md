Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (2 <= n <= 10^5). The second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), and the maximum value of the second elements of all the sorted sublists of three consecutive integers from the list a which is max is being printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop executes all the iterations, the initial state remains unchanged, and the maximum value of the second elements of all the sorted sublists of three consecutive integers from the list a is being printed.
