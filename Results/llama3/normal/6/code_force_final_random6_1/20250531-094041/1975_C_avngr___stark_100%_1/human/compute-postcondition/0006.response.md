Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is 2, `a` is a list of 2 integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, and the minimum of the list `a` is being printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines. The minimum of the list `a` is still being printed. However, the `continue` statement causes the program to skip to the next iteration of the loop, without executing any further statements in the current iteration.
