Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `max` is 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `temp` is a sorted list of three integers from the list `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines. If `n` is 2, the smallest integer in the list `a` is being printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the maximum of the second elements of all temp lists which is `max` is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `max` has been reset to 0. All other variables retain their previous values. The program is still in the same loop iteration, and the conditions for printing the smallest integer in the list `a` or the maximum of the second elements of all temp lists still apply.
