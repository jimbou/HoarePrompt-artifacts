Based on the precondition, the list `a` contains `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). The `print` statement is printing the minimum value of the list `a`.

Since the list `a` contains integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), the minimum value of the list `a` will be at least 1.

Output: **the minimum value of the list a, which is at least 1**
