Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `temp` is a sorted list of three integers from the list `a`, `max` is equal to the second element of `temp`, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines.**

In this output state, the value of `max` has been updated to be equal to the second element of `temp`, which is a sorted list of three integers from the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, indicating that two lines of input have been processed.
