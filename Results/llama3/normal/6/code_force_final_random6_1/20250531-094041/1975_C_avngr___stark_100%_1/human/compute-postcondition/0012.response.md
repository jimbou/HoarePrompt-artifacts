Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `max` is the second element of `temp`, `i` is 0, `temp` is a sorted list of three integers from the list `a`, and the current value of `max` is equal to the second element of `temp`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines.**

In natural language, the output state is that the value of `max` has been updated to be the second element of the sorted list `temp`, which is a subset of the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged, with `t` still being at least 1, `n` still being between 3 and 10^5, `a` still being a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `i` still being 0, and `temp` still being a sorted list of three integers from `a`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines.
