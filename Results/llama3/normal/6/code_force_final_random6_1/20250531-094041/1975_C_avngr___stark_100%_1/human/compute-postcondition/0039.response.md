Output State: **t is at least 2, n is an integer between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), i is 1, temp is a sorted list of the next three integers from the list a, max is the second element of temp, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines.**

In this output state, the value of max is updated to be equal to the second element of temp, which is the middle element of the sorted list of the next three integers from the list a. The other variables remain unchanged.
