Output State: **t is at least 2, n is an integer between 4 and 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), i is 2, temp is a sorted list of the next three integers from the list a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, and max is the second element of temp.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of t is at least 2, the value of n is between 4 and 10^5 (inclusive), the list a contains n integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), the value of i is 2, the list temp is a sorted list of the next three integers from the list a, the stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, and the value of max is the second element of temp.
