To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 3, the loop can execute.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `temp` is a sorted list of three integers from the list `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, and `max` is 0**
