The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains multiple test cases, and the first input is the number of test cases `t`. After reading this input, the stdin still contains the multiple test cases.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (2 <= n <= 10^5). The second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).**
