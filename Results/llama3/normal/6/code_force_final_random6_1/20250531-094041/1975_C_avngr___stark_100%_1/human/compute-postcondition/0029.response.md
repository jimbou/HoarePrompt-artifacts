Output State: **t is at least 2, n is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), max is the maximum of the second elements of all temp lists, i is n - 2, temp is a sorted list of three integers from the list a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, and the maximum of the second elements of all temp lists which is max is being printed, n is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), and the smallest integer in the list a is being printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `max`, `i`, `temp`, and the contents of `stdin` remain unchanged.
