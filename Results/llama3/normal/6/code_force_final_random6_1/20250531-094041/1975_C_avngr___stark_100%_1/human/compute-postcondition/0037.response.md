To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(n - 2):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 2`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an integer between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive).

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.

The value of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

The other variables, `t`, `a`, `temp`, and `stdin`, are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is at least 2, `n` is an integer between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `temp` is a sorted list of the first three integers from the list `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines. If the second element of `temp` is greater than `max`, then `max` is updated to be equal to `temp[1]`.**
