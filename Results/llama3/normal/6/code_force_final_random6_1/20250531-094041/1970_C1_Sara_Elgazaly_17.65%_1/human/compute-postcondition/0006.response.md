Output State: **x is an integer between 3 and 199999 inclusive, y is 1, lst is a dictionary with default value of empty list where lst[a] contains b and lst[b] contains a, and also lst[u] contains v and lst[v] contains u, and also lst[a] contains b and lst[b] contains a, stdin contains n-5 lines each containing two integers u and v, and finally one integer u_1**

In this output state, the value of x remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The value of y also remains the same, which is 1. The dictionary lst has been updated to include the new key-value pairs [a, b] and [b, a]. The stdin now contains n-5 lines, each containing two integers u and v, and finally one integer u_1.
