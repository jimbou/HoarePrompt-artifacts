Output State: **`x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `lst` is a dictionary with default value of empty list where `lst[a]` contains `b` and `lst[b]` contains `a`, and also `lst[u]` contains `v` and `lst[v]` contains `u`, and so on for all pairs of integers in stdin, `lst[x]` is empty, `s` is False, stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `x` and `y` are integers, the dictionary `lst` still contains pairs of integers as before, but the list associated with `x` is now empty. The variable `s` remains False, and there is no input in stdin.
