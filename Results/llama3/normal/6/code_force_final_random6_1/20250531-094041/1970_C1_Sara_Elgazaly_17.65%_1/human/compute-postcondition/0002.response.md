Output State: **x is an integer between 3 and 200000 inclusive, y is 1, lst is a dictionary with default value of empty list where lst[a] contains b and lst[b] contains a, stdin contains n-2 lines each containing two integers u and v, and finally one integer u_1**

In this output state, the value of x remains unchanged as it was not modified by the code. The value of y also remains the same as it was not affected by the code. The dictionary lst has been updated to include the values a and b, where lst[a] now contains b and lst[b] now contains a. The stdin has been modified to contain n-2 lines each containing two integers u and v, and finally one integer u_1, as one line has been read and processed by the code.
