Output State: **`x` is an integer that was associated with 1, `y` is an integer that was associated with `x` and is one of the elements of `lst[x]`, `lst` is a dictionary with default value of empty list where `lst[a]` contains `b` and `lst[b]` contains `a`, and also `lst[u]` contains `v` and `lst[v]` contains `u`, and so on for all pairs of integers in stdin, but `lst[x]` is not empty and has at least 1 element, `s` is True, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been updated to be one of the elements of `lst[x]`, which was popped from the list. The other variables remain unchanged. The dictionary `lst` still contains the same pairs of integers, but `lst[x]` now has one less element. The value of `s` is still True, and there is no input in stdin.
