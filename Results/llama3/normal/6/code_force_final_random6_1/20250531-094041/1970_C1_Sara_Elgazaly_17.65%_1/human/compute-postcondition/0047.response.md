Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer, `y` is an integer that was previously in `lst[x]`, `lst` is a dictionary with default value of empty list where `lst[a]` contains `b` and `lst[b]` contains `a`, and also `lst[u]` contains `v` and `lst[v]` contains `u`, and so on for all pairs of integers, `lst[x]` contains one less element than before, `s` is True, stdin contains no input. If `lst[y]` is not an empty list, then `x` is equal to `y`.***
