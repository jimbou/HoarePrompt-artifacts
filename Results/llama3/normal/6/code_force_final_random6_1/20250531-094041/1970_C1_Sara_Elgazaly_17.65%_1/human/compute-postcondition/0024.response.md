Output State: **`x` is an integer that was associated with 1, `y` is an integer that was associated with `x` and is one of the elements of `lst[x]`, `lst` is a dictionary with default value of empty list where `lst[a]` contains `b` and `lst[b]` contains `a`, and also `lst[u]` contains `v` and `lst[v]` contains `u`, and so on for all pairs of integers in stdin, but `lst[x]` is empty, `s` is False, stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `x`, `y`, and `lst` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that the value of `s` is now False, which is the opposite of its initial value True. The stdin still contains no input.
