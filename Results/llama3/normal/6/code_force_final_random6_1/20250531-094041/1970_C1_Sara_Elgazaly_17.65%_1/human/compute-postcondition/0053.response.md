Output State: **`x` is an integer that was previously in a pair, `y` is an integer that was previously in `lst[x]` and also in `lst[y]`, `lst` is a dictionary with default value of empty list where `lst[a]` contains `b` and `lst[b]` contains `a`, and also `lst[u]` contains `v` and `lst[v]` contains `u`, and so on for all pairs of integers. If `lst[y]` is not empty, then `x` is an integer that was previously in `lst[y]`, `lst[x]` is empty, `lst[y]` does not contain `x`, and `s` is True. Otherwise, `y` is an integer that was previously in `lst[x]` and also in `lst[y]`, `lst[x]` is empty, `lst[y]` contains `x`, and `s` is False. In both cases, `stdin` contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been updated to be the last element in `lst[x]` before it was popped. If `lst[y]` is not empty, then `x` was previously in `lst[y]`, and `lst[x]` is now empty because the last element was popped. Also, `lst[y]` does not contain `x` anymore because `x` was removed from `lst[y]`. The value of `s` is True in this case. If `lst[y]` is empty, then `y` is still an integer that was previously in `lst[x]` and also in `lst[y]`, and `lst[x]` is now empty because the last element was popped. The value of `s` is False in this case. The stdin contains no input in both cases.
