Output State: **`x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `lst` is a dictionary with default value of empty list where `lst[a]` contains `b` and `lst[b]` contains `a`, and also `lst[u]` contains `v` and `lst[v]` contains `u`, and so on for all pairs of integers, `lst[x]` is empty, `s` is False, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been changed to `False` because the code `s = not s` negates the original value of `s`, which was `True`. The other variables remain unchanged, including `x`, `y`, and `lst`, which retain their original values and properties. The stdin still contains no input.
