Output State: **`x` is an integer that was previously in a pair, `y` is an integer that was previously in `lst[x]` and also in `lst[y]`, `lst` is a dictionary with default value of empty list where `lst[a]` contains `b` and `lst[b]` contains `a`, and also `lst[u]` contains `v` and `lst[v]` contains `u`, and so on for all pairs of integers. `x` is equal to `y` and `lst[x]` is empty, `s` is False, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been changed to False because the code `s = not s` negates the original value of `s`, which was True. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
