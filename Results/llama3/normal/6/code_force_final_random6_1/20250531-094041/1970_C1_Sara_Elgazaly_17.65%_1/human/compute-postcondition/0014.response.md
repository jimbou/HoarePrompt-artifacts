Postcondition: ***x is an integer that was associated with 1, y is an integer that was associated with 1, lst is a dictionary with default value of empty list where lst[a] contains b and lst[b] contains a, and also lst[u] contains v and lst[v] contains u, and so on for all pairs of integers in stdin, but lst[1] contains at least one integer less than before, s is True, stdin contains no input. If lst[y] is not an empty list, then x is equal to y. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
