Output State: **x is an integer between 4 and 200000 inclusive, y is 1, lst is a dictionary with default value of empty list where lst[a] contains b and lst[b] contains a, and also lst[u] contains v and lst[v] contains u, stdin contains n-4 lines each containing two integers u and v, and finally one integer u_1**

In this output state, the value of `x` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `y` also remains the same, which is 1. The dictionary `lst` is updated with new key-value pairs. Initially, `lst[a]` contained `b` and `lst[b]` contained `a`. After the code execution, `lst[u]` now contains `v` and `lst[v]` contains `u`. The state of `stdin` is also updated, as two lines of input have been consumed, leaving `n-4` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and finally one integer `u_1`.
