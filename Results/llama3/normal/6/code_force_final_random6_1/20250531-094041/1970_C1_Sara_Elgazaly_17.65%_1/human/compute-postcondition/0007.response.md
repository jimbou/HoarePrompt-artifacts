Output State: **x is 1, y is 1, lst is a dictionary with default value of empty list where lst[a] contains b and lst[b] contains a, and also lst[u] contains v and lst[v] contains u, and also lst[a] contains b and lst[b] contains a, and so on for all pairs of integers in stdin, stdin contains one integer u_1**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that x is 1, y remains 1, and the dictionary lst contains all pairs of integers from the input, with each pair connected to each other. The stdin now only contains one integer u_1.
