Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer that was previously in a pair, `y` is an integer that was previously in `lst[x]` and also in `lst[y]`, `lst` is a dictionary with default value of empty list where `lst[a]` contains `b` and `lst[b]` contains `a`, and also `lst[u]` contains `v` and `lst[v]` contains `u`, and so on for all pairs of integers. If `lst[y]` is not empty, then `x` is an integer that was previously in `lst[y]`, `lst[x]` is empty, `lst[y]` contains `x`, and `s` is True. Otherwise, no changes are made. In both cases, `stdin` contains no input.***
