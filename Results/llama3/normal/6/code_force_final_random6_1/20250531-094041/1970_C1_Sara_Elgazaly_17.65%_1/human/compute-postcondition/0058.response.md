Output State: **x is an integer, y is an integer, lst is a dictionary with default value of empty list where lst[a] contains b and lst[b] contains a, and also lst[u] contains v and lst[v] contains u, and so on for all pairs of integers, lst[x] is empty, s is True, stdin contains no input.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that x is an integer, y is an integer, lst is a dictionary with default value of empty list where lst[a] contains b and lst[b] contains a, and also lst[u] contains v and lst[v] contains u, and so on for all pairs of integers, lst[x] is empty, s is True, and stdin contains no input.
