Output State: **`x` is an integer that was associated with 1, `y` is an integer that was associated with `x` and is one of the elements of `lst[x]`, `lst` is a dictionary with default value of empty list where `lst[a]` contains `b` and `lst[b]` contains `a`, and also `lst[u]` contains `v` and `lst[v]` contains `u`, and so on for all pairs of integers in stdin, `lst[x]` is not empty and contains `y`, `s` is False, stdin contains no input, and `y` is removed from `lst[x]`.**

In this output state, the value of `y` is updated to be the popped element from `lst[x]`, and `lst[x]` is updated to not contain `y` anymore. The other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
