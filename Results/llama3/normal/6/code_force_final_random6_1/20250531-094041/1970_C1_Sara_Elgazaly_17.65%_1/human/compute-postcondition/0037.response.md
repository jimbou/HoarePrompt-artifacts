Output State: **`x` is an integer that was associated with 1, `y` is an integer that was associated with `x` and is one of the elements of `lst[x]`, `lst` is a dictionary with default value of empty list where `lst[a]` contains `b` and `lst[b]` contains `a`, and also `lst[u]` contains `v` and `lst[v]` contains `u`, and so on for all pairs of integers in stdin, `lst[x]` had more than one element and is not empty, `s` is False, stdin contains no input, and `y` is removed from `lst[x]`. If `lst[y]` is not empty, then `x` is an integer that was associated with `y`, `y` is an integer that was associated with `x` and is one of the elements of `lst[y]`, `lst` is a dictionary with default value of empty list where `lst[a]` contains `b` and `lst[b]` contains `a`, and also `lst[u]` contains `v` and `lst[v]` contains `u`, and so on for all pairs of integers in stdin, `lst[y]` is not empty and contains `x`, `s` is False, stdin contains no input. Otherwise, no changes are made.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows: The value of `y` is updated to be the last element of `lst[x]` and is removed from `lst[x]`. If `lst[y]` is not empty, then `x` and `y` are swapped, and `x` is now associated with `y`, and `y` is now associated with `x`. The rest of the state remains the same.
