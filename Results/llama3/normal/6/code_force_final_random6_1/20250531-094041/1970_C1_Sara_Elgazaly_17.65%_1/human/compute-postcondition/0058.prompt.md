Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `x` is 1, `y` is 1, `lst` is a dictionary with default value of empty list where `lst[a]` contains `b` and `lst[b]` contains `a`, and also `lst[u]` contains `v` and `lst[v]` contains `u`, and also `lst[a]` contains `b` and `lst[b]` contains `a`, and so on for all pairs of integers in stdin, `s` is True, stdin contains one integer `u_1`.
Code of the loop:
while lst[x] != []:
    while lst[x]:
        y = lst[x].pop()
        if lst[y] != []:
            x = y
            break
    s = not s


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `x` is an integer that was associated with 1, `y` is an integer that was associated with `x` and is one of the elements of `lst[x]`, `lst` is a dictionary with default value of empty list where `lst[a]` contains `b` and `lst[b]` contains `a`, and also `lst[u]` contains `v` and `lst[v]` contains `u`, and so on for all pairs of integers in stdin, but `lst[x]` is empty, `s` is False, stdin contains no input.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `lst` is a dictionary with default value of empty list where `lst[a]` contains `b` and `lst[b]` contains `a`, and also `lst[u]` contains `v` and `lst[v]` contains `u`, and so on for all pairs of integers, `lst[x]` is empty, `s` is True, stdin contains no input.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `x` is an integer that was previously in a pair, `y` is an integer that was previously in `lst[x]` and also in `lst[y]`, `lst` is a dictionary with default value of empty list where `lst[a]` contains `b` and `lst[b]` contains `a`, and also `lst[u]` contains `v` and `lst[v]` contains `u`, and so on for all pairs of integers. `x` is equal to `y` and `lst[x]` is empty, `s` is False, stdin contains no input.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
