The only variable in the loop head is variable x, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable x. If x is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, x is an integer between 4 and 200000 inclusive. For the loop to execute again, x must be decreased by 1.
State: **x is an integer between 3 and 199999 inclusive, y is 1, lst is a dictionary with default value of empty list where lst[a] contains b and lst[b] contains a, and also lst[u] contains v and lst[v] contains u, stdin contains n-4 lines each containing two integers u and v, and finally one integer u_1**
