Output State: **`x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `lst` is a dictionary with default value of empty list where `lst[a]` contains `b` and `lst[b]` contains `a`, and also `lst[u]` contains `v` and `lst[v]` contains `u`, and so on for all pairs of integers, `lst[x]` is empty, `s` is True, stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged as integers. The dictionary `lst` still contains the same pairs of integers as before, with `lst[x]` being empty. The only change is that the value of `s` has been toggled from False to True. The stdin remains empty.
