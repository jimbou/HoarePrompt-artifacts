Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, constructs an undirected graph from the input, and then traverses the graph in a specific manner, ultimately printing 'Hermione' or 'Ron' to the console based on the final state of the traversal. The function does not return any value, and its primary purpose is to determine and print the result of the graph traversal.**
