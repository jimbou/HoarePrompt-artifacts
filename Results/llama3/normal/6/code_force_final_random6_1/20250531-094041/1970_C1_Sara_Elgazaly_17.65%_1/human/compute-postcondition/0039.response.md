Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `lst` is a dictionary with default value of empty list where `lst[a]` contains `b` and `lst[b]` contains `a`, and also `lst[u]` contains `v` and `lst[v]` contains `u`, and so on for all pairs of integers in stdin. If `lst[y]` is not empty, then `x` is an integer that was associated with `y`, `y` is an integer that was associated with `x` and is one of the elements of `lst[y]`, `lst[y]` is not empty and contains `x`, `s` is False, stdin contains no input. Otherwise, `x` is an integer that was associated with 1, `y` is an integer that was associated with `x` and is one of the elements of `lst[x]`, `lst[x]` had more than one element and is not empty, `s` is False, stdin contains no input, and `y` is removed from `lst[x]`.***
