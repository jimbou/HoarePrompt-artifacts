Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `x` is an integer that was associated with 1, `y` is an integer that was associated with `x` and is one of the elements of `lst[x]`, `lst` is a dictionary with default value of empty list where `lst[a]` contains `b` and `lst[b]` contains `a`, and also `lst[u]` contains `v` and `lst[v]` contains `u`, and so on for all pairs of integers in stdin, `lst[x]` is not empty and contains `y`, `s` is False, stdin contains no input.
Code of the loop:
while lst[x]:
    y = lst[x].pop()
    if lst[y] != []:
        x = y
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `x` is an integer that was associated with 1, `y` is an integer that was associated with `x` and is one of the elements of `lst[x]`, `lst` is a dictionary with default value of empty list where `lst[a]` contains `b` and `lst[b]` contains `a`, and also `lst[u]` contains `v` and `lst[v]` contains `u`, and so on for all pairs of integers in stdin, `lst[x]` is not empty and contains `y`, `s` is False, stdin contains no input, and `y` is removed from `lst[x]`. If `lst[y]` is not empty, then `x` is an integer that was associated with `y`, `y` is an integer that was associated with `x` and is one of the elements of `lst[y]`, `lst` is a dictionary with default value of empty list where `lst[a]` contains `b` and `lst[b]` contains `a`, and also `lst[u]` contains `v` and `lst[v]` contains `u`, and so on for all pairs of integers in stdin, `lst[y]` is not empty and contains `x`, `s` is False, stdin contains no input.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`x` is an integer that was associated with 1, `y` is an integer that was associated with `x` and is one of the elements of `lst[x]`, `lst` is a dictionary with default value of empty list where `lst[a]` contains `b` and `lst[b]` contains `a`, and also `lst[u]` contains `v` and `lst[v]` contains `u`, and so on for all pairs of integers in stdin, `lst[x]` is not empty, `s` is False, stdin contains no input, and `y` is removed from `lst[x]`. If `lst[y]` is not empty, then `x` is an integer that was associated with `y`, `y` is an integer that was associated with `x` and is one of the elements of `lst[y]`, `lst` is a dictionary with default value of empty list where `lst[a]` contains `b` and `lst[b]` contains `a`, and also `lst[u]` contains `v` and `lst[v]` contains `u`, and so on for all pairs of integers in stdin, `lst[y]` is not empty and contains `x`, `s` is False, stdin contains no input. Otherwise, no changes are made.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `lst` is a dictionary with default value of empty list where `lst[a]` contains `b` and `lst[b]` contains `a`, and also `lst[u]` contains `v` and `lst[v]` contains `u`, and so on for all pairs of integers in stdin. If `lst[y]` is not empty, then `x` is an integer that was associated with `y`, `y` is an integer that was associated with `x` and is one of the elements of `lst[y]`, `lst[y]` is not empty and contains `x`, `s` is False, stdin contains no input. Otherwise, `x` is an integer that was associated with 1, `y` is an integer that was associated with `x` and is one of the elements of `lst[x]`, `lst[x]` had more than one element and is not empty, `s` is False, stdin contains no input, and `y` is removed from `lst[x]`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
