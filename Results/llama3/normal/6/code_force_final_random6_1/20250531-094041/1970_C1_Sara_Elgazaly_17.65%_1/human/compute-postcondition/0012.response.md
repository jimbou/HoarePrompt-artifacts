Postcondition: **`x` is 1, `y` is an integer that was associated with 1, `lst` is a dictionary with default value of empty list where `lst[a]` contains `b` and `lst[b]` contains `a`, and also `lst[u]` contains `v` and `lst[v]` contains `u`, and so on for all pairs of integers in stdin, but `lst[1]` contains at least one integer less than before, `s` is True, stdin contains one integer `u_1` that is associated with 1, and the current value of `lst[y]` is not an empty list.**
