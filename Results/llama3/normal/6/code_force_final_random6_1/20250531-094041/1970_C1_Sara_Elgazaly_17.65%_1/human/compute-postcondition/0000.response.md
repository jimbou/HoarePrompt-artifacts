Output State: **x is an integer between 2 and 200000 inclusive, y is 1, lst is a dictionary with default value of empty list, stdin contains n-1 lines each containing two integers u and v, and finally one integer u_1.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

After executing the code, the variable `x` holds an integer value between 2 and 200000 (inclusive), and the variable `y` holds the value 1. The `lst` variable is a dictionary with a default value of an empty list. The stdin still contains the remaining inputs: `n-1` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and finally one integer `u_1`. The values of `x` and `y` are assigned from the first two integers in the stdin, and the `lst` dictionary is initialized with a default value, but no elements are added to it yet.
