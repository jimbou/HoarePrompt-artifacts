Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer that was associated with 1, `y` is an integer that was associated with `x`, `lst` is a dictionary with default value of empty list where `lst[a]` contains `b` and `lst[b]` contains `a`, and also `lst[u]` contains `v` and `lst[v]` contains `u`, and so on for all pairs of integers in stdin, but `lst[x]` is not empty and has one less element, `s` is True, stdin contains no input. If `lst[y]` is not empty, then `x` is an integer that was associated with `y`, `y` is an integer that was associated with `x`, `lst` is a dictionary with default value of empty list where `lst[a]` contains `b` and `lst[b]` contains `a`, and also `lst[u]` contains `v` and `lst[v]` contains `u`, and so on for all pairs of integers in stdin, but `lst[x]` is not empty and has one less element, `s` is True, stdin contains no input. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of `x`, `y`, `lst`, `s`, and stdin.***
