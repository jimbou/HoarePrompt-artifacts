Output State: **`x` is an integer that was previously in a pair, `y` is an integer that was previously in `lst[x]` and also in `lst[y]`, `lst` is a dictionary with default value of empty list where `lst[a]` contains `b` and `lst[b]` contains `a`, and also `lst[u]` contains `v` and `lst[v]` contains `u`, and so on for all pairs of integers. `x` is equal to `y` and `lst[x]` is empty, `s` is True, stdin contains no input.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is such that `x` and `y` are equal and `lst[x]` is empty. This is because the loop continues to execute as long as `lst[x]` is not empty, and in each iteration, an element is removed from `lst[x]`. Once `lst[x]` is empty, the loop terminates. The state of `s` and stdin remains unchanged throughout the execution of the loop.
