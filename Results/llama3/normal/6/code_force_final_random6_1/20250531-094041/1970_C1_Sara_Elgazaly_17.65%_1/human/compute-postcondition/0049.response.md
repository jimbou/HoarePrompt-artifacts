Output State: **`x` is an integer that is in a pair, `y` is an integer that was previously in `lst[x]` and also in `lst[y]`, `lst` is a dictionary with default value of empty list where `lst[a]` contains `b` and `lst[b]` contains `a`, and also `lst[u]` contains `v` and `lst[v]` contains `u`, and so on for all pairs of integers, `lst[x]` is empty, `s` is True, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been updated to the integer that was previously in `lst[x]` and also in `lst[y]`. The dictionary `lst` still contains all pairs of integers, but `lst[x]` is now empty because the integer `y` has been removed from it. The values of `x` and `s` remain unchanged, and there is still no input in stdin.
