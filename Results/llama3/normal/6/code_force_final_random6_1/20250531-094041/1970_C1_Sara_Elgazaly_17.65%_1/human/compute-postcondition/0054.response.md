Output State: **x is an integer that was previously in a pair, y is an integer that was previously in lst[x] and also in lst[y], lst is a dictionary with default value of empty list where lst[a] contains b and lst[b] contains a, and also lst[u] contains v and lst[v] contains u, and so on for all pairs of integers. x is equal to y, stdin contains no input.**

The first line assigns the value of y to x, making x equal to y. The second line is a break statement, which does not affect any variables. The value of y remains unchanged. The dictionary lst and its contents remain unchanged as well. The stdin remains empty.
