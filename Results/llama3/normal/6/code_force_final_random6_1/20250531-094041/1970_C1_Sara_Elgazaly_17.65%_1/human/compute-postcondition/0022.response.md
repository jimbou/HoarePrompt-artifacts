Postcondition: **`x` is an integer that was associated with 1, `y` is an integer that was associated with `x` and is one of the elements of `lst[x]`, `lst` is a dictionary with default value of empty list where `lst[a]` contains `b` and `lst[b]` contains `a`, and also `lst[u]` contains `v` and `lst[v]` contains `u`, and so on for all pairs of integers in stdin, but `lst[x]` is not empty and has at least 1 element, `s` is True, stdin contains no input. If `lst[y]` is not empty, then `x` is an integer that was associated with `y`, `y` is an integer that was associated with `x` and is one of the elements of `lst[y]`, `lst` is a dictionary with default value of empty list where `lst[a]` contains `b` and `lst[b]` contains `a`, and also `lst[u]` contains `v` and `lst[v]` contains `u`, and so on for all pairs of integers in stdin, but `lst[y]` is not empty and has at least 1 element, `s` is True, stdin contains no input. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.**
