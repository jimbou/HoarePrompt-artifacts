Output State: **`x` is 1, `y` is 1, `lst` is a dictionary with default value of empty list where `lst[a]` contains `b` and `lst[b]` contains `a`, and also `lst[u]` contains `v` and `lst[v]` contains `u`, and also `lst[a]` contains `b` and `lst[b]` contains `a`, and so on for all pairs of integers in stdin, `s` is True, stdin contains one integer `u_1`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `s` that is assigned the value `True`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `lst` remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains one integer `u_1`.
