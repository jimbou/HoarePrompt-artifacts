Output State: **`n` is a list of two non-negative integers. The sum of the elements in `n` is not equal to 0, `position` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The sum of the elements in `n` is still not equal to 0. A new variable `position` is introduced and assigned the value 0.
