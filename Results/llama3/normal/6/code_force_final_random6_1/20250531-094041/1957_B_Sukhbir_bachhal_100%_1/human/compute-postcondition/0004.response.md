The only variable in the loop head is variable `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` is a list of two non-negative integers and the sum of the elements in `n` is not equal to 0. This ensures that `n` is not equal to 0, so no adjustment is needed.

State: **`n` is a list of two non-negative integers, the sum of the elements in `n` is not equal to 0, `position` is 0**
