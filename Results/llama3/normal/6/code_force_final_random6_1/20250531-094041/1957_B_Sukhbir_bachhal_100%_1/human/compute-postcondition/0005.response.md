Output State: **n is a list of two non-negative integers, the sum of the elements in n is not equal to 0, the first element of n is halved, position is 1**

The first line of the code, `n >>= 1`, performs a bitwise right shift operation on the first element of the list `n`. This operation effectively halves the value of the first element. The second line, `position += 1`, increments the value of `position` by 1.

After executing the entire code block, the state of the variables is as follows: `n` remains a list of two non-negative integers, but the first element has been halved due to the bitwise right shift operation. The sum of the elements in `n` is still not equal to 0, as the second element remains unchanged. The value of `position` has been incremented by 1, making it equal to 1.
