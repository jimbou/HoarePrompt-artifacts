Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when n is 1 and k is a power of 2. In this case, the function func_1(k) will return the position of the most significant bit in the binary representation of k, which is a power of 2. However, the program will then try to append 2 ** counter - 1 to the array, which will be equal to k - 1, and then append k - (k - 1) = 1 to the array. This will result in an array with two elements, [k - 1, 1], which does not satisfy the condition that the sum of the elements in the array should be equal to k.

For example, if n is 1 and k is 8, the program will output [7, 1], which does not satisfy the condition that the sum of the elements in the array should be equal to 8. The correct output should be [8].
