The variable in the loop head is n, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable n. If n is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is a list of two non-negative integers, the sum of the elements in n is not equal to 0, the first element of n is halved. Since n is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n is a list of two non-negative integers, the sum of the elements in n is not equal to 0, the first element of n is halved, position is 1**
