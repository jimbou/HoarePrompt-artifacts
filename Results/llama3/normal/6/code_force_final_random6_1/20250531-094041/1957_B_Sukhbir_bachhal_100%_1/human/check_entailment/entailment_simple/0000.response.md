Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of constructing a sequence of n non-negative integers that sum up to k, such that the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence is maximized.

The program uses a helper function `func_1(k)` that calculates the number of times the most significant bit of k needs to be shifted to the right until it becomes 0. This is equivalent to finding the position of the most significant bit in the binary representation of k.

The main program then uses this value to construct the sequence. If n is greater than 1, it appends the value `2 ** counter - 1` to the sequence, which is the maximum value that can be obtained by setting all bits to the right of the most significant bit to 1. It then appends the remaining value `k - arr[-1]` to the sequence, and fills the rest of the sequence with zeros.

If n is 1, the program simply prints k.

The program's logic is correct, and it produces the desired output for the given examples. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
