The only variable in the loop head is variable n, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable n.  If n is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is a list of two non-negative integers, where the first element is halved, position is 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time the first element of n needed to have been greater than 0 and n currently must not be equal to 0.
State: **n is a list of two non-negative integers, where the first element is halved, position is 2 and n currently must not be equal to 0**
