The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line, `n >>= 1`, performs a bitwise right shift operation on the list `n`. Since `n` is a list of two non-negative integers, this operation will effectively halve the value of the first element of `n`. The second line, `position += 1`, increments the value of `position` by 1.

After executing the entire code block, the final state of the variables is as follows:

* `n` is a list of two non-negative integers, where the first element has been halved.
* `position` is 2.

Note that the sum of the elements in `n` is still not equal to 0, as the bitwise right shift operation only affects the first element of the list.

Output State: **n is a list of two non-negative integers, where the first element is halved, position is 2**
