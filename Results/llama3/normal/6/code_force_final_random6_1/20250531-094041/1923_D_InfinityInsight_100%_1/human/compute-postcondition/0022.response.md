Output State: **a is a list of positive integers, n is a positive integer equal to the length of list a, left is a list containing n+1 elements, last is a list of n elements, ans is a list of n elements all initialized to -1, i is the last element in list a.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the list `left` will contain `n+1` elements, where `n` is the length of the list `a`. The first element of `left` is 0, and each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element and the corresponding element in `a`. The variable `i` will be the last element in the list `a`. The other variables, `a`, `n`, `last`, and `ans`, remain unchanged.
