To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2.

To execute the loop again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `i` is now 3, `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`a` is a list of positive integers, `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of list `a` and `n` is greater than 3, `left` is a list containing a single element 0, `last` is a list containing three elements (the exact values depend on the previous iteration's conditions), `ans` is a list of `n` elements all initialized to -1, `i` is 3**
