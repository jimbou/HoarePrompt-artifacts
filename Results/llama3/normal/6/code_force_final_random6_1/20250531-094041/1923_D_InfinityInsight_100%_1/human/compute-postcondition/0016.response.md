To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `i` and the list `a`. 

For the loop to execute, `a` must have at least one element. Since `n` is the length of list `a` and is a positive integer, we can infer that `a` indeed has at least one element. However, we need to adjust the state of `i` to reflect that it will take on the value of the first element in `a` at the start of the loop.

State: **`a` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 1 element, `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of list `a`, `left` is a list containing a single element 0, `last` is a list of `n` elements, `ans` is a list of `n` elements all initialized to -1, `i` is the first element in list `a`**
