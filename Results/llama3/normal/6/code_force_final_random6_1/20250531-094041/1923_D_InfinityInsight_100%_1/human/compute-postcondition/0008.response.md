Output State: **a is a list of positive integers, n is a positive integer equal to the length of list a and n is greater than 2, left is a list containing a single element 0, last is a list containing three elements 0, 1 and 2 if a[i] != a[i - 1], otherwise last is a list containing three elements -1, -1 and 2, ans is a list of n elements all initialized to -1, i is 2**

In this output state, the list `last` has been updated to include the value of `i`, which is 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition `a[i] != a[i - 1]` still determines the values of the last two elements of the `last` list.
