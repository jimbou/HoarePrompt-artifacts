Output State: **`a` is a list of positive integers, `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of list `a` and `n` is greater than 1, `left` is a list containing a single element 0, `last` is a list containing two elements 0 and 1, `ans` is a list of `n` elements all initialized to -1, `i` is 1. The current value of `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1]`.**

In this output state, the list `last` has been updated to include the value of `i`, which is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `last` now contains two elements: the initial value -1 and the newly appended value 1. The rest of the variables maintain their initial values and properties.
