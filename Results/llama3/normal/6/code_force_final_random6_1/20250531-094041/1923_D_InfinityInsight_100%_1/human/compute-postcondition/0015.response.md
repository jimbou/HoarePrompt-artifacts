Output State: **a is a list of positive integers, n is a positive integer equal to the length of list a, left is a list containing a single element 0, last is a list of n elements, ans is a list of n elements all initialized to -1, i is n.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows:

*   The list `a` remains unchanged, containing positive integers.
*   The variable `n` remains the same, representing the length of list `a`.
*   The list `left` still contains a single element, which is 0.
*   The list `last` now has `n` elements, where each element is either the index of the current element in `a` if it is different from the previous element, or the last index where a different element was found.
*   The list `ans` remains unchanged, with all elements initialized to -1.
*   The variable `i` is now equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations.
