Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of positive integers, `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of list `a` and must be at least 3, `left` is a list containing `n+1` elements, `last` is a list of `n` elements, `ans` is a list of `n` elements, `x` is equal to `left[i] - a[i] - 1`, `inx` is equal to `func_1(left, x)`, `inx2` is equal to `last[i - 1]`. If `inx` is less than 0, the function skips to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
