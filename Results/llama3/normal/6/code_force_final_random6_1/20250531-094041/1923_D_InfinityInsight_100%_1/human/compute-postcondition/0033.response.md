Postcondition: ***a is a list of positive integers, n is a positive integer equal to the length of list a and must be at least 2, left is a list containing n+1 elements, last is a list of n elements, ans is a list of n elements with ans[i] equal to 1 if a[i] is less than a[i - 1], otherwise all elements of ans are equal to -1, i is 1, x is equal to left[1] - a[1] - 1. If the current value of inx is less than 0, then the rest of the code in the current loop iteration is skipped and the program moves to the next iteration. Otherwise, the program continues to execute the rest of the code in the current loop iteration.***
