Output State: **`a` is a list of positive integers, `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of list `a` and `n` is greater than 1, `left` is a list containing a single element 0, `last` is a list containing two elements -1 and -1, `ans` is a list of `n` elements all initialized to -1, `i` is 1, and the element at index `i` in list `a` is equal to the element at index `i-1` in list `a`.**

In this output state, the only change is in the `last` list, which now contains two elements, both of which are -1. The other variables remain unchanged.
