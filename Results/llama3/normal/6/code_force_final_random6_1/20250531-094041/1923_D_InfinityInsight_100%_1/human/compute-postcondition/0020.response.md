The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and list `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `a` has at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in list `a`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the `i` is the third element in the list.
State: **`a` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 3 elements, `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of list `a`, `left` is a list containing three elements 0, `i`, and `i` + `i`, `last` is a list of `n` elements, `ans` is a list of `n` elements all initialized to -1, `i` is the third element in list `a`.**
