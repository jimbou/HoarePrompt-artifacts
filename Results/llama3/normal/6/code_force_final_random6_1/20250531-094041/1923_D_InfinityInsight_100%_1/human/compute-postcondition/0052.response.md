Output State: **`a` is a list of positive integers, `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of list `a` and must be at least 3, `left` is a list containing `n+1` elements, `last` is a list of `n` elements, `ans` is a list of `n` elements where `ans[i]` is equal to `i + 1 - inx`, `x` is equal to `left[n] - a[n] - 1`, `inx` is equal to `func_1(left, x)`, `inx2` is equal to `last[n - 1]`, and `i` is equal to `n`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans[i]` has been updated to `i + 1 - inx`, where `inx` is the result of the function `func_1(left, x)`. The other variables remain unchanged. The program continues to the next statement, as the condition `inx < 0` is not met.
