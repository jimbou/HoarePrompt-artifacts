Postcondition: ***a is a list of positive integers, n is a positive integer equal to the length of list a and n is greater than 2, left is a list containing a single element 0, last is a list containing three elements, ans is a list of n elements all initialized to -1, i is 2. If a[i] != a[i - 1], last is a list containing three elements 0, 1 and 2, otherwise last is a list containing three elements -1, -1 and 2 if a[i] == a[i - 1] and a[i - 1] != a[i - 2], otherwise last is a list containing three elements -1, -1 and -1.***
