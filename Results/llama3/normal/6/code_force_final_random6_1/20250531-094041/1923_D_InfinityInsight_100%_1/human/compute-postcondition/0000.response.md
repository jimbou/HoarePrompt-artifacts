Output State: **a is a list of positive integers, n is a positive integer equal to the length of list a, left is a list containing a single element 0, last is a list containing a single element -1, ans is a list of n elements all initialized to -1.**

In this output state, the initial values of `a` and `n` remain unchanged as they were not modified by the code. The code introduced three new variables: `left`, `last`, and `ans`. The `left` list contains a single element, 0. The `last` list contains a single element, -1. The `ans` list is initialized with `n` elements, all set to -1.
