Output State: **`a` is a list of positive integers, `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of list `a` and must be at least 3, `left` is a list containing `n+1` elements, `last` is a list of `n` elements, `ans` is a list of `n` elements where if `a[i]` is less than `a[i - 1]`, then `ans[i]` is equal to 1. Otherwise, `ans[i]` is equal to `i + 1 - func_1(left, left[i] - a[i] - 1)`, `x` is equal to `left[n] - a[n] - 1`, `inx` is equal to `func_1(left, x)`, `inx2` is equal to `last[n - 1]`, and `i` is equal to `n`. The program skips the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that the program skips the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. The values of the variables remain unchanged.
