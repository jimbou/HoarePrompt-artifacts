Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when a slime can be eaten by another slime from the right side. The current implementation only checks if a slime can be eaten by a larger slime from the left side.

For example, consider the input [3, 2, 4, 2]. The program will output [2, 1, 2, 1], but the correct output should be [1, 1, 1, 1] because the 3rd slime can eat the 2nd slime from the right side.

To fix this issue, the program should also check if a slime can be eaten by a larger slime from the right side, and update the answer accordingly.
