To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `i` is now 2, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`a` is a list of positive integers, `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of list `a` and must be at least 3, `left` is a list containing `n+1` elements, `last` is a list of `n` elements, `ans` is a list of `n` elements with `ans[i]` equal to `i + 1 - x` if `x` is not less than 0, otherwise `ans[i]` is equal to 1 if `a[i]` is less than `a[i - 1]`, otherwise all elements of `ans` are equal to -1, `i` is 2, `x` is equal to `left[2] - a[2] - 1**
