Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is a list of positive integers, n is a positive integer equal to the length of list a, left is a list containing n+1 elements, last is a list of n elements, ans is a list of n elements all initialized to -1, i is the last element in list a.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i] < a[i - 1]:
        ans[i] = 1
        continue
    x = left[i] - a[i] - 1
    inx = func_1(left, x)
    inx2 = last[i - 1]
    if inx2 < inx:
        inx = inx2
    if inx < 0:
        continue
    ans[i] = i + 1 - inx


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list of positive integers, `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of list `a` and must be at least 2, `left` is a list containing `n+1` elements, `last` is a list of `n` elements, `ans` is a list of `n` elements with `ans[i]` equal to `i + 1 - x` if `x` is not less than 0, otherwise `ans[i]` is equal to 1 if `a[i]` is less than `a[i - 1]`, otherwise all elements of `ans` are equal to -1, `i` is 1, `x` is equal to `left[1] - a[1] - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list of positive integers, `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of list `a` and must be at least 3, `left` is a list containing `n+1` elements, `last` is a list of `n` elements, `ans` is a list of `n` elements where `ans[i]` is equal to `i + 1 - func_1(left, left[i] - a[i] - 1)`, `x` is equal to `left[i] - a[i] - 1`, `inx` is equal to `func_1(left, x)`, `inx2` is equal to `last[i - 1]`. If `inx` is less than 0, the function skips to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of positive integers, `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of list `a` and must be at least 3, `left` is a list containing `n+1` elements, `last` is a list of `n` elements, `ans` is a list of `n` elements where `ans[i]` is equal to `i + 1 - inx`, `x` is equal to `left[n] - a[n] - 1`, `inx` is equal to `func_1(left, x)`, `inx2` is equal to `last[n - 1]`, and `i` is equal to `n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
