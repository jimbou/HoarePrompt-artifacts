Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of positive integers, `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of list `a` and must be at least 3, `left` is a list containing `n+1` elements, `last` is a list of `n` elements, `ans` is a list of `n` elements. If `a[2]` is less than `a[1]`, then `ans[2]` is equal to 1. Otherwise, `ans[i]` is equal to `i + 1 - x` if `x` is not less than 0, otherwise `ans[i]` is equal to 1 if `a[i]` is less than `a[i - 1]`, otherwise all elements of `ans` are equal to -1, where `x` is equal to `left[2] - a[2] - 1` and `i` is 2.***
