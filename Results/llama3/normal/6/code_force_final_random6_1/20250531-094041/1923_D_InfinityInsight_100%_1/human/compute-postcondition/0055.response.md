Functionality: **This function takes a list of positive integers 'a' and its length 'n' as input, and returns a list 'ans' of the same length 'n'. The function compares each element in the list 'a' with its previous element, and for each comparison, it calculates a value based on the difference between the current element and the previous element. If the current element is less than the previous element, the function sets the corresponding value in the output list 'ans' to 1. Otherwise, it calculates the value using the function 'func_1' and assigns it to the corresponding position in the output list 'ans'. The function returns the list 'ans' containing the results of these comparisons and calculations.**
