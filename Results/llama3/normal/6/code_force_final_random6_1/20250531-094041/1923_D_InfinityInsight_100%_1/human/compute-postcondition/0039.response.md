Output State: **`a` is a list of positive integers, `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of list `a` and must be at least 3, `left` is a list containing `n+1` elements, `last` is a list of `n` elements, `ans` is a list of `n` elements, `x` is equal to `left[i] - a[i] - 1`, `inx` is equal to `last[i - 1]`, `inx2` is equal to `last[i - 1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `a` remains unchanged as a list of positive integers. The value of `n` remains the same, equal to the length of list `a` and at least 3. The lists `left`, `last`, and `ans` also remain unchanged. The value of `x` is still equal to the expression `left[i] - a[i] - 1`. However, the value of `inx` has been updated to be equal to `last[i - 1]`, which is the same value as `inx2`.
