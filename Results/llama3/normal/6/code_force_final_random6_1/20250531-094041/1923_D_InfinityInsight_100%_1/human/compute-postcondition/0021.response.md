Output State: **`a` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 3 elements, `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of list `a`, `left` is a list containing four elements 0, `i`, `i` + `i`, and `i` + `i` + `i`, `last` is a list of `n` elements, `ans` is a list of `n` elements all initialized to -1, `i` is the third element in list `a`.**

In this output state, the list `left` has been updated by appending the sum of its last element and `i`, which is the third element in list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
