The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n - 1` and `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be equal to `n` and `n` must be at least 3.
State: **`a` is a list of positive integers, `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of list `a` and must be at least 3, `left` is a list containing `n+1` elements, `last` is a list of `n` elements, `ans` is a list of `n` elements where `ans[i]` is equal to `i + 1 - func_1(left, left[i] - a[i] - 1)`, `x` is equal to `left[i] - a[i] - 1`, `inx` is equal to `func_1(left, x)`, `inx2` is equal to `last[i - 1]`, `i` is equal to `n`**
