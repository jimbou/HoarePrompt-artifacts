To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 2 (since the range starts from 1 and goes up to but not including `n`). 

State: **`a` is a list of positive integers, `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of list `a` and must be at least 2, `left` is a list containing `n+1` elements, `last` is a list of `n` elements, `ans` is a list of `n` elements all initialized to -1, `i` is 1**
