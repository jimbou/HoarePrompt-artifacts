The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **a is a list of positive integers, n is a positive integer equal to the length of list a and n is greater than 2, left is a list containing a single element 0, last is a list containing two elements 0 and 1 if a[i] != a[i - 1], otherwise last is a list containing two elements -1 and -1, ans is a list of n elements all initialized to -1, i is 2**
