Output State: **a is a list of positive integers, n is a positive integer equal to the length of list a and must be at least 2, left is a list containing n+1 elements, last is a list of n elements, ans is a list of n elements with ans[i] equal to 1 if a[i] is less than a[i - 1], otherwise all elements of ans are equal to -1, i is 1, x is equal to left[1] - a[1] - 1, inx is equal to last[0], and inx2 is equal to last[0].**

The value of inx is updated to be equal to inx2, which is equal to last[0]. The values of the other variables are not affected.
