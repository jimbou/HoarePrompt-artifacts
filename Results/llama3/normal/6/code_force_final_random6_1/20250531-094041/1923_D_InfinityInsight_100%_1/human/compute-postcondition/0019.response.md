Output State: **`a` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 2 elements, `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of list `a`, `left` is a list containing three elements 0, `i`, and `i` + `i`, `last` is a list of `n` elements, `ans` is a list of `n` elements all initialized to -1, `i` is the second element in list `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `left` has been updated to include a new element, which is the sum of the last element in `left` (which is `i`) and `i` itself. The other variables remain unchanged.
