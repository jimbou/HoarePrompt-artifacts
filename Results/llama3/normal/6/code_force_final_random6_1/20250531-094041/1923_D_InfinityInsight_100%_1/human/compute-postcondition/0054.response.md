Output State: **The program returns the list 'ans' containing the results of the comparison between consecutive elements in list 'a'. Each element 'ans[i]' represents the result of the comparison between 'a[i]' and 'a[i-1]'. If 'a[i]' is less than 'a[i-1]', then 'ans[i]' is set to 1. Otherwise, 'ans[i]' is set to 'i + 1 - inx', where 'inx' is the result of the function 'func_1(left, x)' and 'x' is calculated as 'left[i] - a[i] - 1'. The list 'ans' has a length equal to the length of list 'a', which is 'n'.**
