Output State: **`a` is a list of positive integers, `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of list `a` and must be at least 2, `left` is a list containing `n+1` elements, `last` is a list of `n` elements, `ans` is a list of `n` elements with `ans[i]` equal to `i + 1 - x` if `x` is not less than 0, otherwise `ans[i]` is equal to 1 if `a[i]` is less than `a[i - 1]`, otherwise all elements of `ans` are equal to -1, `i` is 1, `x` is equal to `left[1] - a[1] - 1`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans[i]` has been updated based on the value of `x`. If `x` is not less than 0, `ans[i]` is now equal to `i + 1 - x`, otherwise its value remains the same as before. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
