Output State: **`a` is a list of positive integers, `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of list `a` and must be at least 3, `left` is a list containing `n+1` elements, `last` is a list of `n` elements, `ans` is a list of `n` elements, `x` is equal to `left[i] - a[i] - 1`, `inx` is equal to `func_1(left, x)`, `inx2` is equal to `last[i - 1]`. The execution skips to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with no changes to the values of the variables. The only effect of the `continue` statement is to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration.
