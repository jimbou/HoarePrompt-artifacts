Output State: **`a` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 1 element, `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of list `a`, `left` is a list containing two elements 0 and `i`, `last` is a list of `n` elements, `ans` is a list of `n` elements all initialized to -1, `i` is the first element in list `a`**

In this output state, the value of `left` has been updated to include a new element, which is the sum of the last element in `left` (which is 0) and the value of `i` (which is the first element in list `a`). The other variables remain unchanged.
