Output State: **a is a list of positive integers, n is a positive integer equal to the length of list a and must be at least 2, left is a list containing n+1 elements, last is a list of n elements, ans is a list of n elements with ans[i] equal to 1 if a[i] is less than a[i - 1], otherwise all elements of ans are equal to -1, i is 1, x is equal to left[1] - a[1] - 1, and the current value of inx is less than 0, and we skip the rest of the code in the current loop iteration and move to the next iteration.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip the rest of the code in the current loop iteration and move to the next iteration due to the "continue" statement.
