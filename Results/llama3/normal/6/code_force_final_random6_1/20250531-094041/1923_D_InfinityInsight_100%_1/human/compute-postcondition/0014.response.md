Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of positive integers, `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of list `a` and `n` is greater than 3, `left` is a list containing a single element 0, `last` is a list containing four elements, `ans` is a list of `n` elements all initialized to -1, `i` is 3. If `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1]`, `last` contains four elements. Otherwise, the first three elements of `last` depend on the previous iteration's conditions and the fourth element is equal to the third element.***
