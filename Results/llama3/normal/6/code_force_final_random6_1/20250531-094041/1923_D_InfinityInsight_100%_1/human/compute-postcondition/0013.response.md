Output State: **`a` is a list of positive integers, `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of list `a` and `n` is greater than 3, `left` is a list containing a single element 0, `last` is a list containing four elements (the first three elements depend on the previous iteration's conditions and the fourth element is equal to the third element), `ans` is a list of `n` elements all initialized to -1, `i` is 3**

In this output state, the value of `last` has been updated to include a new element, which is equal to the last element of the previous `last` list. The other variables remain unchanged.
