To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in a:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `i` and `a`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `a` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 1 element, and `i` is the first element in list `a`.

For the loop to execute again, `a` must have at least one more element, and `i` must be the next element in the list.

So, we can adjust the states as follows:

* `a` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 2 elements.
* `i` is the second element in list `a`.

The other variables (`n`, `left`, `last`, and `ans`) are not involved in the loop head, so their states remain unchanged.

State: **`a` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 2 elements, `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of list `a`, `left` is a list containing two elements 0 and `i`, `last` is a list of `n` elements, `ans` is a list of `n` elements all initialized to -1, `i` is the second element in list `a`**
