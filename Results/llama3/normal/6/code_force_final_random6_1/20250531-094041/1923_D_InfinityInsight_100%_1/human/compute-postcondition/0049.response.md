Postcondition: ***a is a list of positive integers, n is a positive integer equal to the length of list a and must be at least 3, left is a list containing n+1 elements, last is a list of n elements, ans is a list of n elements where if a[i] is less than a[i - 1], then ans[i] is equal to 1. Otherwise, ans[i] is equal to i + 1 - func_1(left, left[i] - a[i] - 1), x is equal to left[n] - a[n] - 1, inx is equal to func_1(left, x), inx2 is equal to last[n - 1], and i is equal to n. If inx2 is less than inx, then the program executes the if part. Otherwise, the program does not execute the if part.***
