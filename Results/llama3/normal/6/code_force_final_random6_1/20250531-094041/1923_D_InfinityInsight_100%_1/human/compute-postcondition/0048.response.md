Output State: **`a` is a list of positive integers, `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of list `a` and must be at least 3, `left` is a list containing `n+1` elements, `last` is a list of `n` elements, `ans` is a list of `n` elements where if `a[i]` is less than `a[i - 1]`, then `ans[i]` is equal to 1. Otherwise, `ans[i]` is equal to `i + 1 - func_1(left, left[i] - a[i] - 1)`, `x` is equal to `left[n] - a[n] - 1`, `inx` is equal to `last[n - 1]`, and `i` is equal to `n`.**

In this output state, the value of `inx` has been updated to be equal to `inx2`, which is `last[n - 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
