Postcondition: ***a is a list of positive integers, n is a positive integer equal to the length of list a and must be at least 2, left is a list containing n+1 elements, last is a list of n elements, ans is a list of n elements with ans[i] equal to 1 if a[i] is less than a[i - 1], otherwise all elements of ans are equal to -1, i is 1, x is equal to left[1] - a[1] - 1. If last[0] is less than last[0], then inx is equal to last[0], otherwise inx remains unchanged.***
