Output State: **a is a list of positive integers, n is a positive integer equal to the length of list a and must be at least 2, left is a list containing n+1 elements, last is a list of n elements, ans is a list of n elements with ans[i] equal to 1 and all other elements equal to -1, i is 1.**

The code snippet assigns 1 to the ith element of the list ans and then skips to the next iteration of the loop using the continue statement. This means that only the ith element of ans is modified, and all other variables remain unchanged. The value of i remains 1, and the condition that the current value of a[i] is less than the current value of a[i - 1] still holds true.
