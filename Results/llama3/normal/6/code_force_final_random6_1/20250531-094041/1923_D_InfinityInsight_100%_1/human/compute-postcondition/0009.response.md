Output State: **a is a list of positive integers, n is a positive integer equal to the length of list a and n is greater than 2, left is a list containing a single element 0, last is a list containing three elements 0, 1 and 1 if a[i] != a[i - 1], otherwise last is a list containing three elements -1, -1 and -1, ans is a list of n elements all initialized to -1, i is 2**

In this output state, the list `last` has been updated to contain three elements. If the current element in the list `a` is not equal to the previous element, then `last` contains the elements 0, 1, and 1. Otherwise, it contains the elements -1, -1, and -1. The other variables remain unchanged.
