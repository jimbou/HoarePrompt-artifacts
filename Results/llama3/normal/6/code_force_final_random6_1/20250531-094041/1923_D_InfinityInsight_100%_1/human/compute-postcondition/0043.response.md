Output State: **`a` is a list of positive integers, `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of list `a` and must be at least 3, `left` is a list containing `n+1` elements, `last` is a list of `n` elements, `ans` is a list of `n` elements where `ans[i]` is equal to `i + 1 - func_1(left, left[i] - a[i] - 1)`, `x` is equal to `left[i] - a[i] - 1`, `inx` is equal to `func_1(left, x)`, `inx2` is equal to `last[i - 1]`. If `inx` is less than 0, the function skips to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no action is taken.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `a` remains unchanged, the length of `a` is still `n` and is at least 3, the lists `left` and `last` also remain unchanged. The list `ans` has been updated at index `i` to be equal to `i + 1` minus the result of the function `func_1` called with arguments `left` and `x`, where `x` is equal to `left[i] - a[i] - 1`. The values of `x`, `inx`, and `inx2` are still the same. If `inx` is less than 0, the function will skip to the next iteration of the loop, otherwise, no action is taken.
