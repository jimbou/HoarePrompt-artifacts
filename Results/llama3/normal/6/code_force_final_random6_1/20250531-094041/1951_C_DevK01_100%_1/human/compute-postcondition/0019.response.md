Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 1, n is q, N is a list of q smallest integers from the sorted list M, q is the smallest integer greater than or equal to k/m, m is the minimum of the original m and k, M is a sorted list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If n * m equals k, then cost is m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2). Otherwise, n is q - 1, N is a list of q - 1 smallest integers from the sorted list M, w is the largest integer from the original N, mu is k - (n - 1) * m, and cost is mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu, and cost is printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but we skip to the next iteration of the loop, effectively ignoring the current iteration. The values of all variables remain the same, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two. The cost is still calculated and printed based on the conditions, but we move on to the next iteration without executing any further code in the current iteration.
