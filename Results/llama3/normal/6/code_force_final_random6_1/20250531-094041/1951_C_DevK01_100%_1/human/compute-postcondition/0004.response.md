Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is the length of the list `N`, `N` is a list of `q` smallest integers from the sorted list `M`, `q` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `k/m`, `m` is the minimum of the original `m` and `k`, `M` is a sorted list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and the product of `n` and `m` is equal to `k`.**

In this output state, the value of `cost` is calculated based on the given variables `m`, `N`, and `n`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one. The product of `n` and `m` is still equal to `k`.
