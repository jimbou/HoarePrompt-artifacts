Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 2, n is the length of N, N is a list of q smallest integers from the sorted list M, q is the smallest integer greater than or equal to k/m, m is the minimum of the original m and k, M is a sorted list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, L is a list of three integers, k is an integer. If n * m equals k, then cost is m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2). Otherwise, n is the length of N minus one, w is the largest integer in N, mu is k minus (n - 1) times m, and cost is mu times w plus m times the sum of N plus m squared times the sum of integers from 1 to n-1 plus n times m times mu.***
