Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases t and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the three integers n, m, and k, and the list of prices M.
3. It sorts the prices in ascending order, which is correct because we want to buy tickets on the days with the lowest prices first.
4. It calculates the minimum number of days q needed to buy k tickets, which is the ceiling of k/m.
5. It creates a new list N containing the prices for the first q days.
6. If the total number of tickets that can be bought on these q days is equal to k, it calculates the cost as the sum of the prices multiplied by m, plus the additional cost due to the price increase.
7. If the total number of tickets that can be bought on these q days is less than k, it calculates the cost as the cost of buying the remaining tickets on the last day, plus the cost of buying the tickets on the previous days, plus the additional cost due to the price increase.
8. Finally, it prints the calculated cost.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when k is a multiple of m, and when k is not a multiple of m. It also correctly calculates the additional cost due to the price increase.

Correctness: **True**
