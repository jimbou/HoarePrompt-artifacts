Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 1, n is q - 1, N is a list of q - 1 smallest integers from the sorted list M, q is the smallest integer greater than or equal to k/m, m is the minimum of the original m and k, M is a sorted list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, w is the largest integer from the original N, mu is k - (n - 1) * m, cost is mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu**
