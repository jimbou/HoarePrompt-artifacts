Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum spending to purchase k tickets, considering the constraints of the concert organizers.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases (t) and iterating over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the number of sale days (n), the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day (m), and the number of tickets to be bought (k). It then reads the prices per ticket for each of the upcoming n days (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n).

3. The program sorts the prices in ascending order and calculates the minimum number of days (q) required to buy k tickets, considering the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day (m).

4. It then calculates the cost of buying tickets for the first (q-1) days, considering the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day (m). The cost is calculated as the sum of the prices of the tickets for the first (q-1) days, plus the additional cost due to the increase in prices for the remaining days.

5. If the total number of tickets bought in the first (q-1) days is less than k, it calculates the cost of buying the remaining tickets on the last day.

6. Finally, it prints the total cost of buying k tickets.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets, considering the constraints of the concert organizers. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
