Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is the length of the list N, N is a list of q smallest integers from the sorted list M, q is the smallest integer greater than or equal to k/m, m is the minimum of the original m and k, M is a sorted list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

Here's a natural language description of the output state:

The value of `t` remains unchanged as a positive integer greater than 0. The value of `_` also remains unchanged as 0. The variable `n` now holds the length of the list `N`, which is a subset of the sorted list `M`. The list `N` contains the `q` smallest integers from `M`, where `q` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `k/m`. The value of `m` has been updated to be the minimum of its original value and `k`. The list `M` is now sorted in ascending order and contains the original `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. The stdin now contains one less test case than before.
