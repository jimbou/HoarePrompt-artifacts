Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is the length of the list N minus one, N is a list of q-1 smallest integers from the sorted list M, q is the smallest integer greater than or equal to k/m, m is the minimum of the original m and k, M is a sorted list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, w is the largest integer removed from N, mu is k - (n - 1) * m, cost is the calculated cost based on mu, w, N, n, and m.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as a positive integer greater than 0. The value of `_` also remains unchanged as 0. The value of `n` is updated to be the length of the list `N` minus one, since one element is removed from `N` in the first line of the code. The list `N` is updated to be a list of `q-1` smallest integers from the sorted list `M`, since one element is removed from `N`. The value of `q` remains unchanged as the smallest integer greater than or equal to `k/m`. The value of `m` remains unchanged as the minimum of the original `m` and `k`. The list `M` remains unchanged as a sorted list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. The stdin remains unchanged as it contains multiple test cases minus one. The value of `w` is updated to be the largest integer removed from `N`. The value of `mu` is calculated as `k - (n - 1) * m`. The value of `cost` is calculated based on `mu`, `w`, `N`, `n`, and `m`.
