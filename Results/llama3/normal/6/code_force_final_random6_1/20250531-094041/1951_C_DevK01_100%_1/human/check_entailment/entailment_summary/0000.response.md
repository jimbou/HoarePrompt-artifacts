Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum spending to purchase k tickets, considering the constraints of the concert organizers. The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of sale days (n), the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day (m), and the number of tickets to be bought (k). It also reads the prices per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

The program then sorts the prices in ascending order and calculates the minimum cost by considering two cases:

1.  If the total number of tickets that can be bought in the first q days (where q is the ceiling of k/m) is equal to k, it calculates the cost by multiplying the sum of the prices of the first q days by m and adding the additional cost due to the increase in prices.
2.  If the total number of tickets that can be bought in the first q days is not equal to k, it calculates the cost by considering the last day separately and adding the cost of buying the remaining tickets in the previous days.

The program prints the calculated minimum cost for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
