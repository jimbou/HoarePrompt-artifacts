Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the number of days `n`, the maximum number of tickets that can be purchased per day `m`, and the total number of tickets to be purchased `k`.

3. It then reads the prices of the tickets for each day `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` and stores them in the list `M`.

4. The program sorts the prices in ascending order. This is because the optimal strategy is to buy the tickets on the days with the lowest prices first.

5. It then calculates the number of days `q` needed to buy `k` tickets, where `q` is the ceiling of `k/m`. This is because we can buy at most `m` tickets per day.

6. The program then calculates the cost of buying the tickets. If `n*m` is equal to `k`, it means we can buy all the tickets on the `n` days with the lowest prices. In this case, the cost is `m` times the sum of the prices of these `n` days, plus `m*m` times the sum of the first `n-1` natural numbers (this is because the price of each ticket increases by `m` for each day after the first day).

7. If `n*m` is not equal to `k`, it means we cannot buy all the tickets on the `n` days with the lowest prices. In this case, we calculate the cost of buying the remaining tickets on the last day, and add it to the cost of buying the tickets on the first `n-1` days.

8. Finally, the program prints the total cost.

The program correctly implements the optimal strategy for buying the tickets, and it handles all the edge cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
