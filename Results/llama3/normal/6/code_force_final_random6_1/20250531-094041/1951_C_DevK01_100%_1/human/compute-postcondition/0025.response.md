Based on the precondition, the code prints the calculated cost. The cost is calculated based on the values of n, m, N, k, and other variables. If n * m equals k, then the cost is m times the sum of N plus m squared times the sum of integers from 1 to n-1. Otherwise, the cost is mu times w plus m times the sum of N plus m squared times the sum of integers from 1 to n-1 plus n times m times mu.

Since the exact values of n, m, N, k, and other variables are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of cost. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated cost.

Output: **cost (where cost is the calculated cost based on the values of n, m, N, k, and other variables)**
