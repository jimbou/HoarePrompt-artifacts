Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when the number of tickets to be bought (k) is not a multiple of the maximum number of tickets that can be bought per day (m). In this case, the program incorrectly calculates the cost of buying the remaining tickets.

For example, if n = 4, m = 2, k = 5, and the prices are [8, 6, 4, 2], the program will calculate the cost as follows:

* Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4].
* Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6].
* Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4. The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3].

However, the correct solution is to buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16, and then buy 3 tickets on the second day with cost 18 (6 + 6 + 6), for a total cost of 34.

The program incorrectly calculates the cost of buying the remaining tickets, which leads to an incorrect result.
