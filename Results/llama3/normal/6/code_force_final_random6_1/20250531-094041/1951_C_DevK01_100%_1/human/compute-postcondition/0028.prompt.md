Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains three integers n, m, and k (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, 1 <= m <= 10^9, 1 <= k <= min(nm, 10^9)). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    L = list(map(int, input().split()))
    M = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n, m, k = L[0], L[1], L[2]
    m = min(m, k)
    M.sort()
    q = int(math.ceil(k / m))
    N = M[:q]
    n = len(N)
    if n * m == k:
        cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)
    else:
        w = N.pop()
        mu = k - (n - 1) * m
        cost = mu * w
        n = len(N)
        cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu
    print(cost)
    continue


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is the length of the list N, N is a list of q smallest integers from the sorted list M, q is the smallest integer greater than or equal to k/m, m is the minimum of the original m and k, M is a sorted list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and we skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 1, n is q, N is a list of q smallest integers from the sorted list M, q is the smallest integer greater than or equal to k/m, m is the minimum of the original m and k, M is a sorted list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If n * m equals k, then cost is m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2). Otherwise, n is q - 1, N is a list of q - 1 smallest integers from the sorted list M, w is the largest integer from the original N, mu is k - (n - 1) * m, and cost is mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu, and cost is printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 2, n is the length of N, N is a list of q smallest integers from the sorted list M, q is the smallest integer greater than or equal to k/m, m is the minimum of the original m and k, M is a sorted list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, L is a list of three integers, k is an integer. If n * m equals k, then cost is m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2). Otherwise, n is the length of N minus one, w is the largest integer in N, mu is k minus (n - 1) times m, and cost is mu times w plus m times the sum of N plus m squared times the sum of integers from 1 to n-1 plus n times m times mu, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
