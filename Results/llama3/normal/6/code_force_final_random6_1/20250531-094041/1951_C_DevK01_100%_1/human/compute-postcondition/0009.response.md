The code prints the calculated cost based on the values of n, m, N, and k.
Since the exact values of n, m, N, and k are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of cost. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated cost.
Output: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is the length of the list N, N is a list of q smallest integers from the sorted list M, q is the smallest integer greater than or equal to k/m, m is the minimum of the original m and k, M is a sorted list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If the product of n and m is equal to k, then the cost is m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2). Otherwise, n is the length of the list N minus one, and the cost is calculated based on mu, w, N, n, and m, where mu is k - (n - 1) * m, and w is the largest integer removed from N., and cost (where cost is the calculated cost based on the values of n, m, N, and k) is printed**
