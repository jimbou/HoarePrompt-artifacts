Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is `q`, `N` is a list of `q` smallest integers from the sorted list `M`, `q` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `k/m`, `m` is the minimum of the original `m` and `k`, `M` is a sorted list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In this output state, the value of `cost` is calculated based on the values of `m`, `N`, and `n`. The other variables remain unchanged. The `cost` is a result of the multiplication of `m` with the sum of the elements in `N` and the multiplication of `m` squared with the sum of the first `n-1` positive integers (i.e., `(n - 1) * n // 2`). The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two.
