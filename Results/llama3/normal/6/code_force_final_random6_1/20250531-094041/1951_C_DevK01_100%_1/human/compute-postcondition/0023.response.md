Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 2, n is the length of N minus one, N is a list of q-1 smallest integers from the sorted list M, q is the smallest integer greater than or equal to k/m, m is the minimum of the original m and k, M is a sorted list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, L is a list of three integers, M is a sorted list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, k is an integer, w is the largest integer in N, mu is k minus (n - 1) times m, cost is mu times w plus m times the sum of N plus m squared times the sum of integers from 1 to n-1 plus n times m times mu.**

The code modifies the values of `n`, `N`, `w`, `mu`, and `cost`. The value of `n` is updated to be the length of `N` minus one, since one element is removed from `N` by the `pop()` operation. The value of `N` is updated to be a list of `q-1` smallest integers from the sorted list `M`, since one element is removed from `N`. The value of `w` is set to the largest integer in `N`, which is the element removed by the `pop()` operation. The value of `mu` is calculated as `k` minus `(n - 1)` times `m`. The value of `cost` is calculated as the sum of `mu` times `w`, `m` times the sum of `N`, `m` squared times the sum of integers from 1 to `n-1`, and `n` times `m` times `mu`.
