Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains three integers n, m, and k (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, 1 <= m <= 10^9, 1 <= k <= min(nm, 10^9)). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).**

In natural language, the output state is: The variable `t` is assigned a positive integer value from the input, which represents the number of test cases. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines. The first line of each test case contains three integers n, m, and k, where n is between 1 and 3 * 10^5, m is between 1 and 10^9, and k is between 1 and the minimum of nm and 10^9. The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where each a_i is between 1 and 10^9.
