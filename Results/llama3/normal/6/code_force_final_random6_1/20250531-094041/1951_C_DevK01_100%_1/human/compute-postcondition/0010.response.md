Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is the length of the list N, N is a list of q smallest integers from the sorted list M, q is the smallest integer greater than or equal to k/m, m is the minimum of the original m and k, M is a sorted list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and we skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, but we skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. The continue statement does not affect the values of any variables, but it changes the control flow of the program by skipping the current iteration and moving to the next one.
