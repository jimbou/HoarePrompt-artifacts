Output State: **`day` is 'AM', `n` is at least 0, `h` is 12, `m` is an integer between 0 and 59, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings, each of length 5, representing valid times in 24-hour format**

The code changes the value of `day` from 'PM' to 'AM'. The other variables and the stdin remain unchanged.
