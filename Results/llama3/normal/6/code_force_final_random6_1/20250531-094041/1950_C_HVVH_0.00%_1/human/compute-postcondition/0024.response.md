Postcondition: ***`day` is either 'PM' or 'AM', `n` is decreased by 1, `h` is an integer between -12 and 23, `m` is an integer between 0 and 59, `_` is increased by 1, stdin contains no input. If `h` is greater than 12, then `day` is 'PM' and `h` is an integer between -12 and 11. If `h` is less than or equal to 12, then `day` is 'AM' if `h` is 12, otherwise `day` remains 'PM'.***
