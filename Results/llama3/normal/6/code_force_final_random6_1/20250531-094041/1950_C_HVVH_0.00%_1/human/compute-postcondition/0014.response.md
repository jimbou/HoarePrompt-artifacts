Postcondition: ***`day`, `n`, `h`, `m`, `_` are as initially described. If `h` is 0, `h` is updated to 12 and `day` remains 'AM'. If `h` is larger than 12, `day` is 'PM' and `h` is an integer between 1 and 11. Otherwise, `day` is 'PM' if `h` is not 12, otherwise `day` is 'AM', and `h` is an integer between 1 and 12.***
