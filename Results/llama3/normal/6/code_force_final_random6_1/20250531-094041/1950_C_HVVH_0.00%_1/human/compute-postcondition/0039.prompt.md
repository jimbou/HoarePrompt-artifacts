Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: day is 'AM', n is a positive integer between 1 and 1440, stdin contains t strings, each of length 5, representing valid times in 24-hour format.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    h, m = map(int, input().split(':'))
    if h == 0:
        h = 12
        day = 'AM'
    elif h > 12:
        h = h - 12
        day = 'PM'
    else:
        day = 'PM'
        if h == 12:
            day = 'AM'
    print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `day`, `n`, `h`, `m`, `_` are as initially described. If `h` is 0, `h` is updated to 12 and `day` remains 'AM'. If `h` is larger than 12, `day` is 'PM' and `h` is an integer between 1 and 11. Otherwise, `day` is 'PM' if `h` is not 12, otherwise `day` is 'AM', and `h` is an integer between 1 and 12, and the time in the format 'hh:mm' where hh is the value of `h` and mm is the value of `m` and the day is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `day` is unchanged, `n` is decreased by 1, `h` is an integer between 0 and 23, `m` is an integer between 0 and 59, `_` is increased by 1, stdin contains no input. If `h` is 0, then `day` is 'AM' and `h` is 12. If `h` is not 0, then `day` is either 'PM' or 'AM', if `h` is greater than 12, then `day` is 'PM' and `h` is an integer between -12 and 11. If `h` is less than or equal to 12, then `day` is 'AM' if `h` is 12, otherwise `day` remains 'PM'. The time in the format 'hh:mm' where hh is the value of `h` and mm is the value of `m`, and the day which is either 'AM' or 'PM' is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `day`, `n`, `h`, `m`, `_` are unchanged. If `h` is 0, then `day` is 'AM' and `h` is 12. Otherwise, if `h` is greater than 12, then `day` is 'PM' and `h` is an integer between -12 and 11. If `h` is less than or equal to 12, then `day` is 'AM' if `h` is 12, otherwise `day` remains 'PM'. However, since stdin contains no input, `h` and `m` will be assigned values from an empty input, which will result in an error. The time in the format 'HH:MM' is printed, where HH is the hour in 24-hour format and MM is the minute, and the day is printed, where day is 'AM' or 'PM'




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
