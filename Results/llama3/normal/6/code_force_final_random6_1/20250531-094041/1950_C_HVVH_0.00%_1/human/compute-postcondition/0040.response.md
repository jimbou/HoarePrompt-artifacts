Functionality: **The function reads a positive integer t from standard input, representing the number of time conversions to perform. It then reads t strings, each representing a time in 24-hour format (hh:mm), and for each time, it converts the hour to 12-hour format and determines whether it is AM or PM. The function prints each converted time in the format hh:mm AM/PM. After processing all input times, the function leaves the day in the state 'AM' and the input count n in the state 0, with no remaining input in standard input.**
