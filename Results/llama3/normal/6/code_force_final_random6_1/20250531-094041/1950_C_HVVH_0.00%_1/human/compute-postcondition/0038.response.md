Output: **`day`, `n`, `h`, `m`, `_` are unchanged. If `h` is 0, then `day` is 'AM' and `h` is 12. Otherwise, if `h` is greater than 12, then `day` is 'PM' and `h` is an integer between -12 and 11. If `h` is less than or equal to 12, then `day` is 'AM' if `h` is 12, otherwise `day` remains 'PM'. However, since stdin contains no input, `h` and `m` will be assigned values from an empty input, which will result in an error. The time in the format 'HH:MM' is printed, where HH is the hour in 24-hour format and MM is the minute, and the day is printed, where day is 'AM' or 'PM'**
