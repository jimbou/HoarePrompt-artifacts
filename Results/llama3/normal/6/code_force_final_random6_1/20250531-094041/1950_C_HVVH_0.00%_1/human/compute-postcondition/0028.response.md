The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is decreased by 1. So for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 0.
State: **`day` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `h` is an integer between 0 and 23, `m` is an integer between 0 and 59, `_` is increased by 1, stdin contains no input. If `h` is 0, then `day` is 'AM' and `h` is 12. If `h` is not 0, then `day` is either 'PM' or 'AM', if `h` is greater than 12, then `day` is 'PM' and `h` is an integer between -12 and 11. If `h` is less than or equal to 12, then `day` is 'AM' if `h` is 12, otherwise `day` remains 'PM'.**
