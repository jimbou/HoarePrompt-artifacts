Output State: **`day` is 'PM', `n` is at least 0, `h` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is an integer between 0 and 59, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings, each of length 5, representing valid times in 24-hour format**

In this output state, the value of `day` has been updated to 'PM', while the values of `n`, `h`, `m`, and `_` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-1 strings, each of length 5, representing valid times in 24-hour format.
