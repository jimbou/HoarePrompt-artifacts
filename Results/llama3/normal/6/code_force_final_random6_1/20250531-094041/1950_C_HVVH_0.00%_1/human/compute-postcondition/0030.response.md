Output State: **day is 'AM', h is 12, m is an integer between 0 and 59, n is greater than 0, _ is increased by 1, stdin contains no input.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the value 12 to `h`. The second line assigns the value 'AM' to `day`. 

Since `h` is assigned the value 12, which is between 0 and 23, and `day` is assigned the value 'AM', the conditions for `day` and `h` are met. The value of `m` remains unchanged as an integer between 0 and 59. The value of `n` also remains unchanged as greater than 0. The value of `_` is increased by 1. Stdin contains no input.
