Postcondition: ***`day` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer between 0 and 59, `_` is increased by 1, stdin contains no input. If `h` is greater than 12, then `day` is 'PM' and `h` is an integer between -12 and 11. If `h` is less than or equal to 12, then `day` is 'AM' if `h` is 12, otherwise `day` remains 'PM'. However, since stdin contains no input, `h` and `m` will be assigned values from an empty input, which will result in an error.***
