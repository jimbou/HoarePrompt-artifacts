Output State: **`day` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `h` is an integer between 0 and 23, `m` is an integer between 0 and 59, `_` is increased by 1, stdin contains no input. If `h` is 0, then `day` is 'AM' and `h` is 12. If `h` is not 0, then `day` is either 'PM' or 'AM', if `h` is greater than 12, then `day` is 'PM' and `h` is an integer between -12 and 11. If `h` is less than or equal to 12, then `day` is 'AM' if `h` is 12, otherwise `day` remains 'PM'. However, since stdin contains no input, `h` and `m` will be assigned values from an empty input, which will result in an error.**

Note: The code will raise a ValueError because stdin contains no input, and the input() function will not be able to parse the empty input into integers.
