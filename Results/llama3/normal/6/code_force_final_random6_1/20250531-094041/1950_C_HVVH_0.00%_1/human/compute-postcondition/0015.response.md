The code prints a formatted string containing the time in 12-hour format, followed by the day period ('AM' or 'PM'). The time is represented by the variables `h` and `m`, which are the hour and minute, respectively. The `:02d` format specifier is used to pad the hour and minute with leading zeros if they are single digits.

Based on the precondition, the value of `h` can be between 1 and 12, and the value of `m` is not specified but is assumed to be between 0 and 59. The value of `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM', depending on the value of `h`.

Output: **hh:mm (where hh is the hour between 01 and 12, and mm is the minute between 00 and 59), day (where day is either 'AM' or 'PM')**
