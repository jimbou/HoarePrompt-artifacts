Reasoning:

1. The problem statement requires finding the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. The square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.

2. The provided Python program attempts to solve this problem by calculating the squared distance between two pairs of points and then printing the smaller of the two values.

3. However, the program does not correctly calculate the area of the square. The area of a square is the square of the length of its side. The program calculates the squared distance between two points, which is not necessarily the length of the side of the square.

4. The program also does not handle the case where the input points are not in the correct order. The problem statement guarantees that there is a square with corners in the given points, but it does not guarantee that the points are in any particular order.

5. The program also does not handle the case where the input points are not integers. The problem statement guarantees that the coordinates of the corners are integers, but the program does not check for this.

6. The program does not follow the problem's output format. The problem requires the output to be a single integer, the area of the square, but the program prints the smaller of the two squared distances.

7. The program does not handle the case where the input is invalid. The problem statement guarantees that the input is valid, but the program does not check for this.

8. The program does not handle the case where the input is empty. The problem statement guarantees that the input is not empty, but the program does not check for this.

9. The program does not handle the case where the input contains non-numeric characters. The problem statement guarantees that the input contains only integers, but the program does not check for this.

10. The program does not handle the case where the input contains non-integer values. The problem statement guarantees that the input contains only integers, but the program does not check for this.

Correctness: **False**
