The only variable in the loop head is `steps` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `steps` and `t`. If `steps` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `steps` is 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive. For the loop to execute again, `steps` must be increased by 1, so `steps` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **t is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 100 inclusive, steps is 2, stdin contains t-6 testcases, a is an integer between -1000 and 1000 inclusive, b is an integer between -1000 and 1000 inclusive, c is an integer between -1000 and 1000 inclusive, d is an integer between -1000 and 1000 inclusive, e is an integer between -1000 and 1000 inclusive, f is an integer between -1000 and 1000 inclusive, g is an integer between -1000 and 1000 inclusive, h is an integer between -1000 and 1000 inclusive, n is a non-negative integer, x is a non-negative integer. If x is greater than n, then n is printed. Otherwise, the value of x which is a non-negative integer less than or equal to n is being printed, and the value of n is printed.**
