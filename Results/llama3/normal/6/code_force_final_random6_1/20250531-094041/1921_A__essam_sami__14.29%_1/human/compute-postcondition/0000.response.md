The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 100) followed by `t` testcases. After accepting `t`, the stdin contains `t` testcases. Each testcase consists of four lines, each containing two integers `x_i`, `y_i` (-1000 <= `x_i`, `y_i` <= 1000) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with positive area and sides parallel to the coordinate axes.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains `t` testcases. Each testcase consists of four lines, each containing two integers `x_i`, `y_i` (-1000 <= `x_i`, `y_i` <= 1000) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with positive area and sides parallel to the coordinate axes.**
