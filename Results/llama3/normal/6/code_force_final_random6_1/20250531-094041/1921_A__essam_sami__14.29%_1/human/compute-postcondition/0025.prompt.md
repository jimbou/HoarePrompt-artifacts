Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains `t` testcases. Each testcase consists of four lines, each containing two integers `x_i`, `y_i` (-1000 <= `x_i`, `y_i` <= 1000) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with positive area and sides parallel to the coordinate axes.
Code of the loop:
for steps in range(t):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    c, d = map(int, input().split())
    e, f = map(int, input().split())
    g, h = map(int, input().split())
    n = (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)
    x = (c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)
    if x > n:
        print(n)
    else:
        print(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, steps is 0, stdin contains t-1 testcases, a is an integer between -1000 and 1000 inclusive, b is an integer between -1000 and 1000 inclusive, c is an integer between -1000 and 1000 inclusive, d is an integer between -1000 and 1000 inclusive, e is an integer between -1000 and 1000 inclusive, f is an integer between -1000 and 1000 inclusive, g is an integer between -1000 and 1000 inclusive, h is an integer between -1000 and 1000 inclusive, n is a non-negative integer, x is a non-negative integer. If x is greater than n, then n is printed. Otherwise, the value of x which is a non-negative integer less than or equal to n is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, steps is 1, stdin contains t-6 testcases, a is an integer between -1000 and 1000 inclusive, b is an integer between -1000 and 1000 inclusive, c is an integer between -1000 and 1000 inclusive, d is an integer between -1000 and 1000 inclusive, e is an integer between -1000 and 1000 inclusive, f is an integer between -1000 and 1000 inclusive, g is an integer between -1000 and 1000 inclusive, h is an integer between -1000 and 1000 inclusive, n is a non-negative integer, x is a non-negative integer. If x is greater than n, then n is printed. Otherwise, the value of x which is a non-negative integer less than or equal to n is being printed, and the value of n is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 100 inclusive, steps is 2, stdin contains t-10 testcases, a is an integer between -1000 and 1000 inclusive, b is an integer between -1000 and 1000 inclusive, c is an integer between -1000 and 1000 inclusive, d is an integer between -1000 and 1000 inclusive, e is an integer between -1000 and 1000 inclusive, f is an integer between -1000 and 1000 inclusive, g is an integer between -1000 and 1000 inclusive, h is an integer between -1000 and 1000 inclusive, n is a non-negative integer, x is a non-negative integer. If x is greater than n, then n is printed. Otherwise, the value of x which is a non-negative integer less than or equal to n is being printed, and the value of n is printed, and the value of x is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
