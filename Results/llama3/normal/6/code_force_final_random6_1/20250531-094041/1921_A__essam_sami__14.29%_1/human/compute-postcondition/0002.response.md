Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, steps is 0, stdin contains t-1 testcases, a is an integer between -1000 and 1000 inclusive, b is an integer between -1000 and 1000 inclusive, c is an integer between -1000 and 1000 inclusive, d is an integer between -1000 and 1000 inclusive, e is an integer between -1000 and 1000 inclusive, f is an integer between -1000 and 1000 inclusive, g is an integer between -1000 and 1000 inclusive, h is an integer between -1000 and 1000 inclusive, n is a non-negative integer, x is a non-negative integer.**

In this output state, the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, and `h` are the coordinates of the corners of a square with positive area and sides parallel to the coordinate axes, as specified in the initial state. The values of `n` and `x` are the results of the calculations performed in the code, which represent the squared distances between the points `(a, b)` and `(e, f)`, and `(c, d)` and `(g, h)`, respectively. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the value of `steps` is still 0. The stdin now contains `t-1` testcases, as one testcase has been processed.
