Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the area of the square. The issue lies in the way it calculates the side length of the square. The program calculates the distance between two points (a, b) and (e, f), and another distance between points (c, d) and (g, h). However, these points are not necessarily adjacent corners of the square, so the calculated distances are not necessarily the side length of the square.

A counterexample is when the input is:

1 2
4 5
1 5
4 2

The program will calculate the distance between (1, 2) and (1, 5) as the side length, which is 3, and the distance between (4, 5) and (4, 2) as the side length, which is also 3. However, the correct side length of the square is the distance between (1, 2) and (4, 2), or (1, 5) and (4, 5), which is 3. However, the program will print the square of the minimum of these two distances, which is 9, instead of the correct area which is 9.

To fix this issue, the program should find the correct side length of the square by calculating the distance between adjacent corners. One way to do this is to find the minimum and maximum x-coordinates and y-coordinates, and then calculate the side length as the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates or y-coordinates.
