Based on the precondition, the value of `x` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to `n`. If `x` is greater than `n`, then `n` is printed. However, since `x` is described as a non-negative integer less than or equal to `n`, it means that `x` will never be greater than `n`. Therefore, the value of `x` will always be printed.

Output: **x (where x is a non-negative integer less than or equal to n)**
