To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `steps` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, which ensures that the loop will execute. However, we need to adjust the state of `steps` to reflect the starting point of the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `steps` is 0, stdin contains `t` testcases. Each testcase consists of four lines, each containing two integers `x_i`, `y_i` (-1000 <= `x_i`, `y_i` <= 1000) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with positive area and sides parallel to the coordinate axes.**
