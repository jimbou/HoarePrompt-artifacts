#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads an integer t from standard input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four lines of input, each containing two integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with positive area and sides parallel to the coordinate axes. It calculates the squared distances between the first and third corners (n) and the second and fourth corners (x). If x is greater than n, it prints the value of n; otherwise, it prints the value of x. This process is repeated for all t test cases.
