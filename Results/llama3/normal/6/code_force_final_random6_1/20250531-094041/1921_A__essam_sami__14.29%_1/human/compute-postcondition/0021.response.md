Based on the precondition, the value of `x` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, when the `print(x)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `x`, which is a non-negative integer less than or equal to `n`.

Output: **x (where x is a non-negative integer less than or equal to n)**
