Output State: **a is a list of non-negative integers, p is a list of integers such that 1 <= p_i <= len(p), s is a list of two non-negative integers such that 1 <= s_i <= len(p) and s is now equal to p[s], k is greater than or equal to 0, n is the length of p, mx is equal to the maximum of mx and cur + k * a[s], cur is equal to cur + a[s], and vis is a list of n integers where vis[s] is equal to 1**.

In this output state, the value of `vis[s]` has been updated to 1, indicating that the index `s` has been visited. The value of `mx` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value and the sum of `cur` and `k` times `a[s]`, reflecting the new maximum value that can be achieved. The value of `cur` has been incremented by `a[s]`, representing the accumulation of values. The value of `k` has been decremented by 1, indicating a reduction in the number of remaining operations. The value of `s` has been updated to be equal to `p[s]`, representing a move to a new index. All other variables remain unchanged.
