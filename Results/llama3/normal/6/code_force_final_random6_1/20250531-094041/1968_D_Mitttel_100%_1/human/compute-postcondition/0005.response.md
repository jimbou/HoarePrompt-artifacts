To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `vis`, `s`, and `k`.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `not vis[s]` and `k > 0`. At the end of the last iteration, `vis[s]` is 1, which means `vis[s]` needs to be adjusted to 0 for the loop to execute again. Additionally, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, but it needs to be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.

The state of `s` does not need to be adjusted, as it is not a condition for the loop to execute again.

The states of `a`, `p`, `n`, `mx`, `cur` do not need to be adjusted, as they are not conditions for the loop to execute again.

State: **`a` is a list of non-negative integers, `p` is a list of integers such that 1 <= p_i <= len(p), `s` is a list of two non-negative integers such that 1 <= s_i <= len(p) and `s` is now equal to `p[s]`, `k` is greater than 0, `n` is the length of `p`, `mx` is equal to the maximum of `mx` and `cur + k * a[s]`, `cur` is equal to `cur + a[s]`, and `vis` is a list of `n` integers where `vis[s]` is equal to 0**
