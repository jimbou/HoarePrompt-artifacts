Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the "Permutation game" problem. The problem involves two players, Bodya and Sasha, who start at different positions in a permutation and move according to certain rules, accumulating scores based on the values in an array. The goal is to determine who wins the game after a specified number of turns.

The program first reads the input, which includes the number of test cases, the length of the permutation, the duration of the game, and the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha. It then reads the permutation and the array.

The program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the maximum score a player can achieve starting from a given position and playing for a specified number of turns. This function uses a greedy approach, always choosing the move that maximizes the score.

The main part of the program iterates over each test case, calls `func_1` for both Bodya and Sasha, and compares their scores to determine the winner.

The program correctly implements the rules of the game and the greedy strategy for maximizing scores. It also handles the case where the players have the same score, in which case it outputs "Draw".

However, there is a subtle issue with the program. In the `func_1` function, the `vis` array is used to keep track of visited positions. However, this array is not necessary, as the permutation is guaranteed to be a cycle (i.e., every position is reachable from every other position). Therefore, the `vis` array can be removed, and the function can simply iterate over the permutation until it reaches the starting position again.

Despite this minor issue, the program is correct and will produce the correct output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
