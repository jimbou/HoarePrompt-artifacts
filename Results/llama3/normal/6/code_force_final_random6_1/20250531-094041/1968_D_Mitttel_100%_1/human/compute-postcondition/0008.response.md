Output State: **The program returns the maximum of its original value and cur + k * a[s], where cur is equal to its original value plus a[s], k is equal to 0, a[s] is a non-negative integer from list a, and s is a list of two non-negative integers such that 1 <= s_i <= len(p) and s is now equal to p[s].**
