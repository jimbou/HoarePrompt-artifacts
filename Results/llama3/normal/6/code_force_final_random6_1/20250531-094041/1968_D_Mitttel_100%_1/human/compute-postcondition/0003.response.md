According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `vis`, `s`, and `k`. If `vis[s]` is not equal to 1 and `k` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `vis[s]` is equal to 1 and `k` is equal to `k-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `vis[s]` needs to be adjusted to not equal to 1 and `k` needs to be adjusted to greater than 0.

State: **a is a list of non-negative integers, p is a list of integers such that 1 <= p_i <= len(p), s is a list of two non-negative integers such that 1 <= s_i <= len(p) and s is now equal to p[s], k is greater than 0, n is the length of p, mx is equal to the maximum of mx and cur + k * a[s], cur is equal to cur + a[s], and vis is a list of n integers where vis[s] is not equal to 1**
