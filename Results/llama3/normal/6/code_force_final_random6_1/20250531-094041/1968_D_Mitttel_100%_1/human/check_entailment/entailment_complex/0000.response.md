Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the "Permutation game" based on the problem description.

The program first reads the input and initializes the necessary variables. It then calls the function `func_1` twice, once for Bodya's starting position and once for Sasha's starting position, to calculate the maximum score each player can achieve.

The function `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum score by traversing the permutation list based on the given indices and starting point, with a limited number of steps. It keeps track of the maximum score that can be achieved by adding the current value at the starting point to the maximum value that can be obtained by traversing the list k times, starting from the current point.

The program then compares the scores of Bodya and Sasha and prints the result accordingly.

Correctness: **True**
