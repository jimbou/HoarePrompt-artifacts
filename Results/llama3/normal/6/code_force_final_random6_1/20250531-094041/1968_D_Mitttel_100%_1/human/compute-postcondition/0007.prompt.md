Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is a list of non-negative integers, p is a list of integers such that 1 <= p_i <= len(p), s is a list of two non-negative integers such that 1 <= s_i <= len(p), k is a non-negative integer, n is the length of p, mx is 0, cur is 0, and vis is a list of n zeros.
Code of the loop:
while not vis[s] and k > 0:
    vis[s] = 1
    mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])
    cur += a[s]
    k -= 1
    s = p[s]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: a is a list of non-negative integers, p is a list of integers such that 1 <= p_i <= len(p), s is a list of two non-negative integers such that 1 <= s_i <= len(p) and s is now equal to p[s], k is greater than 0 and k is now equal to k-1, n is the length of p, mx is equal to the maximum of mx and cur + k * a[s], cur is equal to cur + a[s], and vis is a list of n integers where vis[s] is now equal to 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: a is a list of non-negative integers, p is a list of integers such that 1 <= p_i <= len(p), s is a list of two non-negative integers such that 1 <= s_i <= len(p) and s is now equal to p[s], k is greater than or equal to 0, n is the length of p, mx is equal to the maximum of mx and cur + k * a[s], cur is equal to cur + a[s], and vis is a list of n integers where vis[s] is equal to 1
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: a is a list of non-negative integers, p is a list of integers such that 1 <= p_i <= len(p), s is a list of two non-negative integers such that 1 <= s_i <= len(p) and s is now equal to p[s], k is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, n is the length of p, mx is equal to the maximum of its original value and cur + k * a[s] where k is its original value, cur is equal to its original value plus a[s], and vis is a list of n integers where vis[s] is equal to 1 and all other values remain unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
