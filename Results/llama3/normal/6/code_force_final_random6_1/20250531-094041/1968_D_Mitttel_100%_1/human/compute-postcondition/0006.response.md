Output State: **a is a list of non-negative integers, p is a list of integers such that 1 <= p_i <= len(p), s is a list of two non-negative integers such that 1 <= s_i <= len(p) and s is now equal to p[s], k is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, n is the length of p, mx is equal to the maximum of its original value and cur + k * a[s] where k is its original value, cur is equal to its original value plus a[s], and vis is a list of n integers where vis[s] is equal to 1 and all other values remain unchanged.**

The code modifies the values of `vis`, `mx`, `cur`, `k`, and `s`. The value of `vis[s]` is set to 1. The value of `mx` is updated to be the maximum of its original value and `cur + k * a[s]`, where `k` is its original value. The value of `cur` is incremented by `a[s]`. The value of `k` is decremented by 1. The value of `s` is updated to be equal to `p[s]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
