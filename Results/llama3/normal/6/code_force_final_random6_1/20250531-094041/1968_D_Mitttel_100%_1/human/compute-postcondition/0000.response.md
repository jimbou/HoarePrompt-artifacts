Output State: **a is a list of non-negative integers, p is a list of integers such that 1 <= p_i <= len(p), s is a list of two non-negative integers such that 1 <= s_i <= len(p), k is a non-negative integer, n is the length of p, mx is 0, cur is 0, and vis is a list of n zeros.**

The code initializes several variables without modifying the initial state's variables. The variable `n` is assigned the length of list `p`, which is a list of integers with values between 1 and the length of `p`. The variables `mx` and `cur` are initialized to 0, and `vis` is created as a list of `n` zeros, where `n` is the length of `p`.
