#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of non-negative integers, p is a list of integers such that 1 <= p_i <= len(p), s is a list of two non-negative integers such that 1 <= s_i <= len(p), and k is a non-negative integer.
    n = len(p)
    mx = 0
    cur = 0
    vis = [(0) for _ in range(n)]

    #State: a is a list of non-negative integers, p is a list of integers such that 1 <= p_i <= len(p), s is a list of two non-negative integers such that 1 <= s_i <= len(p) and s is now equal to p[s], k is equal to 0, n is the length of p, mx is equal to the maximum of its original value and cur + k * a[s] where k is its original value, cur is equal to its original value plus a[s], and vis is a list of n integers where vis[s] is equal to 1 and all other values remain unchanged.
    return mx
    #The program returns the maximum of its original value and cur + k * a[s], where cur is equal to its original value plus a[s], k is equal to 0, a[s] is a non-negative integer from list a, and s is a list of two non-negative integers such that 1 <= s_i <= len(p) and s is now equal to p[s].

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the maximum value that can be obtained by traversing a list of non-negative integers (a) based on a given list of indices (p) and a starting point (s), with a limited number of steps (k). It returns the maximum value that can be achieved by adding the current value at the starting point to the maximum value that can be obtained by traversing the list k times, starting from the current point. The function modifies the starting point (s) to be the next index in the list (p[s]) and updates the current value (cur) by adding the value at the current starting point (a[s]). The function repeats this process until it has traversed the list k times or until it reaches a point that has already been visited. The function returns the maximum value obtained during this traversal.
