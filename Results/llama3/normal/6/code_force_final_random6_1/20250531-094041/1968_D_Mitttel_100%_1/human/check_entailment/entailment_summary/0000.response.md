Reasoning:

The provided program is correct. It accurately implements the logic to determine the winner of the "Permutation game" based on the given problem description. The program uses a function `func_1` to calculate the maximum score that can be achieved by each player, considering the permutation `p` and the array `a`. The function iterates through the permutation, keeping track of the maximum score that can be obtained by staying at the current position or moving to the next position. The program then compares the scores of both players and determines the winner based on the comparison.

The execution summary provided is also accurate, as it describes the functionality of the `func_1` function and its purpose in the program.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
