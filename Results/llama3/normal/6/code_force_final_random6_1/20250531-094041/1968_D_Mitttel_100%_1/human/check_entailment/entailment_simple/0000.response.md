Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine the winner of a game based on a permutation and an array. The game involves two players, Bodya and Sasha, who start at different positions in the permutation and move simultaneously for a certain number of turns. The player with the higher score at the end of the game wins.

The program uses a function `func_1` to calculate the maximum score that can be achieved by a player starting at a given position. This function iterates through the permutation, keeping track of the current score and the maximum score that can be achieved by staying at the current position or moving to the next position.

The main part of the program reads the input, calls `func_1` for both Bodya and Sasha's starting positions, and compares their scores to determine the winner.

The program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the execution states provided as comments. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum score that can be achieved by a player starting at a given position, and the main part of the program correctly compares the scores of Bodya and Sasha to determine the winner.

Correctness: **True**
