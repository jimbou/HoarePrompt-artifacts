Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the game logic. In the game, each player can either stay at their current position or move to the position indicated by the permutation. However, in the program, the player always moves to the position indicated by the permutation. This means that the program does not consider the case where a player chooses to stay at their current position.

For example, consider the case where the permutation is [2, 1], the array is [10, 5], and the starting positions are 1 and 2. In this case, the optimal strategy for both players is to stay at their current position, because moving would result in a lower score. However, the program would have both players move to the other position, resulting in a lower score for both players.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the game logic and is incorrect.
