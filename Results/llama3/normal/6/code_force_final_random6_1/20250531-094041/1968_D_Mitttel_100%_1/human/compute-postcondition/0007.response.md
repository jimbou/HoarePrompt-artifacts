Output State: **a is a list of non-negative integers, p is a list of integers such that 1 <= p_i <= len(p), s is a list of two non-negative integers such that 1 <= s_i <= len(p) and s is now equal to p[s], k is equal to 0, n is the length of p, mx is equal to the maximum of its original value and cur + k * a[s] where k is its original value, cur is equal to its original value plus a[s], and vis is a list of n integers where vis[s] is equal to 1 and all other values remain unchanged.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the variables in the loop head and body have reached their final values. The list 'a' and 'p' remain unchanged, while 's' has been updated to its final value based on the last iteration of the loop. The variable 'k' has been decremented to 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The variable 'mx' has been updated to its maximum value based on the calculations performed during the loop iterations. The variable 'cur' has been updated to its final value based on the last iteration of the loop. The list 'vis' has been updated to reflect the final values of the variables in the loop head and body.
