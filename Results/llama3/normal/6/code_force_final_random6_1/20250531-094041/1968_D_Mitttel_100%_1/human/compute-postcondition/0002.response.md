Output State: **a is a list of non-negative integers, p is a list of integers such that 1 <= p_i <= len(p), s is a list of two non-negative integers such that 1 <= s_i <= len(p) and s is now equal to p[s], k is greater than 0 and k is now equal to k-1, n is the length of p, mx is equal to the maximum of mx and cur + k * a[s], cur is equal to cur + a[s], and vis is a list of n integers where vis[s] is now equal to 1.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to `p[s]`, indicating that the value of `s` has been replaced by the value at index `s` in the list `p`. The value of `k` has been decremented by 1, and the value of `mx` has been updated to the maximum of its previous value and the sum of `cur` and `k` times the value of `a` at index `s`. The value of `cur` has been incremented by the value of `a` at index `s`, and the value of `vis` at index `s` has been set to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
