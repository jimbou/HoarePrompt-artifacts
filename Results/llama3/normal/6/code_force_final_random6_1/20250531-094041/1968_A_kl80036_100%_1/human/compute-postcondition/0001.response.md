Output State: **x is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, y is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive, stdin contains a series of integers (each representing a test case), i is 0**

The code first assigns the integer value of the input to `x`, which is between 1 and 1000 inclusive. This means that `x` is now an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive. The second line assigns the value of `x - 1` to `y`, making `y` an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive. No other variables are affected. The value of `i` remains 0, and stdin still contains a series of integers (each representing a test case).
