Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) â€” the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

Example

Input

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (the number of test cases) and then a series of integers (each representing a test case). The number of test cases is between 1 and 1000 inclusive. Each test case is an integer between 2 and 1000 inclusive.
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        y = x - 1
        
        print(y)
        
    #State: x is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, y is an integer between -999 and 999 inclusive, stdin is empty, i is equal to the number of test cases, and y which is an integer between -999 and 999 inclusive is being printed

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case is an integer between 2 and 1000, and prints the result of subtracting 1 from each test case. The function processes between 1 and 1000 test cases, and after execution, the standard input is empty, and the results are printed to the console.
