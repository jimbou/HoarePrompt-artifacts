The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `x`. Since the value determined by `int(input())` is at least 3, `x` becomes at least 3. The second line assigns the value of `x - 1` to `y`, making `y` equal to at least 2. The value of `i` is not affected by the code, so it remains 2. Stdin now contains one fewer integer.

Output State: **x is at least 3, y is at least 2, i is 2, stdin contains at least one fewer integer**
