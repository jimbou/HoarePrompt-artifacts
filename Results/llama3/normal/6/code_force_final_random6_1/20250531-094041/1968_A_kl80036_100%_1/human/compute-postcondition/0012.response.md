Output State: **x is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, y is an integer between -999 and 999 inclusive, stdin is empty, i is equal to the number of test cases, and y which is an integer between -999 and 999 inclusive is being printed**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed for all the test cases, and the value of y is being printed for the last test case. The value of x is still an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, and the value of y is an integer between -999 and 999 inclusive, as it is calculated as x - 1. The stdin is empty, as all the test cases have been processed. The value of i is equal to the number of test cases, as it is the loop counter.
