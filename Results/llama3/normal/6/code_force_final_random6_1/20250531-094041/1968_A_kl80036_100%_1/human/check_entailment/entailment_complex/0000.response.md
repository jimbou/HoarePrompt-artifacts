Reasoning:

The problem statement asks to find any integer y (1 â‰¤ y < x) such that gcd(x, y) + y is maximum possible. The given program simply subtracts 1 from each test case x and prints the result as y.

The key observation here is that for any x, gcd(x, x-1) is always 1, because x and x-1 are consecutive integers and therefore coprime. Therefore, gcd(x, x-1) + (x-1) is equal to x, which is the maximum possible value for gcd(x, y) + y.

Since the program always prints x-1 as y, it ensures that gcd(x, y) + y is maximum possible, which satisfies the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
