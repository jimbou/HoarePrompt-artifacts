Output State: **x is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, y is an integer between -1 and 999 inclusive, stdin contains at least one fewer integer, i is 1**

In this output state, the value of `x` is updated to be an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, as it is assigned the value of the input from stdin. The value of `y` is updated to be an integer between -1 and 999 inclusive, as it is assigned the value of `x - 1`. The number of integers in stdin is reduced by at least one, as one integer is read and assigned to `x`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 1.
