The only objects in the loop head are variables  i and input(), so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input().  If the input() is at least 1 the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (the number of test cases) and then a series of integers (each representing a test case). So for the loop to be executed  the input() must be at least 1 and the i is 0.
State: **stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (the number of test cases) and then a series of integers (each representing a test case). The number of test cases is between 1 and 1000 inclusive. Each test case is an integer between 2 and 1000 inclusive, i is 0, input() must be at least 1**
