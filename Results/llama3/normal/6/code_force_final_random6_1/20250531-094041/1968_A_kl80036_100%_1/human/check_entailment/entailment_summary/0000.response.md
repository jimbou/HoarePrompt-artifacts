Reasoning:

The given program is correct because it correctly implements the problem's requirements. The problem asks to find any integer y (1 â‰¤ y < x) such that gcd(x, y) + y is maximum possible. The program achieves this by simply subtracting 1 from the input x, which results in the maximum possible value of gcd(x, y) + y.

The reason this works is that the gcd of two numbers is always less than or equal to the smaller of the two numbers. Therefore, when y is x-1, the gcd(x, y) is 1, and the sum gcd(x, y) + y is x-1 + 1 = x, which is the maximum possible value.

The program correctly reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by subtracting 1 from the input, and prints the result. The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected.

Correctness: **True**
