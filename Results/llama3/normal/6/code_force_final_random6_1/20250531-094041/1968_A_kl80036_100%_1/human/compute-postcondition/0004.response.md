To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the variables and objects in the loop head and how they change from the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for i in range(int(input())):`. The variables and objects involved are `i`, `input()`, and `stdin` (since `input()` reads from `stdin`).

From the previous iteration, we know:
- `x` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
- `y` is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive.
- `stdin` contains a series of integers (each representing a test case).
- `i` is 0.
- The value of `y`, which is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive, is being printed.

To execute the loop again, we need to consider how `i` and `input()` change, as these are the variables directly involved in the loop condition.

1. **`i`**: Since `i` is in `range(int(input()))`, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 because that's how `range` works in Python. So, `i` becomes 1.

2. **`input()`**: The loop condition depends on `int(input())`, which means the loop will continue as long as there are more integers to read from `stdin`. Since we are not modifying `stdin` directly but rather consuming its input through `input()`, for the loop to execute again, `stdin` must contain at least one more integer.

3. **`stdin`**: Since one integer has been consumed by the previous iteration (because `input()` was called), for the loop to execute again, `stdin` must contain at least one more integer.

4. **`x` and `y`**: These variables are not directly involved in the loop condition, so their states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again. However, their values might change within the loop body, but that's not relevant for determining the state at the start of the next iteration based on the loop head alone.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `y` is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive, `stdin` contains at least one more integer (each representing a test case), `i` is 1**
