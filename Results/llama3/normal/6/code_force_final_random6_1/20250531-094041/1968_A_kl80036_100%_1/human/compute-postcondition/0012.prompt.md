Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (the number of test cases) and then a series of integers (each representing a test case). The number of test cases is between 1 and 1000 inclusive. Each test case is an integer between 2 and 1000 inclusive.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    x = int(input())
    y = x - 1
    print(y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: x is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, y is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive, stdin contains a series of integers (each representing a test case), i is 0, and the value of y which is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: x is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, y is an integer between -1 and 999 inclusive, stdin contains at least one fewer integer, i is 1, and y is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: x is at least 3, y is at least 2, i is 2, stdin contains at least one fewer integer, and y which is at least 2 is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
