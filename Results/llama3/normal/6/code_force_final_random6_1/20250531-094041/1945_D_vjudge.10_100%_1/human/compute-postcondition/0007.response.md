Output State: **`pergunta` is the minimum of its previous value and `min(a[n-2], b[n-2])` + `a[n-2]`, `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n`, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= `m` <= `n` <= 200000 and 1 <= `a_i`, `b_i` <= 10^9 for all `i`, `x` is `min(a[n-2], b[n-2])`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-2`.**

In this output state, the value of `pergunta` has been updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the sum of `x` (which is the minimum of `a[n-2]` and `b[n-2]`) and `a[i]` (which is `a[n-2]`). The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
