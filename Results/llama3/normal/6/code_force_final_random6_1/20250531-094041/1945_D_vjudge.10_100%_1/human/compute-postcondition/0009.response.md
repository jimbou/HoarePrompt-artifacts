Output State: **`pergunta` is the minimum of its previous value and `min(a[n-2], b[n-2])` + `a[n-2]` if `i` is less than `m`, otherwise `pergunta` remains unchanged. `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n`, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= `m` <= `n` <= 200000 and 1 <= `a_i`, `b_i` <= 10^9 for all `i`, `x` is `min(a[n-2], b[n-2])` + `min(a[n-2], b[n-2])`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-2`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `x` has been updated to be the sum of the minimum of `a[n-2]` and `b[n-2]` with itself, while the other variables remain unchanged. The lists `a` and `b` still have length `n`, and the integers `n` and `m` still satisfy the given constraints. The value of `pergunta` is still dependent on the comparison between `i` and `m`, and `n` is still greater than 0. The value of `i` is still `n-2`.
