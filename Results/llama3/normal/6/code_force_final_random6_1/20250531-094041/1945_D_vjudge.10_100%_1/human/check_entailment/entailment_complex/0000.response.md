Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first m people in line. It iterates over the list of people in reverse order, keeping track of the minimum cost to reach each position. The minimum cost to reach a position is the minimum of the cost to reach the previous position and the cost to bribe the person at the current position.

The program also correctly handles the edge cases, such as when m is 1 or when n is 1. In these cases, the program still produces the correct output.

The use of the `float('inf')` to initialize the `pergunta` variable is also correct, as it ensures that the minimum cost is initialized to a value that is greater than any possible cost.

The program's time complexity is O(n), which is efficient for the given constraints.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
