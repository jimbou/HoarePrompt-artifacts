To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):`, which means that `i` will decrease by 1 in each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n-1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be greater than or equal to 0 (since the loop iterates from `n-1` to `-1`).

Since `n` must be greater than 0, we can conclude that `n` is at least 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`pergunta` is an integer, `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n`, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= `m` <= `n` <= 200000 and 1 <= `a_i`, `b_i` <= 10^9 for all `i`, `x` is `min(a[n-2], b[n-2])`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-2`. If `i` is less than `m`, `pergunta` is the minimum of its previous value and `x` + `a[i]`.**

Note that we only adjusted the states of `i` and `x`, as they are the only objects involved in the loop head. The other variables (`pergunta`, `a`, `b`, `n`, and `m`) remain unchanged.
