Output State: **`pergunta` is the minimum of its previous value and `min(a[n-3], b[n-3])` + `a[n-3]` + `min(a[n-3], b[n-3])` if `i` is less than `m`, otherwise `pergunta` remains unchanged, `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n`, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= `m` <= `n` <= 200000 and 1 <= `a_i`, `b_i` <= 10^9 for all `i`, `x` is 3 * `min(a[n-3], b[n-3])`, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is `n-3`**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been updated to 3 times the minimum of `a[n-3]` and `b[n-3]`, since `x` was initially `min(a[n-3], b[n-3])` + `min(a[n-3], b[n-3])` and now it has been incremented by `min(a[i], b[i])` which is equal to `min(a[n-3], b[n-3])`. The other variables remain unchanged.
