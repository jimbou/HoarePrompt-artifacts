This function calculates and prints the minimum value between the initial value of 'pergunta' and the sum of 'a[i]' and the cumulative sum of the minimum values between 'a[j]' and 'b[j]' for all 'j' from 'i' to 'n-1', for all 'i' from 0 to 'm-1'. The function takes no arguments and returns no value, but it modifies the 'pergunta' variable and prints the result.
