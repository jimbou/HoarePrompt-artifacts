Output State: **`pergunta` is the minimum of its previous value and `x + a[i]`, `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n`, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= `m` <= `n` <= 200000 and 1 <= `a_i`, `b_i` <= 10^9 for all `i`, `x` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-1` and the current value of `i` is less than `m`.**

In natural language, the output state is that the value of `pergunta` has been updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the sum of `x` (which is 0) and the `i-th` element of list `a`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
