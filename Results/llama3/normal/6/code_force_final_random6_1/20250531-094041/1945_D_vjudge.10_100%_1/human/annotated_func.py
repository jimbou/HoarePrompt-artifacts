#State of the program right berfore the function call: pergunta is an integer, a and b are lists of integers of length n, n and m are integers such that 1 <= m <= n <= 200000 and 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9 for all i.
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if i < m:
            pergunta = min(pergunta, x + a[i])
        
        x += min(a[i], b[i])
        
    #State: pergunta is the minimum of its initial value and the sum of a[i] and the sum of min(a[j], b[j]) for all j from i to n-1, for all i from 0 to m-1, a and b are lists of integers of length n, n and m are integers such that 1 <= m <= n <= 200000 and 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9 for all i, x is the sum of min(a[i], b[i]) for all i from 0 to n-1, n must be greater than or equal to 0, i is -1.
    print(pergunta)
    #This is printed: pergunta (where pergunta is the minimum of its initial value and the sum of a[i] and the sum of min(a[j], b[j]) for all j from i to n-1, for all i from 0 to m-1)

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and prints the minimum value between the initial value of 'pergunta' and the sum of 'a[i]' and the cumulative sum of the minimum values between 'a[j]' and 'b[j]' for all 'j' from 'i' to 'n-1', for all 'i' from 0 to 'm-1'. The function takes no arguments and returns no value, but it modifies the 'pergunta' variable and prints the result.
