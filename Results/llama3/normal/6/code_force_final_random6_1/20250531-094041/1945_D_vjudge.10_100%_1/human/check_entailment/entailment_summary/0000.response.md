Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. The function `func_1` calculates the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to reach a position among the first `m` people in the queue.

The program initializes `pergunta` to infinity and then iterates over the queue from the end to the beginning. For each position `i`, it calculates the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to reach that position by considering two options: either Kirill pays `a[i]` coins to the person at position `i` and then pays the minimum of `a[j]` and `b[j]` coins to the people at positions `j` such that `j < i`, or Kirill pays the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` coins to the person at position `i` and then pays the minimum of `a[j]` and `b[j]` coins to the people at positions `j` such that `j < i`.

The program then updates `pergunta` with the minimum of its current value and the calculated value for the current position `i`. Finally, it prints the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to reach a position among the first `m` people in the queue.

Correctness: **True**
