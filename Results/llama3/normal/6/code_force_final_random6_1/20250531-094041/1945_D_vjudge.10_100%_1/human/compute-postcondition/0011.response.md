Output State: **`pergunta` is the minimum of its previous value and `min(a[n-3], b[n-3])` + `a[n-3]` + `min(a[n-3], b[n-3])`, `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n`, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= `m` <= `n` <= 200000 and 1 <= `a_i`, `b_i` <= 10^9 for all `i`, `x` is `min(a[n-3], b[n-3])` + `min(a[n-3], b[n-3])`, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is `n-3`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `pergunta` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the sum of the minimum of `a[n-3]` and `b[n-3]`, `a[n-3]`, and the minimum of `a[n-3]` and `b[n-3]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
