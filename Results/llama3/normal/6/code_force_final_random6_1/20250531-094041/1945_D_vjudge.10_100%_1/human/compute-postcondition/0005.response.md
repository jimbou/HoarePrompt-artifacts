Output State: **`pergunta` is an integer, `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n`, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= `m` <= `n` <= 200000 and 1 <= `a_i`, `b_i` <= 10^9 for all `i`, `x` is `min(a[n-1], b[n-1])`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`. If `i` is less than `m`, `pergunta` is the minimum of its previous value and `x` + `a[i]`.**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been updated to be the minimum of `a[n-1]` and `b[n-1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition "If `i` is less than `m`, `pergunta` is the minimum of its previous value and `x` + `a[i]`" is still valid, but since `i` is `n-1`, this condition is not triggered.
