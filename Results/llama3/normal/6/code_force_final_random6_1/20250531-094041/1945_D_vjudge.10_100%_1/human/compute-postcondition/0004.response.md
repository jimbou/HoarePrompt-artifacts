Postcondition: ***pergunta is an integer, a and b are lists of integers of length n, n and m are integers such that 1 <= m <= n <= 200000 and 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9 for all i, x is 0, n must be greater than 0, i is n-1. If i is less than m, pergunta is the minimum of its previous value and x + a[i].***
