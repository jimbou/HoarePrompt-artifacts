Output State: **pergunta is an integer, a and b are lists of integers of length n, n and m are integers such that 1 <= m <= n <= 200000 and 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9 for all i, x is 0**

In this output state, the values of the variables pergunta, a, b, n, and m remain unchanged. The only change is the introduction of a new variable x, which is assigned the value 0. The length and bounds of the lists a and b, as well as the range of the integers n and m, are still valid.
