Postcondition: ***`pergunta` is the minimum of its previous value and `min(a[n-3], b[n-3])` + `a[n-3]` + `min(a[n-3], b[n-3])` if `i` is less than `m`, otherwise `pergunta` remains unchanged, `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n`, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= `m` <= `n` <= 200000 and 1 <= `a_i`, `b_i` <= 10^9 for all `i`, `x` is `min(a[n-3], b[n-3])` + `min(a[n-3], b[n-3])`, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is `n-3`***
