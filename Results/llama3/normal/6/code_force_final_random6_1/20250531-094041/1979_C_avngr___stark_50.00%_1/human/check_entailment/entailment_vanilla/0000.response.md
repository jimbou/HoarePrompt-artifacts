Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem where the goal is to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k_i` for each outcome.

3. It calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all the multipliers `k_i` and stores it in the variable `m`. This is done to ensure that the total amount of coins bet is a multiple of all the multipliers.

4. It then calculates the amount of coins to bet on each outcome `c_i` by dividing the LCM `m` by the corresponding multiplier `k_i`. This is done to minimize the total amount of coins bet while ensuring that the number of coins received back for each winning outcome is strictly greater than the total amount of coins bet.

5. The program then calculates the highest common factor (HCF) of all the `c_i` values using the `func_1` function. This is done to further minimize the total amount of coins bet by dividing all the `c_i` values by their HCF.

6. Finally, the program checks if the total amount of coins bet (i.e., the sum of all `c_i` values) is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each winning outcome (i.e., `m / hcf`). If it is, the program prints the `c_i` values; otherwise, it prints -1.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
