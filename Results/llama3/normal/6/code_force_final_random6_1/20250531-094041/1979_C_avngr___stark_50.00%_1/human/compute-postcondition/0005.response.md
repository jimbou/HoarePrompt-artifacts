The only objects in the loop head are variables  num and list  numbers, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list numbers.  If the list has at least 4 integers the loop executes again for the fourth time. At the end of the last iteration, numbers has at least 3 integers, num is the third integer in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 4 integers and the num is the fourth integer in the list.
State: **`numbers` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 integers, `hcf` is the greatest common divisor of the first three integers in the list `numbers`, `num` is the fourth integer in the list**
