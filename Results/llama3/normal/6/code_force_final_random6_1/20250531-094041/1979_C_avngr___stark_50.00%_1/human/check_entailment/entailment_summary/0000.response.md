Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem where you need to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. The program takes the number of outcomes and their respective multipliers as input and calculates the bets for each outcome.

The program first calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all the multipliers, which is the smallest number that is a multiple of all the multipliers. It then calculates the bets for each outcome by dividing the LCM by the respective multiplier. The program also calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the bets and divides each bet by the GCD to minimize the total amount of coins bet.

The program then checks if the total amount of coins bet is less than the LCM divided by the GCD. If it is, the program prints the bets for each outcome. Otherwise, it prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required.

The execution summary shows that the function `func_1` calculates the GCD of all integers in a given list of numbers, which is used in the program to minimize the total amount of coins bet.

Based on the problem description and the execution summary, the program appears to be correct. It correctly calculates the bets for each outcome and checks if the total amount of coins bet is less than the LCM divided by the GCD.

Correctness: **True**
