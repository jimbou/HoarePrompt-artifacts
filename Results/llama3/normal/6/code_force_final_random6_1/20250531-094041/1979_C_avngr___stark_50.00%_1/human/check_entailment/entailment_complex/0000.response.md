Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of distributing coins among different outcomes in a game such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program first calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all the multipliers (k_i) by multiplying them together. Then, for each outcome, it calculates the amount of coins to bet by dividing the LCM by the multiplier for that outcome. This ensures that the amount of coins received back for each winning outcome is at least the LCM.

The program then calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the amounts of coins to bet using the function `func_1`. It divides each amount of coins by the GCD to minimize the total amount of coins bet.

Finally, the program checks if the total amount of coins bet is less than the LCM divided by the GCD. If it is, the program prints the amounts of coins to bet for each outcome. Otherwise, it prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
