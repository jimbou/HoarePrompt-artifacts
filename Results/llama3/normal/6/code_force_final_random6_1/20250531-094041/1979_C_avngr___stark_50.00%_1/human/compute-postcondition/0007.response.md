Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers, `hcf` is the greatest common divisor of all integers in the list `numbers`, `num` is the last integer in the list**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `numbers` remains unchanged, but the variable `hcf` now holds the greatest common divisor of all integers in the list `numbers`, and the variable `num` holds the last integer in the list `numbers`.
