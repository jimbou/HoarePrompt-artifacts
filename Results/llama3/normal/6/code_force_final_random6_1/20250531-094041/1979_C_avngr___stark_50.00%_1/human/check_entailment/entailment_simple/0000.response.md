Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of distributing coins in a game such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program first calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all the multipliers, which is the smallest number that is a multiple of all the multipliers. This is done by multiplying all the multipliers together.

Then, for each outcome, the program calculates the amount of coins to bet by dividing the LCM by the multiplier for that outcome. This ensures that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is less than the LCM.

The program then calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the amounts of coins to bet. This is done by calling the function `func_1`, which is not shown in the code snippet, but its functionality is described in the comments. The GCD is used to reduce the amounts of coins to bet while keeping the same ratio between them.

Finally, the program checks if the sum of the reduced amounts of coins to bet is greater than or equal to the LCM divided by the GCD. If it is, the program prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required. Otherwise, the program prints the reduced amounts of coins to bet for each outcome.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the correct output for the given problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
