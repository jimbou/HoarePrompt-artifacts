The code calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the current `hcf` and `num`, and assigns the result back to `hcf`. Since `hcf` is initially the greatest common divisor of the first integer and the second integer in the list `numbers`, and `num` is the third integer in the list, the new value of `hcf` will be the greatest common divisor of the first three integers in the list `numbers`.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `hcf` is the greatest common divisor of the first three integers in the list `numbers`, `num` is the third integer in the list**
