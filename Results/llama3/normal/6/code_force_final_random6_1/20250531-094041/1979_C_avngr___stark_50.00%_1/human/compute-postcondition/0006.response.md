Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 integers, `hcf` is the greatest common divisor of the first four integers in the list `numbers`, `num` is the fourth integer in the list**

In this output state, the value of `hcf` has been updated to be the greatest common divisor of the first four integers in the list `numbers`, which includes the original `hcf` (the greatest common divisor of the first three integers) and the fourth integer `num`. The list `numbers` and the value of `num` remain unchanged.
