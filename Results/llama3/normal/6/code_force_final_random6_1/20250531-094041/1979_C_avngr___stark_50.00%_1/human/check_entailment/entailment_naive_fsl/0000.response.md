Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program is designed to determine how to distribute coins in a game with n possible outcomes, each with a multiplier k_i. The goal is to distribute the coins such that the total amount bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program first calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all the multipliers, which is the smallest number that is a multiple of all the k_i values. It then calculates the amount to bet on each outcome by dividing the LCM by the corresponding multiplier.

The program then checks if the sum of the bets is greater than or equal to the LCM. If it is, it prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required. Otherwise, it prints the bets for each outcome.

The program is correct because it correctly calculates the LCM and the bets for each outcome. It also correctly checks if the sum of the bets is greater than or equal to the LCM, which is the condition for a valid distribution of coins.

The program handles all possible cases, including the case where the sum of the bets is greater than or equal to the LCM, in which case it prints -1. It also handles the case where the sum of the bets is less than the LCM, in which case it prints the bets for each outcome.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
