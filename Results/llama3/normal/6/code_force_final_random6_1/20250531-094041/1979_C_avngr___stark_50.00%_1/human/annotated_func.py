#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers.
    hcf = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        hcf = gcd(hcf, num)
        
    #State: `numbers` is a list of integers, `hcf` is the greatest common divisor of all integers in the list `numbers`, `num` is the last integer in the list
    return hcf
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor of all integers in the list `numbers`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all integers in a given list of numbers. It takes a list of integers as input and returns a single integer value, which is the GCD of all the numbers in the list. The function does not modify the input list.
