To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for num in numbers[1:]:`. This means we're iterating over the list `numbers`, starting from the second element (index 1) to the end of the list.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:

* `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers.
* `hcf` is the greatest common divisor of the first integer and the second integer in the list `numbers`.
* `num` is the second integer in the list.

To execute the loop again, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head. The only objects involved are `num` and `numbers`.

Since we're iterating over the list `numbers` starting from the second element, the next iteration will process the third element in the list (if it exists). Therefore:

* `num` should be the third integer in the list (if it exists).
* `numbers` should still be a list of integers, but we need to ensure it has at least 3 integers for the loop to execute again.

The state of `hcf` is not directly affected by the loop head, so we don't need to adjust it.

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `hcf` is the greatest common divisor of the first integer and the second integer in the list `numbers`, `num` is the third integer in the list**
