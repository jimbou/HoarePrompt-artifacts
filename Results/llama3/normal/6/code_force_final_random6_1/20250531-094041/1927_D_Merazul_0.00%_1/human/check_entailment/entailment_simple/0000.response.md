Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The program is supposed to find two indices i and j (or determine that they do not exist) such that l ≤ i ≤ r, l ≤ j ≤ r, and a_i ≠ a_j for each query. However, the program does not correctly implement this logic.

The program reads the input correctly, but it does not correctly process the queries. It calculates some values (f, m, n) based on the input, but it does not use these values to find the correct indices i and j for each query. Instead, it prints a string ('YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2]) that does not relate to the problem.

The program also does not handle the case where a pair of different elements does not exist for a query. It should print '-1 -1' in this case, but it does not.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
