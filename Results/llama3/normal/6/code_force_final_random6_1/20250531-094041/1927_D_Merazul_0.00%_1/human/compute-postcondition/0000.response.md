Output State: **t is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each test case contains four inputs: first an integer n, then a list of n integers, then an integer q, and finally q lines each containing two integers l and r. The integers n and q are positive integers and 1 <= l < r <= n.**

The code defines a lambda function `R` that reads a line from standard input, splits it into integers, and returns them as a map. Then, it uses this function to read the first input, which is a single integer `t`, representing the number of test cases. The value of `t` is stored in the variable `t`. 

After executing the code, the value of `t` is a positive integer, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each test case contains four inputs: first an integer n, then a list of n integers, then an integer q, and finally q lines each containing two integers l and r. The integers n and q are positive integers and 1 <= l < r <= n.
