Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of four inputs: an integer n, a list of n integers, an integer q, and q lines each containing two integers l and r. It then processes each test case by checking if the intersection of two sets (a and b) is not empty and if the difference between the sizes of the two sets is not negative. If both conditions are met, it prints 'Y', otherwise it prints 'N'. The function continues this process until all test cases have been processed, at which point it terminates, leaving the standard input empty.**
