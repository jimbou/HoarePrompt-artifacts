Output: **t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and t is greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, a is a set of k integers, b is a set containing a single integer q, f is 1 if all i from 1 to k are in a or b, otherwise 0, m is 0 if all i from 1 to k are in a and not in b, otherwise a non-negative integer less than or equal to k // 2, n is 0 if all i from 1 to k are not in a and in b, otherwise a non-negative integer less than or equal to k // 2, k is greater than or equal to 0, i is k, u is True if k is in a, otherwise False, v is True if k is in b, otherwise False, and 'YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2] is printed, where 'YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2] is a string that will be either 'Y' or 'N' or 'E' or 'O' or 'S' depending on the values of f, m, and n**
