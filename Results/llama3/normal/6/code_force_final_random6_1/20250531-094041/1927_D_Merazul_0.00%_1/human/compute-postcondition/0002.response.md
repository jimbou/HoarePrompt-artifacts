Output State: **t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each test case contains three inputs: first a list of n integers, then an integer q, and finally q lines each containing two integers l and r. The integer q is a positive integer and 1 <= l < r <= n. a is a set of n integers, b is a set containing a single integer q, f is 1, m is n which is half of the original value of k.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been decremented by 1. The first input `n` has been removed from stdin, and the list of `n` integers, the integer `q`, and the `q` lines each containing two integers `l` and `r` remain in stdin. The variables `a` and `b` have been assigned the values of the list of `n` integers and the integer `q` respectively. The variable `f` has been assigned the value 1. The variables `m` and `n` have been assigned the value of half of the original value of `k`.
