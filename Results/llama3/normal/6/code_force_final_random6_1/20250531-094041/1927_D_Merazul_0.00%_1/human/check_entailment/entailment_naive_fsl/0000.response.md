Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem. The problem requires finding two indices i and j (or determining that they do not exist) such that l ≤ i ≤ r, l ≤ j ≤ r, and a_i ≠ a_j. However, the program does not correctly implement this logic.

The program uses a set to store the elements of the array a and the queries, and then uses bitwise operations to determine the result. However, this approach is not correct because it does not take into account the actual values of the elements in the array and the queries.

For example, consider the input:

5
1 1 2 1 1
3
1 5
1 2
1 3

The program will output:

2 3
-1 -1
1 3

However, the correct output should be:

2 3
-1 -1
1 3

The program incorrectly outputs -1 -1 for the second query, when in fact the correct output should be 1 2.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
