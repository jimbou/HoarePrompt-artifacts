Reasoning:

The provided Python program does not correctly solve the given problem. The problem requires finding two indices i and j (or determining that they do not exist) such that l ≤ i ≤ r, l ≤ j ≤ r, and a_i ≠ a_j for each query. However, the program does not correctly implement this logic.

The program reads the input correctly, but it does not process the queries as required. It creates two sets a and b from the input, but it does not use these sets to find the required indices i and j. Instead, it checks if the intersection of the two sets is not empty and if the difference between the sizes of the two sets is not negative, which is not relevant to the problem.

Furthermore, the program prints 'Y' or 'N' for each test case, but the problem requires printing two integers i and j (or -1 -1 if such a pair does not exist) for each query.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
