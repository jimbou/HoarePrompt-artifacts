Output: **t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, a is a set of n integers, b is a set containing a single integer q, f is 1 if all i from 1 to k are in a or b, otherwise 0, m is n minus the number of i from 1 to k that are in a and not in b, otherwise n, n is n minus the number of i from 1 to k that are not in a and in b, otherwise n, i is k, k is greater than or equal to 0, u is True if i is in a, otherwise False, v is True if i is in b, otherwise False, and 'YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2] is printed, where 'YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2] is a string that will be either 'Y' or 'N' or 'E' or 'O' or 'S' depending on the values of f, m, and n**
