#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four inputs: first an integer n, then a list of n integers, then an integer q, and finally q lines each containing two integers l and r. The integers n and q are positive integers and 1 <= l < r <= n.
    R = lambda : map(int, input().split())
    t, = R()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        
        *_, k = R()
        
        a = {*R()}
        
        b = {*R()}
        
        f = 1
        
        m = n = k // 2
        
        for i in range(1, k + 1):
            u = i in a
            v = i in b
            f &= u | v
            m -= u & ~v
            n -= ~u & v
        
        print('YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2])
        
    #State: t is 0, stdin contains no test cases, a is a set of k integers, b is a set containing a single integer q, f is 0, m is 0, n is 0, k is greater than or equal to 0, i is k, u is True if k is in a, otherwise False, v is True if k is in b, otherwise False, and 'YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2] is printed for each test case, where 'YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2] is a string that will be either 'Y' or 'N' or 'E' or 'O' or 'S' depending on the values of f, m, and n. Since f is 0, m is 0, and n is 0, 'YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2] will be 'Y' for each test case.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of four inputs: an integer n, a list of n integers, an integer q, and q lines each containing two integers l and r. It then processes each test case by checking if the intersection of two sets (a and b) is not empty and if the difference between the sizes of the two sets is not negative. If both conditions are met, it prints 'Y', otherwise it prints 'N'. The function continues this process until all test cases have been processed, at which point it terminates, leaving the standard input empty.
