The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `n` and is incremented by 2 from its previous value, n is an integer greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 2 and `n` must be greater than `i`. 
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `p` is a list of n integers where every other element starting from the first is n, n-2, n-4, ..., n-2*floor(n/2), and the rest are zeros except for the ith element which is 3 plus the remainder of n divided by 2, `ind` is 5 plus the remainder of n divided by 2, `i` is incremented by 2 from its previous value and is less than `n`, `stdin` is not empty**
