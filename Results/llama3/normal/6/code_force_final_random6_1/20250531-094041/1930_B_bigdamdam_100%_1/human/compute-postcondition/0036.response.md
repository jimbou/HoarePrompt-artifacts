The `print(*p)` statement will print the elements of the list `p`. 

The list `p` contains `n` values. Every other element starting from the first is `n`, `n-2`, `n-4`, ..., `2` or `1`, and the rest are zeros except the even-indexed elements which are `n-1`, `n-3`, `n-5`, ..., `1`. 

Since `n` is at least `0`, the list `p` will have the following structure:

- If `n` is even, the list `p` will be `[n, 0, n-2, 0, ..., 2, 0]`.
- If `n` is odd, the list `p` will be `[n, 0, n-2, 0, ..., 1, 0]`.

The `*` operator in the `print` statement unpacks the list `p` and prints its elements separated by spaces.

Output: **n, 0, n-2, 0, ..., 2, 0 (if n is even) or n, 0, n-2, 0, ..., 1, 0 (if n is odd)**
