The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 2 (because the step is 2) and `n` must be greater than 4.
State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 4, `p` is a list of n integers where the first element is n-2, the third element is n-2, and the rest are zeros, `ind` is n-4, `i` is 4, stdin is empty**
