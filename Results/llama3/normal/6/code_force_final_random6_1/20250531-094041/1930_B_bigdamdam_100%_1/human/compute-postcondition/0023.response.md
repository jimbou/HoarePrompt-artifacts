The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 2 (since the step is 2), so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `p` is a list of n values where the first element is n and the rest are zeros, `ind` is n-2, `i` is 2, stdin is not empty**
