The code snippet consists of three lines. The first line reads a line of input from stdin, splits it into a list of integers, and assigns the first integer to `n`. Since stdin contains at least 1 line of input, this operation is valid. The second line creates a list `p` of `n` zeros. The third line assigns the value of `n` to `ind`.

After the code executes, the state of the variables is as follows:

* `n` is an integer, which is the first integer from the input line.
* `p` is a list of `n` zeros.
* `ind` is equal to `n`.
* `i` is still 0, as it is not modified by the code.
* Stdin is now empty, as the first line of input has been consumed.

Output State: **n is an integer, p is a list of n zeros, ind is equal to n, i is 0, stdin is empty**
