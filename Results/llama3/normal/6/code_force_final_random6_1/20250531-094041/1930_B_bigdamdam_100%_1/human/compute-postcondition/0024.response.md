The first line assigns the value of `ind` to the element at index `i` in the list `p`. Since `i` is 2 and `ind` is `n-2`, the third element of `p` becomes `n-2`. The second line decrements `ind` by 2, making it `n-4`.

Output State: **n is an integer that must be at least 3, p is a list of n values where the first element is n, the third element is n-2, and the rest are zeros, ind is n-4, i is 2, stdin is not empty**
