According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 2 (since the step size is 2), so `i` is 4, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 4.
State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 5, `p` is a list of n values where the first element is n, the third element is n-2, and the rest are zeros, `ind` is n-4, `i` is 4, `stdin` is not empty**
