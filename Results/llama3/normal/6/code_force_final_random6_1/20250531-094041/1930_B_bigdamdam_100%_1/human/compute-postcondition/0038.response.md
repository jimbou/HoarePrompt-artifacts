The only variables in the loop head are variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than the value returned by `int(input())`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1.
State: **`n` is at least 0, `p` is a list of n values where every other element starting from the first is n, n-2, n-4, ..., 2 or 1, and the rest are zeros except the even-indexed elements which are n-1, n-3, n-5, ..., 1, `ind` is n+1 if n is even or n+2 if n is odd, `i` is 2, `stdin` is not empty, and the elements of the list p are being printed**
