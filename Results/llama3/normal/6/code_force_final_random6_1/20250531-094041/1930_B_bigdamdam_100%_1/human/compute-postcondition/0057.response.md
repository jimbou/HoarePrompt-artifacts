Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, p is a list of n integers where every other element starting from the first is n, n-2, n-4, ..., n-2*floor(n/2), and the rest are zeros except for the ith element which is n-1, ind is n+1, i is n, stdin is empty, and the list p is printed.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `n` will be an integer greater than or equal to 3, the list `p` will contain `n` integers where every other element starting from the first will be `n`, `n-2`, `n-4`, ..., `n-2*floor(n/2)`, and the rest will be zeros except for the `i`th element which will be `n-1`. The variable `ind` will be `n+1`, the variable `i` will be `n`, the standard input `stdin` will be empty, and the list `p` will be printed.
