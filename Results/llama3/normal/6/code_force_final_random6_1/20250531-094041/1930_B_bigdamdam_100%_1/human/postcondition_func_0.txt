The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n representing the length of a permutation. It then generates a permutation of length n, where every other element starting from the first is n, n-2, n-4, ..., n-2*floor(n/2), and the rest are zeros except for the ith element which is n-1. The function prints each generated permutation.
