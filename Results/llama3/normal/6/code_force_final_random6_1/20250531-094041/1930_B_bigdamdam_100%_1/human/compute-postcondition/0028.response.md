The value of `ind` is updated to `1 + n % 2`. Since `n` is an integer that must be at least 0, `n % 2` will be either 0 (if `n` is even) or 1 (if `n` is odd). Therefore, `1 + n % 2` will be either 1 (if `n` is even) or 2 (if `n` is odd).

The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 0, `p` is a list of `n` values where every other element starting from the first is `n`, `n-2`, `n-4`, ..., 2 or 1, and the rest are zeros, `ind` is 1 if `n` is even or 2 if `n` is odd, `i` is `n`, stdin is not empty**
