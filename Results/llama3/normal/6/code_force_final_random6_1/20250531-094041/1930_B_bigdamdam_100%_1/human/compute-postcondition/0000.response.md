The only variables in the loop head are variable `i` and the input to `int(input())`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input to `int(input())`. If the input to `int(input())` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains multiple lines of input, so it needs to be adjusted to stdin contains at least 1 line of input and `i` is now 0.
State: **stdin contains at least 1 line of input, `i` is 0**
