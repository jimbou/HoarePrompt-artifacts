Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, p is a list of n integers where every other element starting from the first is n, n-2, n-4, ..., n-2*floor(n/2), and the rest are zeros except for the ith element which is n-1, ind is n+1, i is n, stdin is not empty**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `n` remains unchanged, the list `p` has its even-indexed elements (starting from 0) set to `n`, `n-2`, `n-4`, ..., `n-2*floor(n/2)`, and the rest are zeros except for the last even-indexed element which is set to `n-1`. The value of `ind` is `n+1`, and the value of `i` is `n`. The state of `stdin` remains unchanged, i.e., it is not empty.
