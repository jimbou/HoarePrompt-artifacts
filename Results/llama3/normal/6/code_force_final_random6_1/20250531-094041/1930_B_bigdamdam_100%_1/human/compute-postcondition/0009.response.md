Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 0, `p` is a list of `n` integers where every other element starting from the first is `n-2`, `n-4`, `n-6`, and so on until the last element that is not zero is `n - 2 * floor((n-1)/2)`, and the rest are zeros, `ind` is 1 plus the remainder of `n` divided by 2, `i` is 2 * floor(n/2), stdin is empty**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains the same, which is an integer that must be at least 0. The list `p` also remains the same, with every other element starting from the first being `n-2`, `n-4`, `n-6`, and so on until the last element that is not zero is `n - 2 * floor((n-1)/2)`, and the rest are zeros. The value of `ind` is updated to 1 plus the remainder of `n` divided by 2. The value of `i` remains the same, which is 2 times the floor of `n` divided by 2. The stdin remains empty.
