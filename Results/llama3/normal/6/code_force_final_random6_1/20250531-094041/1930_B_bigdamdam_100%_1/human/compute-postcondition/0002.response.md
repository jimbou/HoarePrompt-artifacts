To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 2 (since the step size is 2). At the start of the loop, `i` should be 0.

State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `p` is a list of n zeros, `ind` is equal to n, `i` is 0, `stdin` is empty**
