To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 2 (since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 2). Before the loop starts, `i` is 2, which is not the starting value of the loop (0), so it needs to be adjusted to 0. `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `p` is a list of n zeros, `ind` is n, `i` is 0, stdin is not empty**
