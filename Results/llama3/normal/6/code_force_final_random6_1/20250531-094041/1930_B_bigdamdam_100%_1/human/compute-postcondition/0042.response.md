The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 2 (because the step is 2), so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `p` is a list of n integers where the first element is n and the rest are zeros, `ind` is n-2, `i` is 2, stdin is not empty**
