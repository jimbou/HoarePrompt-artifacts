Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer that must be at least 0, `p` is a list of `n` values where every other element starting from the first is `n`, `n-2`, `n-4`, ..., 2 or 1, and the rest are zeros, `ind` is 1 if `n` is even or 2 if `n` is odd, `i` is `n`, stdin is not empty
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n, 2):
    p[i] = ind
    ind += 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is at least 3, p is a list of n values where every other element starting from the first is n, n-2, n-4, ..., 2 or 1, and the rest are zeros except the second element which is 1 if n is even or 2 if n is odd, ind is 3 if n is even or 4 if n is odd, i is 1, stdin is not empty

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is at least 3, p is a list of n values where every other element starting from the first is n, n-2, n-4, ..., 2 or 1, and the rest are zeros except the second element which is 1 if n is even or 2 if n is odd, and the fourth element is ind which is 5 if n is even or 6 if n is odd, ind is 5 if n is even or 6 if n is odd, i is 3, stdin is not empty

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is at least 6, p is a list of n values where every other element starting from the first is n, n-2, n-4, ..., 2 or 1, and the rest are zeros except the second element which is 1 if n is even or 2 if n is odd, the fourth element is ind which is 7 if n is even or 8 if n is odd, the sixth element is ind which is 7 if n is even or 8 if n is odd, ind is 7 if n is even or 8 if n is odd, i is 5, stdin is not empty




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
