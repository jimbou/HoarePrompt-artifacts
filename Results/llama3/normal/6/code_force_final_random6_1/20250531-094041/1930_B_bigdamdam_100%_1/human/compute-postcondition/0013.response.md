Output State: **n is an integer that must be at least 5, p is a list of n integers where every other element starting from the first is n-2, n-4, n-6, and so on until the last element that is not zero is n - 2 * floor((n-1)/2), and the rest are zeros except for the element at index 1 which is 1 plus the remainder of n divided by 2, and the element at index 3 which is 5 plus the remainder of n divided by 2, ind is 5 plus the remainder of n divided by 2, i is 3, stdin is empty**
