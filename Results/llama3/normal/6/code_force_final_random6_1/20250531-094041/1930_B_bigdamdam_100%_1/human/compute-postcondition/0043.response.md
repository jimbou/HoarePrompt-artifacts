The code snippet modifies the list `p` and the variable `ind`. The first line assigns the value of `ind` to the `i`-th index of the list `p`. Since `i` is 2, the third element of the list `p` becomes `ind`, which is `n-2`. The second line decrements the value of `ind` by 2.

Output State: **n is an integer greater than 2, p is a list of n integers where the first element is n, the third element is n-2, and the rest are zeros, ind is n-4, i is 2, stdin is not empty**
