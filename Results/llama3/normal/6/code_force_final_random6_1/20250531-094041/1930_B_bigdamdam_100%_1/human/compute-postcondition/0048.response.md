To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 3 (since the range starts from 1 and increments by 2). Before the loop starts, `i` is 2*floor(n/2), which means `i` must be less than `n` for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `p` is a list of `n` integers where every other element starting from the first is `n`, `n-2`, `n-4`, ..., `n-2*floor(n/2)`, and the rest are zeros, `ind` is 1 plus the remainder of `n` divided by 2, `i` is less than `n`, stdin is not empty**
