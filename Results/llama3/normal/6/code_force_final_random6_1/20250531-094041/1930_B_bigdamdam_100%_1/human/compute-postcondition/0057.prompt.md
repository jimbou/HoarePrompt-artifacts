Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3), representing the number of test cases. Each of the following lines contains a single integer n (3 <= n <= 10^5), representing the length of the permutation p.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]
    p = [0] * n
    ind = n
    for i in range(0, n, 2):
        p[i] = ind
        ind -= 2
    ind = 1 + n % 2
    for i in range(1, n, 2):
        p[i] = ind
        ind += 2
    print(*p)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer that must be at least 0, p is a list of n integers where every other element starting from the first is n-2, n-4, n-6, and so on until the last element that is not zero is n - 2 * floor((n-1)/2), and the rest are zeros except for the elements at indices 1, 3, 5, and so on until the last element that is not zero is n - 2 * floor((n-1)/2) which are 1 plus the remainder of n divided by 2, 3 plus the remainder of n divided by 2, 5 plus the remainder of n divided by 2, and so on until the last element that is not zero is n - 2 * floor((n-1)/2) plus the remainder of n divided by 2, ind is n plus the remainder of n divided by 2, i is n, stdin is empty, and the elements of the list p are printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is at least 0, p is a list of n values where every other element starting from the first is n, n-2, n-4, ..., 2 or 1, and the rest are zeros except the even-indexed elements which are n-1, n-3, n-5, ..., 1, ind is n+1 if n is even or n+2 if n is odd, i is 1, stdin is not empty, and the elements of the list p are being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, p is a list of n integers where every other element starting from the first is n, n-2, n-4, ..., n-2*floor(n/2), and the rest are zeros except for the ith element which is n-1, ind is n+1, i is n, stdin is not empty, and the list p is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
