The first line assigns the value of `ind` to the `i`th index of the list `p`. Since `ind` is `n-4` and `i` is 4, the value at the 4th index of `p` becomes `n-4`. The second line decrements `ind` by 2, making it `n-6`.

Output State: **n is an integer that must be at least 5, p is a list of n values where the first element is n, the third element is n-2, the fourth element is n-4, and the rest are zeros, ind is n-6, i is 4, stdin is not empty**
