Postcondition: ***n, k are integers, l is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: two integers and a list of integers. If the first element in the list ele is less than 0 and its absolute value is greater than or equal to c, then c is 0 and maxi is the maximum of its original value and c. Otherwise, c is updated to the sum of its original value and ele, and maxi is updated to the maximum of its original value and the sum of its original value and ele, and i remains 0.***
