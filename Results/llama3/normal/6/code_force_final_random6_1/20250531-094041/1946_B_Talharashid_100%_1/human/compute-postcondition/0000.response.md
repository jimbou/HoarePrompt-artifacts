To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the input, as it is the only object in the loop head. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input. If the input has at least 1 test case, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains multiple test cases, but this does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to stdin contains at least 1 test case and i is now 0.

State: **stdin contains at least 1 test case, i is 0**
