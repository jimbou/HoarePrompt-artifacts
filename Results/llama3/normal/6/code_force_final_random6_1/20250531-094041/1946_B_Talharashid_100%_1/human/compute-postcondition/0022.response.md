The only objects in the loop head are variables  ele and list  l, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list l.  If the list has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, c is 0, maxi is 0, i is 1, stdin contains 0 inputs: no inputs, and the result of the expression (2*maxi + c) is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 element and the ele is the first element in the list.
State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, c is 0, maxi is 0, i is 1, stdin contains 0 inputs: no inputs, the result of the expression (2*maxi + c) is 0, ele is the first element in the list**
