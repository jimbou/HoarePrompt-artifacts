Postcondition: **n is an integer, k is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, i is 1, stdin contains 0 inputs: no inputs, ele is the second element in the list. If ele is negative and its absolute value is greater than or equal to c, then maxi is the maximum of c and maxi, and c is 0. Otherwise, c is incremented by the value of ele, and maxi is the maximum value between the new value of c and its previous value.**
