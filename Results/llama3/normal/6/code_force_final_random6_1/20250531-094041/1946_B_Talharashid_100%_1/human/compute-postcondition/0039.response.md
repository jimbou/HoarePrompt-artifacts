Output: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is an empty list, `c` is 0, `maxi` is the maximum value between the original `maxi` and 0, `i` is 1, stdin contains 0 inputs: no inputs, and this is printed: (2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007 which is equal to (2 ** k * maxi - maxi + 0) % 1000000007 which is equal to (2 ** k * maxi - maxi) % 1000000007**
