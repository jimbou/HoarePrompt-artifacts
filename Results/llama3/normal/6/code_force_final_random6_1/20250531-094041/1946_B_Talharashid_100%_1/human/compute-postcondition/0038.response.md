To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the components involved based on the initial state provided:

1. `n` and `k` are integers, but their specific values are not provided. However, their values do not directly affect the calculation in the print statement.
2. `l` is an empty list. The sum of an empty list is 0.
3. `c` is 0, but it is not used in the print statement.
4. `maxi` is the maximum value between the original `maxi` and 0. Since the original value of `maxi` is not specified, we can only say that `maxi` will be 0 or greater, depending on its original value. However, without a specific original value for `maxi`, we cannot determine its exact value after this operation. Given the context, it seems likely that `maxi` would be at least 0, but without more information, we cannot assume a specific value.
5. `i` is 1, but it is not used in the print statement.
6. The expression `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` involves several operations:
   - `2 ** k` calculates 2 to the power of `k`. Without knowing `k`, we cannot calculate this exactly.
   - `maxi` is involved in two subtractions/additions, but without its value, we cannot simplify this part.
   - `sum(l)` is 0 because `l` is an empty list.
   - The entire expression is then taken modulo 1000000007.

Given these considerations, the output cannot be precisely calculated without knowing the values of `k` and `maxi`. However, we can describe the operation that will be performed:

The code will print the result of the expression `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`, which simplifies to `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi) % 1000000007` since `sum(l)` is 0. This expression involves calculating 2 to the power of `k`, multiplying it by `maxi`, subtracting `maxi`, and then taking the result modulo 1000000007.

Output: **((2^k * maxi - maxi) % 1000000007) (where k is the value of k and maxi is the maximum value between the original maxi and 0)**
