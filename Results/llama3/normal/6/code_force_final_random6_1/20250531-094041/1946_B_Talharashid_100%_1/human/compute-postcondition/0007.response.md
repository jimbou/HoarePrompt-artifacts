Postcondition: ***`n`, `k` are integers, `l` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: two integers and a list of integers. If the first element in the list `ele` is less than 0 and its absolute value is greater than or equal to `c`, then `c` remains 0, `maxi` remains 0, and `i` remains 0. Otherwise, `c` is updated to the sum of its original value and `ele`, `maxi` is updated to the maximum of its original value and the sum of its original value and `ele`, and `i` remains 0.***
