This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains n integers. It calculates the maximum sum of all positive subsequences in the list, then prints the result of the expression (2^k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007 for each test case, where maxi is the maximum sum of all positive subsequences. The function processes all test cases in stdin and leaves stdin empty.
