The code prints the result of the expression `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`.

Here's a breakdown of the variables and their values:

*   `k` is an integer.
*   `maxi` is the maximum of 0 and the maximum sum of all positive subsequences in the list `l`.
*   `l` is a list.
*   `sum(l)` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`.

Since the exact values of `k`, `l`, and `maxi` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the result of the expression modulo 1000000007.

Output: **(2^k \* maxi - maxi + sum of all elements in list l) % 1000000007 (where k is the value of k, maxi is the maximum of 0 and the maximum sum of all positive subsequences in list l, and sum of all elements in list l is the sum of all elements in list l)**
