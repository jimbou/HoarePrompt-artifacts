Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains 0 inputs: no inputs, `ele` is the third element in the list. If `ele` is negative and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and `maxi`, and `c` is 0. Otherwise, `c` is increased by the value of `ele`, and `maxi` is the maximum value between the updated `c` and the original `maxi`.***
