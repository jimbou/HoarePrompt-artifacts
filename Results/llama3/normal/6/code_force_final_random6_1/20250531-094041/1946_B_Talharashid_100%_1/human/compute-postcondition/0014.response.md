Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, l is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: two integers and a list of integers, ele is the second element in the list l, c is the sum of its original value and the previous ele, maxi is the maximum of its original value and the updated c, and i is 0.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `l`, `stdin`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet. The value of `ele` is still the second element in the list `l`. The value of `c` is updated to be the sum of its original value and the previous value of `ele`. The value of `maxi` is updated to be the maximum of its original value and the updated value of `c`.
