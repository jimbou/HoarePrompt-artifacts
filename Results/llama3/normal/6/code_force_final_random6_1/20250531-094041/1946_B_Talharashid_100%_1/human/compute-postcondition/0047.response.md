Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 2, `stdin` is empty, `ele` is the first element in the list. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `maxi` is set to the maximum of its original value and the absolute value of `ele`, and `c` remains 0. Otherwise, `c` is increased by `ele`, and `maxi` is set to the maximum of `c` and its original value.***
