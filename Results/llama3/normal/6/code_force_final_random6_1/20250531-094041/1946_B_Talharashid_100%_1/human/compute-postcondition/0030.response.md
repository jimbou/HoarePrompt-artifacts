Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, i is 1, stdin contains 0 inputs: no inputs, ele is the second element in the list, c is incremented by the value of ele, maxi is the maximum value between the new value of c and its previous value**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `l`, `i`, and `stdin` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet. The value of `ele` also remains the same as it is not modified by the code. The value of `c` is incremented by the value of `ele`, and the value of `maxi` is updated to be the maximum value between the new value of `c` and its previous value.
