Output: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `c` is 0, `maxi` is the maximum of the maximum sum of all positive subarrays in `l` and 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: two integers and a list of integers, and this is printed: the result of the expression (2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007, which is a number between 0 and 1000000006 (inclusive), representing the result of the given mathematical operation modulo 1000000007**
