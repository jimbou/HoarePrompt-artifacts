To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `ele` and `l`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `ele` is the second element in the list `l`, and `l` must have at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute again, `l` must have at least 3 elements, and `ele` should be the third element in the list.

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains 0 inputs: no inputs, `ele` is the third element in the list**
