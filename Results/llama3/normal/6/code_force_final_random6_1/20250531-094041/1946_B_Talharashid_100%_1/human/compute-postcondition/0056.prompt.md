Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, l is an empty list, c is 0, maxi is 0, i is 2, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for ele in l:
    if ele < 0 and c <= abs(ele):
        maxi = max(c, maxi)
        c = 0
    else:
        c += ele
        maxi = max(c, maxi)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 2, `stdin` is empty, `ele` is the first element in the list. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `maxi` is set to the maximum of its original value and the absolute value of `ele`, and `c` remains 0. Otherwise, `c` is increased by `ele`, and `maxi` is set to the maximum of `c` and its original value.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `stdin` is empty, `ele` is the second element in the list. If `ele` is negative and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `maxi` is the maximum of its original value and `c`, and `c` is 0. Otherwise, `c` is increased by the value of the second element in the list, and `maxi` is the maximum value between the updated `c` and its original value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `stdin` is empty, `ele` is the third element in the list. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `maxi` is the maximum of its original value and `c`, and `c` is 0. Otherwise, `c` is increased by the value of `ele`, and `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and `maxi`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
