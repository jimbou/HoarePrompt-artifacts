Postcondition: ***n is an integer, k is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, i is 1, stdin contains 0 inputs: no inputs. If the first element in the list is less than 0 and the original value of c is less than or equal to the absolute value of the first element, then c remains 0 and maxi remains 0. Otherwise, c is updated to the sum of its original value and the first element in the list, and maxi is updated to the maximum of its original value and the updated c. The result of the expression (2*maxi + c) is not necessarily 0.***
