Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `stdin` is empty, `ele` is the second element in the list. If `ele` is negative and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `maxi` is the maximum of its original value and `c`, and `c` is 0. Otherwise, `c` is increased by the value of the second element in the list, and `maxi` is the maximum value between the updated `c` and its original value.***
