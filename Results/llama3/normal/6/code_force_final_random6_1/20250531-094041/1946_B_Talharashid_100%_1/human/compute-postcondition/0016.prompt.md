Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, l is a list of integers, c is 0, maxi is 0, i is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: two integers and a list of integers
Code of the loop:
for ele in l:
    if ele < 0 and c <= abs(ele):
        maxi = max(c, maxi)
        c = 0
    else:
        c += ele
        maxi = max(c, maxi)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n`, `k` are integers, `l` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: two integers and a list of integers. If the first element in the list `ele` is less than 0 and its absolute value is greater than or equal to `c`, then `c` remains 0, `maxi` remains 0, and `i` remains 0. Otherwise, `c` is updated to the sum of its original value and `ele`, `maxi` is updated to the maximum of its original value and the sum of its original value and `ele`, and `i` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n, k are integers, l is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: two integers and a list of integers. If the first element in the list ele is less than 0 and its absolute value is greater than or equal to c, then c is 0 and maxi is the maximum of its original value and c. Otherwise, c is updated to the sum of its original value and ele, and maxi is updated to the maximum of its original value and the sum of its original value and ele, and i remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n and k are integers, l is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: two integers and a list of integers, ele is the second element in the list l. If ele is less than 0 and c is less than or equal to the absolute value of ele, then c is 0. Otherwise, c is the sum of its original value and the previous ele. In both cases, maxi is the maximum of its original value and c, and i is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
