Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, l is a list of integers, c is 0, maxi is 0, i is 1, stdin contains 0 inputs: no inputs, and the result of the expression (2
Code of the loop:
for ele in l:
    if ele < 0 and c <= abs(ele):
        maxi = max(c, maxi)
        c = 0
    else:
        c += ele
        maxi = max(c, maxi)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer, k is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, i is 1, stdin contains 0 inputs: no inputs. If the first element in the list is less than 0 and the original value of c is less than or equal to the absolute value of the first element, then c remains 0 and maxi remains 0. Otherwise, c is updated to the sum of its original value and the first element in the list, and maxi is updated to the maximum of its original value and the updated c. The result of the expression (2*maxi + c) is not necessarily 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer, k is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, i is 1, stdin contains 0 inputs: no inputs, ele is the second element in the list. If ele is negative and its absolute value is greater than or equal to c, then maxi is the maximum of c and maxi, and c is 0. Otherwise, c is incremented by the value of ele, and maxi is the maximum value between the new value of c and its previous value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains 0 inputs: no inputs, `ele` is the third element in the list. If `ele` is negative and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and `maxi`, and `c` is 0. Otherwise, `c` is increased by the value of `ele`, and `maxi` is the maximum value between the updated `c` and the original `maxi`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
