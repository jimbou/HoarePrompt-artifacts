According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `l`. If the list has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, and `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: two integers and a list of integers. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 element and the element is the first element in the list.
State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: two integers and a list of integers, `ele` is the first element in the list**
