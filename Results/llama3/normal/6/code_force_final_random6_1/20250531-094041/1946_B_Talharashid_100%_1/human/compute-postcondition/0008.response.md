The only object in the loop head is variable  ele and list  l, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list l.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, list l has at least 1 element, ele is the first element in the list, i is 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the ele is the second element in the list.
State: **`n`, `k` are integers, `l` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: two integers and a list of integers. If the first element in the list `ele` is less than 0 and its absolute value is greater than or equal to `c`, then `c` remains 0, `maxi` remains 0, and `i` remains 0. Otherwise, `c` is updated to the sum of its original value and `ele`, `maxi` is updated to the maximum of its original value and the sum of its original value and `ele`, and `i` remains 0.**
