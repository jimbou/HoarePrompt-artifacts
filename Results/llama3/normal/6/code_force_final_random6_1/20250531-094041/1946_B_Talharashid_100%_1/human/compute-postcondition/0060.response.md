Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list, `c` is 0, `maxi` is the maximum of 0 and the maximum sum of all positive subsequences in the list, `i` is the number of test cases in stdin, stdin is empty, and this is printed: the result of the expression `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` for each test case.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has processed all the test cases in the input, and for each test case, it has calculated and printed the result of the given expression. The loop variables `n`, `k`, `l`, `c`, and `maxi` have been updated accordingly for each test case, and the input has been fully consumed.
