Postcondition: ***n and k are integers, l is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: two integers and a list of integers, ele is the second element in the list l. If ele is less than 0 and c is less than or equal to the absolute value of ele, then c is 0. Otherwise, c is the sum of its original value and the previous ele. In both cases, maxi is the maximum of its original value and c, and i is 0.***
