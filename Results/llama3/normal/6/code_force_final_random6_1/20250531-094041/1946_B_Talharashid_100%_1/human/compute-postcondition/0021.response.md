Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, l is a list of integers, c is 0, maxi is 0, i is 1, stdin contains 0 inputs: no inputs, and the result of the expression (2**k) is printed.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `l`, `c`, `maxi`, and `i` are updated according to the code. The `n` and `k` variables are assigned integer values from the input, `l` is assigned a list of integers from the input, `c` and `maxi` are initialized to 0, and `i` remains unchanged at 1. The stdin is now empty since all inputs have been consumed. Additionally, the result of the expression `(2**k)` is printed, but its value is not stored in any variable.
