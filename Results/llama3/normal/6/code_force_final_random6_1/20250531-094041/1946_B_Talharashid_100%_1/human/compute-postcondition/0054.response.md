Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, l is a list that must have at least 3 elements, i is 2, stdin is empty, ele is the third element in the list, c is increased by the value of ele, maxi is the maximum value between c and maxi**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `l`, `i`, and `stdin` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The value of `ele` is still the third element in the list `l`. The variable `c` has been incremented by the value of `ele`, and the variable `maxi` has been updated to be the maximum value between the new value of `c` and its previous value.
