Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, l is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: two integers and a list of integers, ele is the second element in the list l, c is 0, maxi is the maximum of its original value and the previous c, and i is 0**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line updates the value of `maxi` to be the maximum of its original value and the current value of `c`. Since `c` is either 0 or the sum of its original value and the previous `ele`, the new value of `maxi` will be the maximum of its original value and this updated value of `c`. The second line resets the value of `c` to 0. 

The values of `n`, `k`, `l`, `stdin`, `ele`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet.
