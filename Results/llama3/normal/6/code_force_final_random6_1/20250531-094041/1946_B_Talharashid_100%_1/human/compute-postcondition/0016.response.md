Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, l is a list of integers, c is 0, maxi is the maximum sum of all positive subarrays in l, i is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: two integers and a list of integers.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the values of n, k, l, and stdin remain unchanged. The variable c is reset to 0, and maxi is updated to the maximum sum of all positive subarrays in the list l. The variable i remains 0.
