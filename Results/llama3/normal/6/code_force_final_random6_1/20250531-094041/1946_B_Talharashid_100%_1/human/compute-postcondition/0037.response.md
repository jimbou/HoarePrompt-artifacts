Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is an empty list, `c` is 0, `maxi` is the maximum value between the original `maxi` and 0, `i` is 1, stdin contains 0 inputs: no inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `maxi` has been updated to be the maximum value between its original value and 0, since `c` is 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
