Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, c is 0, maxi is 0, i is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: two integers and a list of integers, ele is the first element in the list, the current value of ele is less than 0, and the absolute value of ele is greater than or equal to 0.**

The code block consists of two lines. The first line assigns the maximum value between `c` and `maxi` to `maxi`. Since `c` is 0 and `maxi` is also 0, `maxi` remains 0. The second line assigns 0 to `c`, which does not change its value since it was already 0. No other variables are affected by the code block.
