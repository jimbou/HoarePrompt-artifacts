The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the input from stdin. If `i` is less than the number of test cases, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: two integers and a list of integers. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and stdin must contain at least 1 test case minus 1 inputs: two integers and a list of integers.
State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `c` is 0, `maxi` is the maximum of the maximum sum of all positive subarrays in `l` and 0, `i` is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 1 inputs: two integers and a list of integers, and this is printed: the result of the expression (2**n + 12*k + sum(l))**2**
