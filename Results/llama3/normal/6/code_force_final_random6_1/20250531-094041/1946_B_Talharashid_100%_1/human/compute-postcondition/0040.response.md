To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(int(input())):`. The objects involved in the loop head are `i` and the input from `stdin`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `stdin` contains 0 inputs (no inputs). To execute the loop again, we need to adjust the state of `i` and the input from `stdin`.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, we can set `i` to 2 for the next iteration.

Regarding the input from `stdin`, since it contains 0 inputs, we need to provide at least one input for the loop to execute again. Let's assume the input is a single integer value, which will be used to determine the range of the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is an empty list, `c` is 0, `maxi` is the maximum value between the original `maxi` and 0, `i` is 2, stdin contains 1 input: a single integer value**
