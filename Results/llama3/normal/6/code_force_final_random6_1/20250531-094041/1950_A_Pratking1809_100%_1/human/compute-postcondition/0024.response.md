Postcondition: ***`q` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers between 0 and 9, stdin contains at least `q-3` lines, each containing three digits. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, then 'STAIR' is printed. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than or equal to `c`, then 'PEAK' is printed. Otherwise, 'NONE' is printed.***
