Output State: **`q` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers between 0 and 9, `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned the values of the first three digits from the input, stdin contains at least `q-5` lines, each containing three digits. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, then 'STAIR' is printed. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than or equal to `c`, then 'PEAK' is printed. Otherwise, 'NONE' is printed.**

In this output state, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` have been updated to the first three digits from the input, and the stdin now contains at least `q-5` lines, each containing three digits. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
