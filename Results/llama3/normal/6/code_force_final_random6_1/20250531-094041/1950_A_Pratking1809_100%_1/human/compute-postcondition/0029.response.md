Based on the precondition, the code will print 'PEAK' regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. The reason is that the print statement is a simple `print('PEAK')` without any conditional statements or variables involved.

The precondition describes the state of the program, including the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, but these values do not affect the output of the print statement. The print statement is a direct instruction to print the string 'PEAK', and it will do so regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **PEAK**
