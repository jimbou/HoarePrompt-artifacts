Reasoning:

1. The problem requires determining whether three given digits form a stair, a peak, or neither. A stair is defined as a sequence where a < b < c, and a peak is defined as a sequence where a < b > c.

2. The provided Python program defines a function `func()` that reads the number of test cases `q` and then iterates over each test case.

3. For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` and checks the conditions for a stair and a peak.

4. If the condition for a stair (a < b < c) is met, it prints 'STAIR'.

5. If the condition for a peak (a < b > c) is met, it prints 'PEAK'.

6. If neither condition is met, it prints 'NONE'.

7. The program correctly implements the logic for determining whether the digits form a stair, a peak, or neither, based on the given conditions.

8. The program handles all possible cases, including when the digits are equal, which would result in 'NONE' being printed.

Correctness: **True**
