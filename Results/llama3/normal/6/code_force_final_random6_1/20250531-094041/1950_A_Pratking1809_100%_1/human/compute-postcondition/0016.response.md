Output State: **`q` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers between 0 and 9, stdin contains at least `q-3` lines, each containing three digits. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, then 'STAIR' is printed. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`, then 'PEAK' is printed. Otherwise, 'NONE' is printed.**

In this output state, the values of `q` and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to the three integers read from the first line of the input, which contains three digits. The stdin now contains at least `q-3` lines, each containing three digits, since one line has been read. The conditions for printing 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' remain the same, but the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` have been updated.
