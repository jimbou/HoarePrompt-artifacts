To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `arr[i]` and `arr[i + 1]`.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `i` is less than or equal to `j` and `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`, and `i` is incremented by 1.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to make sure that `arr[i]` is still equal to `arr[i + 1]` after the increment of `i`. This means that `arr[i + 1]` must be equal to `arr[i + 2]`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`i` is equal to `j` if all elements in `arr` are equal, otherwise `i` is less than `j` and `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]` and `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[j]`. Additionally, `i` is less than or equal to `j` and `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`, and `arr[i + 1]` is equal to `arr[i + 2]`.**
