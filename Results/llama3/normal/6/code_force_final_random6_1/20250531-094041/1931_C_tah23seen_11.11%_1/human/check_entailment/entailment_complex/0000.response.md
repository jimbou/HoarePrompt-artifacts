Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the minimum number of burles (operations) needed to make all elements of the array equal. However, the function does not correctly implement this logic.

The function first checks if all elements in the array are equal by comparing elements from the start and end of the array and moving towards the center. If all elements are equal, it correctly returns 0.

However, if not all elements are equal, the function then checks if the first element is equal to the next element and moves forward until it finds a different element. This is not relevant to the problem of making all elements equal.

The function then returns the difference between `j` and `i` plus 1, but this value does not represent the minimum number of burles needed to make all elements equal. In fact, the function returns 1 when `j` is not equal to the last index of the array, which is incorrect.

The correct approach would be to count the number of distinct elements in the array and subtract 1, because we can make all elements equal by replacing all elements with one of the distinct elements.

Correctness: **False**
