Postcondition: ***`arr` has at least one element. If the first element of `arr` is equal to the last element of `arr`, then `i` is 1 and `j` is the second last index of `arr`. Otherwise, the first element of `arr` is not equal to the last element of `arr`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, with `i` remaining 0 and `j` remaining the last index of `arr`.***
