Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: arr is a list of integers, i is 0, j is the last index of arr
Code of the loop:
while i <= j:
    if arr[i] == arr[j]:
        i += 1
        j -= 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`arr` has at least one element. If the first element of `arr` is equal to the last element of `arr`, then `i` is 1 and `j` is the second last index of `arr`. Otherwise, the first element of `arr` is not equal to the last element of `arr`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, with `i` remaining 0 and `j` remaining the last index of `arr`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`arr` has at least one element. If the first element of `arr` is equal to the last element of `arr`, then `i` is 1 and `j` is the second last index of `arr`. Otherwise, `i` is 0 and `j` is the last index of `arr` minus 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `arr` has at least one element. If the first element of `arr` is equal to the last element of `arr`, then either `i` is at least 2 and `j` is at least 0, or `i` is 1 and `j` is at least 1. Otherwise, either `i` is at least 1 and `j` is at least -1, or `i` is 0 and `j` is at least 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
