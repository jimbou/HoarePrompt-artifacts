Output State: **`arr` has at least one element. If the first element of `arr` is equal to the last element of `arr`, then `i` is 1 and `j` is at least 1. Otherwise, `i` is 0 and `j` is at least 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the additional information that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of `arr`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged, and the relationship between the first and last elements of `arr` and the values of `i` and `j` is still valid.
