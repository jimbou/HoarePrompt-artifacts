According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `i` is less than or equal to `j`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, there are two possible scenarios:

1. The first element of `arr` is equal to the last element of `arr`, then `i` is 1 and `j` is the second last index of `arr`. In this case, `i` is less than `j`, so the loop can execute again without any adjustments.
2. The first element of `arr` is not equal to the last element of `arr`, then `i` is 0 and `j` is the last index of `arr`. In this case, `i` is less than `j`, so the loop can execute again without any adjustments.

In both scenarios, the loop can execute again without any adjustments to the states of `i` and `j`. Therefore, the state remains the same.

State: **`arr` has at least one element. If the first element of `arr` is equal to the last element of `arr`, then `i` is 1 and `j` is the second last index of `arr`. Otherwise, the first element of `arr` is not equal to the last element of `arr`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, with `i` remaining 0 and `j` remaining the last index of `arr`.**
