To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `i <= j`. The loop will execute if this condition is true.

Given the state right before the loop:

- `arr` is a list of integers
- `i` is 0
- `j` is the last index of `arr`

Since `i` is 0, for the condition `i <= j` to be true, `j` must be greater than or equal to 0. However, since `j` is defined as the last index of `arr`, and given that indexing in most programming languages starts at 0, `j` being the last index implies that `arr` must have at least one element. If `arr` were empty, `j` would be -1 (since the last index of an empty list is considered -1 in many contexts), which would not satisfy the condition `i <= j` when `i` is 0.

Therefore, the state that needs adjustment is the length of `arr`. It must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`arr` must have at least one element, `i` is 0, `j` is the last index of `arr`**
