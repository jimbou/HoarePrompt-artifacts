Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, consider the input array [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]. The program will return 7, but the correct answer is 6. The program is not correctly calculating the minimum number of burles needed to make all elements of the array equal.

The issue with the program is that it only checks for the first and last occurrences of each number in the array, and then calculates the difference between the indices. However, this approach does not consider the case where there are multiple occurrences of the same number in the middle of the array.

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to correctly calculate the minimum number of burles needed to make all elements of the array equal. One possible approach is to use a dynamic programming algorithm to find the longest contiguous subarray with the same element, and then calculate the minimum number of burles needed to make all elements of the array equal.
