Output State: **`i` is equal to `j`, `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`, `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[j]`, `i` is equal to `j`, `arr[i + 1]` is equal to `arr[i + 2]`, and `i` is incremented by 1**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now equal to `j`. The equalities between the elements of the array `arr` are still valid, as the increment of `i` does not affect these relationships.
