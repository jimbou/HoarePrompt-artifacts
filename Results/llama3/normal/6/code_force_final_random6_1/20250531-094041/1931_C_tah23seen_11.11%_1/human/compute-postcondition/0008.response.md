Output State: **i is 1 or 0 depending on whether the first element of arr is equal to the last element of arr, j is the second last index of arr if the first element of arr is equal to the last element of arr, otherwise j is the last index of arr minus 1.**

The code increments `i` by 1 and decrements `j` by 1. If the first element of `arr` is equal to the last element of `arr`, then `i` was initially 1 and becomes 2, and `j` was initially the second last index of `arr` and becomes the third last index of `arr`. If the first element of `arr` is not equal to the last element of `arr`, then `i` was initially 0 and becomes 1, and `j` was initially the last index of `arr` and becomes the second last index of `arr`. The state of `arr` remains unchanged.
