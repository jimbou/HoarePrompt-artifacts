To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `arr[i]` and `arr[i + 1]`.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`. At the end of the last iteration, `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`, and `arr[i]` is also equal to `arr[j]`. Additionally, `i` is incremented by 1.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to maintain the equality between `arr[i]` and `arr[i + 1]`. Since `i` is incremented by 1, we need to adjust the state of `arr[i + 1]` to be equal to `arr[i + 2]`.

State: **`i` is less than `j`, `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`, `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[j]`, `i` is less than or equal to `j`, `arr[i + 1]` is equal to `arr[i + 2]`, and `i` is incremented by 1**
