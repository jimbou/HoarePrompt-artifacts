Output State: **`i` is equal to `j` if all elements in `arr` are equal, otherwise `i` is less than `j` and `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]` and `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[j]`. Additionally, `i` is less than or equal to `j` and `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`, and `i` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language, the output state means that the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, but the relationship between `i` and `j` and the equality of elements in the array `arr` remains the same as in the initial state. The only change is that `i` has moved one step forward, but its relationship with `j` and the elements of `arr` is still maintained.
