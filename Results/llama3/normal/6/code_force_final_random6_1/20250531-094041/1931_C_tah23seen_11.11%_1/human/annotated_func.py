#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines the length of the longest contiguous subarray with equal elements in a given list of integers. It returns 0 if all elements in the list are equal, 1 if the list contains a single unique element at the end, and the length of the longest contiguous subarray with equal elements otherwise.
