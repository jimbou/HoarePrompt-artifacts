Output State: **`arr` has at least one element. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement, with `i` remaining 0 and `j` remaining the last index of `arr`.**

In this output state, the code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is 0, and the value of `j` is the last index of `arr`. The array `arr` still has at least one element.
