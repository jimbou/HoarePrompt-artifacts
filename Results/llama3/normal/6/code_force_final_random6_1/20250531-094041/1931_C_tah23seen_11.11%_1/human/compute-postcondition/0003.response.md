Output State: **i is 1, j is the second last index of arr, arr[i] is not necessarily equal to arr[j].**

In this output state, the value of `i` is incremented by 1, and the value of `j` is decremented by 1. The relationship between `arr[i]` and `arr[j]` is no longer guaranteed to be equal, as the indices have changed. All other information from the precondition remains valid, including the fact that `arr` must have at least one element.
