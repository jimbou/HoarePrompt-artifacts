Output State: **`i` is equal to `j` if all elements in `arr` are equal, otherwise `i` is less than `j` and `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[j]`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop finishes executing, either all elements in the array `arr` are equal, in which case `i` and `j` will meet in the middle, or there will be a pair of elements at indices `i` and `j` that are not equal, at which point the loop will exit.
