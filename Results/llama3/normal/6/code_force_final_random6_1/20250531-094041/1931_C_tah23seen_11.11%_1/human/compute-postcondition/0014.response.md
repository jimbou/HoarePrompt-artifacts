Postcondition: **`arr` has at least one element. If the first element of `arr` is equal to the last element of `arr`, then either `i` is at least 2 and `j` is at least 0, or `i` is 1 and `j` is at least 1. Otherwise, either `i` is at least 1 and `j` is at least -1, or `i` is 0 and `j` is at least 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
