Output State: **`i` is equal to `j` and `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[j]`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `i` is equal to `j` and the elements at indices `i` and `j` in the array `arr` are equal. This means that the loop has iterated until it found a pair of equal elements in the array, and the values of `i` and `j` are now equal to each other and to the index of the equal elements.
