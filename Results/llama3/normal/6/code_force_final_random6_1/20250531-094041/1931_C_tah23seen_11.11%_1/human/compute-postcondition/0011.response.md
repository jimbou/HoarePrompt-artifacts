The variables in the loop head are `i` and `j`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `i` is less than or equal to `j`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 0 or 1, and `j` is either the second last index of `arr` or the last index of `arr` minus 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than or equal to `j`. If `i` is 0, then `j` can be any index greater than or equal to 0. If `i` is 1, then `j` must be at least 1. Therefore, the state of `j` needs to be adjusted to be at least 1.

State: **`arr` has at least one element. If the first element of `arr` is equal to the last element of `arr`, then `i` is 1 and `j` is at least 1. Otherwise, `i` is 0 and `j` is at least 0**
