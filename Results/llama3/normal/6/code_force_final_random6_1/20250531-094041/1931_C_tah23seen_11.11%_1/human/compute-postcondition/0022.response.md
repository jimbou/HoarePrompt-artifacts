Output State: **`i` is less than `j` and `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]` and `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[j]`. Additionally, `i` is less than or equal to `j` and `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`, and `arr[i + 1]` is equal to `arr[i + 2]`, and `i` is incremented by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, but the relationship between `i` and `j` remains the same. The conditions that `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]` and `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[j]` still hold, as well as the condition that `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]` and `arr[i + 1]` is equal to `arr[i + 2]`. The increment of `i` does not affect the relationships between the elements of the array.
