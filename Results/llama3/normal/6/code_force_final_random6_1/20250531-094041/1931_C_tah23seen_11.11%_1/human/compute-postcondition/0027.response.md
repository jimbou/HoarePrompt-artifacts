Output State: **The program returns the difference between `j` and `i` plus 1, where `i` is equal to `j` and `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[j]`. Since `i` is equal to `j`, the difference between `j` and `i` is 0, so the program returns 0 + 1, which is 1.**

In simpler terms, the program returns 1, because `i` and `j` are equal, and the difference between them is 0, and adding 1 to that result gives 1.
