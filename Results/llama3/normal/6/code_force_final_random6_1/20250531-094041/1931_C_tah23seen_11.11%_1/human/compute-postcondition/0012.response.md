Output State: **arr has at least one element. If the first element of arr is equal to the last element of arr, then i is at least 2 and j is at least 0. Otherwise, i is at least 1 and j is at least -1.**

The code increments `i` by 1 and decrements `j` by 1. If the first element of `arr` is equal to the last element of `arr`, then `i` was initially 1 and `j` was at least 1. After the code executes, `i` becomes at least 2 and `j` becomes at least 0. If the first element of `arr` is not equal to the last element of `arr`, then `i` was initially 0 and `j` was at least 0. After the code executes, `i` becomes at least 1 and `j` becomes at least -1. The value of `arr` remains unchanged.
