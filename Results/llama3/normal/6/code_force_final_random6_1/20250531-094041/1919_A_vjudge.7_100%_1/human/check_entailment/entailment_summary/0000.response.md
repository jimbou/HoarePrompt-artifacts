Reasoning:
The given program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. The program uses the bitwise AND operator (&) to check if the sum of the coins is even or odd. If the sum is even, it prints 'Bob', and if the sum is odd, it prints 'Alice'. This is consistent with the problem description, which states that the player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible inputs.

Correctness: **True**
