To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `t` and `test`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `test`. If `test` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `test` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), which already ensures that the loop will execute. However, we need to adjust the state of `t` to reflect that it will start from 0.

State: **`test` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains `test` lines, each containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9), `t` is 0**
