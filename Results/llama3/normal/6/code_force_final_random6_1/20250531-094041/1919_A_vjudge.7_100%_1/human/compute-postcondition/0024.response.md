Output State: **`test` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `t` is `test-1`, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) and are the values of the last line of the stdin, stdin contains 0 lines, and either 'Bob' or 'Alice' is being printed depending on whether the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations means that the loop has finished executing, and the variables `t`, `a`, and `b` have reached their final values. The value of `t` is now `test-1`, indicating that the loop has executed `test` times. The values of `a` and `b` are the values of the last line of the stdin, which is now empty since all lines have been processed. The output is either 'Bob' or 'Alice', depending on whether the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd.
