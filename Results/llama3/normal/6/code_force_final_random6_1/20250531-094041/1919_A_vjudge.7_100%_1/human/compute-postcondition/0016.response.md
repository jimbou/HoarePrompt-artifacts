Postcondition: **`test` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `t` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), stdin contains `test-3` lines, each containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9), and either 'Bob' or 'Alice' is being printed depending on whether the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd.**
