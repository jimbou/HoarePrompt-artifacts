Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob, where they take turns exchanging wallets and removing coins. The player who cannot make a valid move loses.

The provided program uses a simple approach to determine the winner. It calculates the sum of the coins in both wallets (a + b) and checks if it is even or odd using the bitwise AND operator (&). If the sum is even, it prints 'Bob', otherwise it prints 'Alice'.

The reasoning behind this approach is that the game can be viewed as a series of moves where each player tries to force the other player to make a move that will leave them with an empty wallet. Since the players alternate turns, the total number of moves made by both players will be equal to the sum of the coins in both wallets.

If the sum of the coins is even, it means that the total number of moves is even, and therefore Alice (who makes the first move) will make an even number of moves. Since Bob makes the second move, he will make an odd number of moves. In this case, Bob will win because he will be the one to make the last move, leaving Alice with an empty wallet.

On the other hand, if the sum of the coins is odd, it means that the total number of moves is odd, and therefore Alice will make an odd number of moves. In this case, Alice will win because she will be the one to make the last move, leaving Bob with an empty wallet.

The program correctly implements this logic and produces the correct output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
