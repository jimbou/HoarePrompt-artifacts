Based on the precondition, the code will print the string 'Alice'.

The value of `test` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), but it does not affect the output of the print statement.

The value of `t` is 1, but it also does not affect the output of the print statement.

The values of `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), but they also do not affect the output of the print statement.

The fact that stdin contains `test-3` lines, each containing two integers `a` and `b`, does not affect the output of the print statement.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is simply the string 'Alice'.

Output: **Alice**
