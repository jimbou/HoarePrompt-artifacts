The only variable in the loop head is `t` and `test`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t` and `test`. If `t` is less than `test`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is 0, `test` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `t` must be increased by 1 and `test` must be greater than 1.
State: **`test` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `t` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), stdin contains `test-2` lines, each containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9).**
