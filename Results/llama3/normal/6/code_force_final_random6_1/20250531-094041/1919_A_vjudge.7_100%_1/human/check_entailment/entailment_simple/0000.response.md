Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob, where they take turns exchanging wallets and removing coins. The key insight is that the game is won by the player who can make the last move, which occurs when the sum of the coins in both wallets is odd.

The provided program uses the bitwise AND operator (&) to check if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd. If the sum is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. This logic is correct because when the sum is even, Alice will always be forced to make the last move, and when the sum is odd, Bob will always be forced to make the last move.

The program correctly reads the input, iterates over the test cases, and prints the winner for each case. The state of the program before the function call is correctly described, and the state after the function call is also correctly described.

Correctness: **True**
