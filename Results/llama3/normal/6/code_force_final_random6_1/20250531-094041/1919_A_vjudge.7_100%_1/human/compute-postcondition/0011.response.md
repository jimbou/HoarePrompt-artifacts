Output State: **`test` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `t` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), stdin contains `test-3` lines, each containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9).**

In this output state, the values of `test` and `t` remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `b` are updated to the two integers read from the first line of the input, which are between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). The stdin now contains `test-3` lines, each containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9), since one line has been read and processed.
