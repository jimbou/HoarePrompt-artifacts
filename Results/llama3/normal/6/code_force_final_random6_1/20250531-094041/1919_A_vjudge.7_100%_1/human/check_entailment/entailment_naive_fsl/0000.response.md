Correctness: **True**

The program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the total number of coins in both Alice's and Bob's wallets. The key insight is that the game is won by the player who can make the last move, which is determined by the parity of the total number of coins.

The program uses the bitwise AND operator (&) to check if the sum of the coins is even (a + b & 1 == 0). If the sum is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. This is because if the sum is even, Alice will always be forced to make the last move, and if the sum is odd, Bob will always be forced to make the last move.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including when the number of coins in both wallets is the same, when one wallet has more coins than the other, and when the total number of coins is even or odd.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
