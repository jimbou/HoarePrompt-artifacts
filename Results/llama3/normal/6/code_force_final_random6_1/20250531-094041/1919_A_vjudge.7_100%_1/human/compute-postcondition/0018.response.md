Output State: **`test` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `t` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) and are the values of the first line of the stdin, stdin contains `test-3` lines, each containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9), and either 'Bob' or 'Alice' is being printed depending on whether the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd.**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` have been updated to the values of the first line of the stdin, which contains two integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). The stdin now contains `test-3` lines, each containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9). The values of `test` and `t` remain unchanged. The output state also indicates that either 'Bob' or 'Alice' is being printed depending on whether the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd.
