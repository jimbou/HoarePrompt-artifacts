Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), v is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i), stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), which is the number of distinct integers in the test case. The list `v` contains `n+1` integers, where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the `n` distinct integers `p_1, p_2, ..., p_n` (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i). The stdin contains `t-1` test cases, as one test case has been processed by the code.
