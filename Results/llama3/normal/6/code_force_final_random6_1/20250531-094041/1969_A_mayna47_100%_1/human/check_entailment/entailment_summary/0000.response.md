Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The problem requires finding the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.
2.  The program correctly reads the input values, including the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `v`.
3.  It then checks if any friend's best friend is equal to their 1-based index. If such a pair is found, it means that inviting these two friends will result in at least 2 friends attending the party, so it prints 2.
4.  If no such pair is found, it means that inviting any single friend will not result in at least 2 friends attending the party. In this case, inviting 3 friends will guarantee that at least 2 friends attend, so it prints 3.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, printing 2 when a matching pair is found and 3 otherwise.

Correctness: **True**
