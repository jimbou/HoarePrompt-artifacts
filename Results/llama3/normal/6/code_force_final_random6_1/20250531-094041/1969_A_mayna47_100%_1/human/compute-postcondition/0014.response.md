Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `v` is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i), stdin contains t-2 test cases. If the value at index `v[i]` in list `v` is equal to `i`, then the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
