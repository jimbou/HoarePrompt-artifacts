Output State: **The program returns nothing and prints the number 2. The current value of `v[v[i]]` still equals `i`, and the list `v` remains unchanged with its first element being 0 and the remaining elements being the n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i). The variable `i` is still 1, and `n` is still at least 1.**
