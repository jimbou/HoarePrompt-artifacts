Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to have at least 2 friends come to the party.

The program first checks if there are any pairs of friends who are each other's best friends. If it finds such a pair, it prints 2, because Monocarp only needs to send invitations to these two friends.

If it doesn't find any such pairs, it prints 3, because in this case, Monocarp needs to send invitations to at least three friends to have at least two of them come to the party.

The program correctly handles all possible cases:

* If there are pairs of friends who are each other's best friends, it prints 2.
* If there are no such pairs, it prints 3.

The program also correctly handles the edge cases:

* If n is 2, it prints 2, because Monocarp only needs to send invitations to both friends.
* If n is greater than 2, it prints 2 if it finds a pair of friends who are each other's best friends, and 3 otherwise.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all possible inputs.
