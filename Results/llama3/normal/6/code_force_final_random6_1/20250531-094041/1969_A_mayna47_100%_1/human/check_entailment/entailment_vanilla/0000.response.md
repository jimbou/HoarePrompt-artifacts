Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to his friends so that at least 2 of them come to the party. The program iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it checks if there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends. If such a pair is found, the program prints 2, indicating that Monocarp needs to send invitations to only these two friends. If no such pair is found, the program prints 3, indicating that Monocarp needs to send invitations to at least three friends.

The program's logic is correct because it takes into account the fact that each friend has a unique best friend, and that a friend will only come to the party if both they and their best friend receive an invitation. By checking for pairs of friends who are each other's best friends, the program is able to determine the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party.

However, the program does not handle the case where the number of friends is less than 2. According to the problem description, the number of friends is guaranteed to be at least 2, so this is not a concern.

Correctness: **True**
