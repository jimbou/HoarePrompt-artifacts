The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 1 and i is now 1. 
State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `v` is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i), stdin contains t-1 test cases**
