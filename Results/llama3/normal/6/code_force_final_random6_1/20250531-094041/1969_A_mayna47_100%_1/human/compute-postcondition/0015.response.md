Output State: **`n` is at least `n`, `i` is `n+1`, `v` is a list of `n+1` integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the `n` distinct integers `p_1, p_2, ..., p_n` (1 <= `p_i` <= `n`; `p_i` != `i`), stdin contains `t-n` test cases. If the value at index `v[i]` in list `v` is equal to `i` at any point during the loop execution, then the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, no action is taken.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations means that the loop has finished executing and the variables have reached their final values. The value of `n` remains the same as it was initially, `i` has incremented to `n+1` after the last iteration, and the list `v` remains unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin has decreased by `n` as each iteration of the loop processes one test case. If at any point during the loop execution, the value at index `v[i]` in list `v` was equal to `i`, then the number 2 was printed. If this condition was never met, no action was taken.
