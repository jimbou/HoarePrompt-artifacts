Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to his friends so that at least 2 of them come to the party. The program iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it checks if there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends. If such a pair is found, the program prints 2, indicating that Monocarp needs to send invitations to only these two friends. If no such pair is found, the program prints 3, indicating that Monocarp needs to send invitations to at least 3 friends.

The program's logic is correct because it takes into account the fact that each friend's best friend is distinct and that a friend will only come to the party if both they and their best friend receive an invitation. By checking for pairs of friends who are each other's best friends, the program is able to determine the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party.

Correctness: **True**
