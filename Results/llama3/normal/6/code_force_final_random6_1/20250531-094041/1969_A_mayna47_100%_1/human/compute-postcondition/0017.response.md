Output: **`n` is at least `n`, `i` is `n+1`, `v` is a list of `n+1` integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the `n` distinct integers `p_1, p_2, ..., p_n` (1 <= `p_i` <= `n`; `p_i` != `i`), stdin contains `t-n` test cases. If the value at index `v[i]` in list `v` is equal to `i` at any point during the loop execution, then the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, no action is taken, and the number 3 is printed**
