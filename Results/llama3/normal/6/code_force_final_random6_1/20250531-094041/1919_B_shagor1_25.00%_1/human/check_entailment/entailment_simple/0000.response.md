Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then enters a loop that runs `t` times.

2. Inside the loop, the program reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself.

3. It then counts the number of '-' characters in the string `s` and stores it in the variable `neg`.

4. The program then prints the minimum possible penalty, which is calculated as `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise it's `n`. This is because the optimal way to split the array is to group all the '+' characters together and all the '-' characters together. The penalty of a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. If the number of '+' characters is not equal to the number of '-' characters, then the minimum penalty is achieved by grouping all the '+' characters together and all the '-' characters together. The sum of the '+' characters is `n - neg` and the sum of the '-' characters is `-neg`. The penalty is then `n - 2 * neg`. If `n` is equal to `neg`, then the minimum penalty is `n`, because the array can be split into single-element arrays, each with a penalty of 1.

Correctness: **True**
