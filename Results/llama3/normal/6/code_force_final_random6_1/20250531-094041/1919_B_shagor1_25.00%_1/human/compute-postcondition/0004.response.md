Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of "+" and "-" characters that must have at least 1 character, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one. If the first character `i` of the string `s` is '-', then `neg` is 1. Otherwise, `neg` remains unchanged.**
