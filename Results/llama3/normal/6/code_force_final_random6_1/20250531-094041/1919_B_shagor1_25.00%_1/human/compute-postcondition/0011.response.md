Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, s is a string of length n consisting of "+" and "-" characters, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, neg is equal to the number of '-' characters in s.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `neg` will be equal to the total number of '-' characters in the string `s`. The other variables `n` and `stdin` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
