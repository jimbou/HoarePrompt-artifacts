Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of "+" and "-" characters that must have at least 2 characters, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is the third character of the string `s`. If `i` is '-', then `neg` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `neg` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains the same, the string `s` remains the same, the number of test cases in `stdin` remains the same, and the value of `i` remains the same. However, the value of `neg` is increased by 1, regardless of whether `i` is '-' or not.
