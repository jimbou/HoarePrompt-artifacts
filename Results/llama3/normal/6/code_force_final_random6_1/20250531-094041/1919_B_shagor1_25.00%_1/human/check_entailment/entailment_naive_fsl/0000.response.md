Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty by counting the number of negative signs in the string and then subtracting twice the count of negative signs from the total length of the string. This is because each negative sign contributes -1 to the sum, and the penalty is the absolute value of the sum multiplied by the length of the string. By subtracting twice the count of negative signs, the program effectively calculates the minimum possible penalty.

The program also handles the edge case where the string consists only of negative signs (i.e., `n == neg`) by printing the length of the string, which is the correct minimum penalty in this case.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
