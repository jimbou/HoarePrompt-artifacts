Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of "+" and "-" characters that must have at least 1 character, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is the second character of the string `s`, `neg` is increased by 1**

In this output state, the value of `neg` has been increased by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. The string `s` still has a length of `n`, which is between 1 and 5000 inclusive, and consists of "+" and "-" characters. The second character of the string `s` is still stored in the variable `i`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
