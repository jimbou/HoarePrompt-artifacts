According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If the string `s` has at least 1 character the loop executes. Before the loop starts, n is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, s is a string of length n consisting of "+" and "-" characters, neg is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. So for the loop to be executed  the string `s` must have at least 1 character and the variable `i` is the first character in the string `s`.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, `s` is a string of length n consisting of "+" and "-" characters that must have at least 1 character, `neg` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is the first character in the string `s`**
