This function reads a test case from standard input, consisting of an integer n and a string s of length n containing "+" and "-" characters. It then calculates and prints the result of the expression n - 2 * neg if n is not equal to the number of '-' characters in s, otherwise it prints n. The function does not modify the input variables and does not have any side effects other than printing the result.
