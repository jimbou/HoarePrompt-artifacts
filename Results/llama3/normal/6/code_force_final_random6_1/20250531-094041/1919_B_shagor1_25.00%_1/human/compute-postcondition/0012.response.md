The code prints the value of `n` minus twice the number of '-' characters in the string `s` if the length of the string `s` is not equal to the number of '-' characters in the string `s`, otherwise it prints the value of `n`. Where `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, and `neg` is the number of '-' characters in the string `s`.

Output: **n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n (where n is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, and neg is the number of '-' characters in the string s)**
