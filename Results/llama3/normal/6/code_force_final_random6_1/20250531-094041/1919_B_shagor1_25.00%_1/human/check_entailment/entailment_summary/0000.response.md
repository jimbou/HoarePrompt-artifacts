Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty by counting the number of '-' characters in the string and using the formula n - 2 * neg if n is not equal to the number of '-' characters, otherwise it prints n.

The logic behind this is that the penalty is calculated as the absolute value of the sum of the array multiplied by its length. In this case, the array is represented by the string s, where '+' represents 1 and '-' represents -1. The sum of the array is therefore the number of '+' characters minus the number of '-' characters.

If the number of '+' characters is not equal to the number of '-' characters, the minimum possible penalty is achieved by splitting the array into subarrays of '+' characters and '-' characters separately. The penalty for each subarray is then the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The formula n - 2 * neg calculates this penalty correctly. It subtracts twice the number of '-' characters from the total length of the string, which gives the number of '+' characters minus the number of '-' characters. This is the sum of the array, and multiplying it by the length of the string gives the penalty.

If the number of '+' characters is equal to the number of '-' characters, the minimum possible penalty is achieved by not splitting the array at all. In this case, the penalty is simply the length of the string, which is printed by the program.

Therefore, the program correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
