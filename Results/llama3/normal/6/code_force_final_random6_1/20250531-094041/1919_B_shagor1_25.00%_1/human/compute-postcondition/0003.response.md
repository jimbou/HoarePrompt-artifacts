Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of "+" and "-" characters that must have at least 1 character, `neg` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, and the first character `i` of the string `s` is currently '-'**.

In this output state, the value of `neg` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `neg` being 1. The other variables remain unchanged, with `n` still being an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, `s` still being a string of length `n` consisting of "+" and "-" characters, and `stdin` still containing multiple test cases minus one. Additionally, the first character `i` of the string `s` is still '-'.
