Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the operation described in the problem. The operation allows deleting an element that is at least 10 and inserting its digits in the same position, but the program only checks if the previous element is greater than the current element and greater than 10 before performing the operation. This is not sufficient to ensure that the array can be made sorted in non-decreasing order.

For example, consider the input [12, 3, 45, 67]. The program will split the first element into [1, 2, 3, 45, 67], but it will not split the third element into [4, 5, 67], which is necessary to make the array sorted in non-decreasing order.

The program also uses a function `func_1` to check if the list is sorted, but this function is not necessary and can be removed. The program can simply check if the list is sorted after performing the operation.

To fix the program, it needs to be modified to correctly implement the operation and check if the array can be made sorted in non-decreasing order. One possible solution is to use a recursive approach to try all possible ways of splitting the elements and check if the resulting array is sorted.
