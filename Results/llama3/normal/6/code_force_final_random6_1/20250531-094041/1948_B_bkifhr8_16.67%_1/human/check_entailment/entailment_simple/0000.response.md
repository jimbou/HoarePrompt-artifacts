Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the operation described in the problem statement and checks if the resulting array is sorted. The function `func_1` is not defined in the given code, but based on the state of the program before the function call, it is assumed to check if the list is sorted.

The program iterates through the array from the second element to the last. If it finds an element that is smaller than the previous one and the previous element is greater than 10, it splits the previous element into two digits and inserts them into the array. This is done by popping the previous element, inserting the first digit of the previous element at the same position, and inserting the second digit of the previous element at the next position.

After performing this operation for all elements, the program checks if the resulting array is sorted by calling the `func_1` function. If the array is sorted, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

Correctness: **True**
