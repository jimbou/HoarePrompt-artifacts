Output State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers less than or equal to 99, `sorted_lst` is a sorted list of non-negative integers less than or equal to 99.**

In this output state, the list `lst` remains unchanged, still containing non-negative integers less than or equal to 99. However, a new variable `sorted_lst` is introduced, which is a sorted version of the original list `lst`. The sorting is done in ascending order, meaning the smallest integer in the list comes first, followed by the next smallest, and so on, until the largest integer. The `sorted_lst` contains the same integers as `lst`, but in a sorted order.
