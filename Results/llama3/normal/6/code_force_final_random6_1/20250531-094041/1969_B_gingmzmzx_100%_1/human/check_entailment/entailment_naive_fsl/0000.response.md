Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, consider the input string "101". The program will output 2, but the correct answer is 1. The program is not considering the case where a single cyclic shift can sort the string.

The program is trying to count the number of operations needed to sort the string by counting the number of times a 0 is followed by a 1 and the number of times a 1 is followed by a 0. However, this approach is not correct because it does not consider the case where a single cyclic shift can sort the string.

A correct approach would be to find the longest substring of consecutive 0s and 1s and then calculate the minimum number of operations needed to sort the string. This can be done by iterating through the string and keeping track of the longest substring of consecutive 0s and 1s. The minimum number of operations needed to sort the string is then the length of the string minus the length of the longest substring of consecutive 0s and 1s.

Here is a correct implementation of the problem:

```
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = input().strip()
        zeroes = s.count('0')
        ones = s.count('1')
        max_consecutive = 0
        current_consecutive = 1
        for i in range(1, len(s)):
            if s[i] == s[i-1]:
                current_consecutive += 1
            else:
                max_consecutive = max(max_consecutive, current_consecutive)
                current_consecutive = 1
        max_consecutive = max(max_consecutive, current_consecutive)
        print(len(s) - max_consecutive)
```

This program works by iterating through the string and keeping track of the longest substring of consecutive 0s and 1s. The minimum number of operations needed to sort the string is then the length of the string minus the length of the longest substring of consecutive 0s and 1s.
