Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `zeroes` is an integer, `cnt` is a list of two integers where `cnt[c]` is increased by 1, `ans` is 0, `stdin` contains n-1 binary strings, `c` is the first element in the list `s`.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt[c]` has been increased by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The list `cnt` now contains two integers where the value at index `c` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial values and properties.
