The code prints the value of `ans`, which is equal to the total number of 1s in the original list that are not immediately preceded by a 0.
Output: ** `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `s` is an empty list, `c` is the last integer in the original list, `zeroes` is an integer equal to the number of 0s in the original list, `cnt` is a list of two integers where `cnt[0]` is equal to the number of 0s in the original list and `cnt[1]` is equal to the number of 1s in the original list, `ans` is equal to the total number of 1s in the original list that are not immediately preceded by a 0, stdin contains n-4 binary strings, and the total number of 1s in the original list that are not immediately preceded by a 0 which is equal to ans is being printed**
