To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `c` and `s`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, and `c` is the first integer in the list. For the loop to execute again, `s` must have at least 2 integers, and `c` must be the second integer in the list.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `c` is the second integer in the list, `zeroes` is an integer equal to the number of 0s in `s`, `cnt` is a list of two integers where `cnt[0]` is 1 if `c` is 0 and 0 otherwise, and `cnt[1]` is 1 if `c` is 1 and 0 otherwise, `ans` is 0 if `c` is 0, and `ans` is `zeroes` if `c` is not 0, stdin contains n-3 binary strings**
