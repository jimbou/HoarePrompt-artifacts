Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `zeroes` is an integer, `cnt` is a list of two integers where `cnt[c]` is increased by 1, `stdin` contains n-1 binary strings, `c` is the first element in the list `s`. If `c` is 0, `ans` is either 0 or 1. If `c` is not 0, `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0]`.***
