Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `c` is the third integer in the list, `zeroes` is an integer equal to the number of 0s in `s`, `cnt` is a list of two integers where `cnt[0]` is 1 if `c` is 0 and 1 otherwise, and `cnt[1]` is 1 if `c` is 1 and 0 otherwise, `cnt[c]` is increased by 1, `ans` is `zeroes` if `c` is 0 and `ans` is `zeroes` if `c` is not 0 and `ans` is `ans`+1 if `c` is 1, stdin contains n-3 binary strings. If `c` is 0, `ans` is `zeroes` - 1. If `c` is not 0, `ans` is `zeroes` - 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `ans` has been updated. If `c` is 0, `ans` is now `zeroes` - 1. If `c` is not 0, `ans` is now `zeroes` - 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
