Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `zeroes` is an integer, `cnt` is a list of two integers where `cnt[c]` is increased by 1, `stdin` contains n-1 binary strings, `c` is the second element in the list `s`. If `c` is 0, `ans` is either 0 or 1 plus `zeroes - cnt[0]`. If `c` is not 0, `ans` is 2*(`zeroes - cnt[0]`).**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated based on the initial state. If `c` is 0, `ans` is either 0 or 1 plus `zeroes - cnt[0]`, and if `c` is not 0, `ans` is 2*(`zeroes - cnt[0]`). The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
