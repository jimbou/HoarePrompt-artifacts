Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `zeroes` is an integer, `cnt` is a list of two integers where `cnt[c]` is increased by 1, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `stdin` contains n-1 binary strings, `c` is the first element in the list `s` and its current value is 0**

The code increments the value of `ans` by 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, otherwise, it remains the same. Since the initial value of `ans` is 0, it can either remain 0 or become 1 depending on the value of `cnt[1]`. The values of the other variables are not affected.
