Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `c` is the first integer in the list, `zeroes` is an integer equal to the number of 0s in `s`, `cnt` is a list of two integers where `cnt[0]` is 1 if `c` is 0 and 0 otherwise, and `cnt[1]` is 1 if `c` is 1 and 0 otherwise, `ans` is 0, stdin contains n-3 binary strings.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt[c]` has been incremented by 1, which means that the count of the first integer `c` in the list `s` has been increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
