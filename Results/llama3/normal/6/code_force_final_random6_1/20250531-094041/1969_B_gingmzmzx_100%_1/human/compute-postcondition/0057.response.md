Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 2,  `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `c` is the second integer in the list, `zeroes` is an integer equal to the number of 0s in s, `cnt` is a list of two integers where `cnt[0]` is equal to the number of 0s in s and `cnt[1]` is equal to the number of 1s in s plus one if c is 1 and cnt[c] is increased by 1, `ans` is equal to the total number of 1s in the original list that are not immediately preceded by a 0, stdin contains n-4 binary strings.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `ans` has been updated. The value of `ans` is now equal to the total number of 1s in the original list that are not immediately preceded by a 0. This is because `ans` was previously either 0 or 1 if `c` is 0, and now it has been incremented by the difference between the number of zeroes in the list and the number of zeroes counted in `cnt[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
