Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 2,  `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `c` is the first integer in the list and its current value is 0, `zeroes` is an integer equal to the number of 0s in s, `cnt` is a list of two integers where `cnt[0]` is equal to the number of 0s in s and `cnt[1]` is equal to the number of 1s in s, `ans` is either 0 or 1, stdin contains n-4 binary strings, and the total number of 1s in the original list that are not immediately preceded by a 0 which `ans` is being printed.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated based on the condition `cnt[1] > 0`. If there are any 1s in the list `s` (i.e., `cnt[1] > 0`), then `ans` is incremented by 1, otherwise, it remains 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
