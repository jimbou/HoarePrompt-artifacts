To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `c` and `s`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `c` is the first integer in the list `s`, and `s` has at least 1 integer. For the loop to execute again, `s` must have at least 2 integers, and `c` must be the second integer in the list.

Here's the updated state:

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 2,  `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `c` is the second integer in the list, `zeroes` is an integer equal to the number of 0s in s, `cnt` is a list of two integers where `cnt[0]` is equal to the number of 0s in s and `cnt[1]` is equal to the number of 1s in s plus one if c is 1, `ans` is either 0 or 1 if `c` is 0, otherwise `ans` is equal to the total number of 1s in the original list that are not immediately preceded by a 0, stdin contains n-4 binary strings.**
