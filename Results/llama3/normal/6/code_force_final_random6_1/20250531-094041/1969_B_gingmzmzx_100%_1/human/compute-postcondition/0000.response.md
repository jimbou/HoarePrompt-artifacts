The code `n = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by `t` binary strings `s` (2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5; s_i in {0, 1}).

Since `n` is assigned the value of the first integer in the input, which is `t`, the value of `n` is now `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4).

The remaining input in the stdin is the `t` binary strings `s` (2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5; s_i in {0, 1}).

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `n` binary strings (2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5; s_i in {0, 1})**
