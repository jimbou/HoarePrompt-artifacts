Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 0, s is an empty list, zeroes is an integer, cnt is a list of two integers where cnt[c] is increased by the number of times c appears in s, stdin contains n-1 binary strings, ans is the sum of zeroes - cnt[0] for all 1s in s plus the number of 0s in s that appear after at least one 1.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the list `s` will be empty, the count of each element in `s` will be stored in `cnt`, and the answer `ans` will be the sum of the number of times a 1 appears in `s` multiplied by the number of zeroes minus the count of zeroes, plus the number of times a 0 appears in `s` after at least one 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
