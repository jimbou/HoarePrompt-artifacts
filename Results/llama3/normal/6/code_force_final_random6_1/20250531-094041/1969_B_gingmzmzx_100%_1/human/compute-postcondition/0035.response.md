Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `c` is the second integer in the list, `zeroes` is an integer equal to the number of 0s in `s`, `cnt` is a list of two integers where `cnt[0]` is 1 if `c` is 0 and 1 otherwise, and `cnt[1]` is 1 if `c` is 1 and 1 otherwise, `ans` is `zeroes` - 1 if `c` is 0, and `ans` is `zeroes` - 1 if `c` is not 0, stdin contains n-3 binary strings.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated based on the initial values of `zeroes` and `cnt[0]`. If `c` is 0, `ans` is now `zeroes` - 1, and if `c` is not 0, `ans` is still `zeroes`. The values of the other variables remain the same.
