The only variable in the loop head is variable  `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `s` is an empty list, `c` is the last integer in the original list, `zeroes` is an integer equal to the number of 0s in the original list, `cnt` is a list of two integers where `cnt[0]` is equal to the number of 0s in the original list and `cnt[1]` is equal to the number of 1s in the original list, `ans` is the total number of 1s in the original list that are not immediately preceded by a 0, stdin contains n-3 binary strings, and the total number of 1s in the original list that are not immediately preceded by a 0 which is ans is being printed**
