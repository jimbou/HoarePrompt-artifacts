Based on the precondition, the `print(ans)` statement will print the total number of 1s in the original list that are not immediately preceded by a 0.

Since `ans` is the total number of 1s in the original list that are not immediately preceded by a 0, the print statement will output this calculated value.

Output: **the total number of 1s in the original list that are not immediately preceded by a 0**
