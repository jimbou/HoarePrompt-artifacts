Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `c` is the first integer in the list and is equal to 0, `zeroes` is an integer equal to the number of 0s in `s`, `cnt` is a list of two integers where `cnt[0]` is 1 and `cnt[1]` is 0, `ans` is 0, stdin contains n-3 binary strings.**

The value of `ans` is updated based on the condition `cnt[1] > 0`. Since `cnt[1]` is 0, the condition is false, and `ans` remains 0. The values of the other variables are not affected.
