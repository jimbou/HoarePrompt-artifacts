Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `zeroes` is an integer, `cnt` is a list of two integers where `cnt[c]` is increased by 1, `stdin` contains n-1 binary strings, `c` is the third element in the list `s`. If `c` is 0, `ans` is either 1 or 2. If `c` is not 0, `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0] + 1` if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, otherwise `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0]`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `cnt[c]` has been increased by 1. The value of `ans` remains the same, but its expression has been updated to reflect the new value of `cnt[c]`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
