Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `zeroes` is an integer, `cnt` is a list of two integers where `cnt[c]` is increased by 1, `stdin` contains n-1 binary strings, `c` is the third element in the list `s`. If `c` is 0, `ans` is either 3 or 4. If `c` is not 0 and `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, `ans` is 2 * zeroes - 2 * cnt[0] + 1, otherwise `ans` is 2 * zeroes - 2 * cnt[0].**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated based on the initial state. If `c` is 0, `ans` is either 3 or 4. If `c` is not 0 and `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, `ans` is 2 * zeroes - 2 * cnt[0] + 1, otherwise `ans` is 2 * zeroes - 2 * cnt[0]. The other variables remain unchanged.
