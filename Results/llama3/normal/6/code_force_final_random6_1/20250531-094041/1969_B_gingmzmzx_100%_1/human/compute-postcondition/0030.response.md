The value of `ans` is updated by adding the difference between `zeroes` and `cnt[0]`. Since `cnt[0]` is 0, the value of `ans` becomes `ans + zeroes`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `c` is the first integer in the list, `zeroes` is an integer equal to the number of 0s in `s`, `cnt` is a list of two integers where `cnt[0]` is 0 and `cnt[1]` is 1, `ans` is `zeroes`, stdin contains n-3 binary strings, and `c` is not 0**
