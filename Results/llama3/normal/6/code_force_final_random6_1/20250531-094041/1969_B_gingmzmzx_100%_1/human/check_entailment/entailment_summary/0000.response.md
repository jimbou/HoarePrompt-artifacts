Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order by cyclically shifting substrings. The program works by counting the number of zeroes in the string and then iterating through the string, keeping track of the count of zeroes and ones encountered so far. It increments the answer whenever it encounters a zero that is not immediately preceded by a zero or a one that is not immediately preceded by a one. This is because these are the positions where a cyclic shift operation would be needed to sort the string. The program correctly handles the case where the string is already sorted, in which case the answer is zero.

Correctness: **True**
