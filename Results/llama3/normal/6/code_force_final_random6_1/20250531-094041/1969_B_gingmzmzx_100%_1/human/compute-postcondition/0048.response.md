Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 2,  `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `c` is the first integer in the list, `zeroes` is an integer equal to the number of 0s in s, `cnt` is a list of two integers where `cnt[0]` is equal to the number of 0s in s and `cnt[1]` is equal to the number of 1s in s plus one if c is 1, `ans` is 0, stdin contains n-4 binary strings, and the total number of 1s in the original list that are not immediately preceded by a 0 which `ans` is being printed**

In this output state, the value of `cnt[1]` has been updated to be equal to the number of 1s in `s` plus one if `c` is 1, because `cnt[c]` was incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
