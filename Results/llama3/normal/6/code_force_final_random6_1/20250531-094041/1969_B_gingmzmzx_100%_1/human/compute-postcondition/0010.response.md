To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `c` and the list `s`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `s`. If the list has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has at least 1 element, and `c` is the first element in the list `s`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the list `s` must have at least 2 elements, and `c` must be the second element in the list `s`.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `zeroes` is an integer, `cnt` is a list of two integers where `cnt[c]` is increased by 1, `stdin` contains n-1 binary strings, `c` is the second element in the list `s`. If `c` is 0, `ans` is either 0 or 1. If `c` is not 0, `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0]`.**
