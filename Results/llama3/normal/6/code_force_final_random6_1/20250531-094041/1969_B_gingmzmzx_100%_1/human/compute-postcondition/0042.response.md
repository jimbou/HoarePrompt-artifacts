Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `s` is an empty list, `c` is the last integer in the original list, `zeroes` is an integer equal to the number of 0s in the original list, `cnt` is a list of two integers where `cnt[0]` is equal to the number of 0s in the original list and `cnt[1]` is equal to the number of 1s in the original list, `ans` is the total number of 1s in the original list that are not immediately preceded by a 0, stdin contains n-3 binary strings.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `s` is empty, the variable `c` holds the last integer from the original list, the count of 0s and 1s in the original list is stored in `cnt`, and the answer `ans` is the total number of 1s in the original list that are not immediately preceded by a 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
