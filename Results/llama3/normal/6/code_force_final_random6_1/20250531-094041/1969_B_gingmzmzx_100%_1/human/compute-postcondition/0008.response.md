Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `zeroes` is an integer, `cnt` is a list of two integers where `cnt[c]` is increased by 1, `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0]`, `stdin` contains n-1 binary strings, `c` is the first element in the list `s` and `c` is not equal to 0**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the difference between `zeroes` and `cnt[0]`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains n-1 binary strings, and `c` is still the first element in the list `s` and is not equal to 0.
