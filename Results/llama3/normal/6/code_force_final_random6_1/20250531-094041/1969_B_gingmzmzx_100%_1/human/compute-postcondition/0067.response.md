Output State: **n is an integer equal to 0, _ is equal to n, s is an empty list, c is the last integer in the original list, zeroes is an integer equal to the number of 0s in the original list, cnt is a list of two integers where cnt[0] is equal to the number of 0s in the original list and cnt[1] is equal to the number of 1s in the original list, ans is equal to the total number of 1s in the original list that are not immediately preceded by a 0, stdin contains 0 binary strings, and the total number of 1s in the original list that are not immediately preceded by a 0 which is equal to ans is being printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the loop counter `_` will be equal to the initial value of `n`, the list `s` will be empty, the variable `c` will hold the last integer from the original list, `zeroes` will be equal to the total number of 0s in the original list, `cnt` will hold the total count of 0s and 1s in the original list, `ans` will hold the total number of 1s in the original list that are not immediately preceded by a 0, and there will be no more binary strings left in the standard input. The final value of `ans` will be printed.
