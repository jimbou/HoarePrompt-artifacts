Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `zeroes` is an integer, `cnt` is a list of two integers where `cnt[c]` is increased by 1, `stdin` contains n-1 binary strings, `c` is the third element in the list `s`. If `c` is 0, `ans` is either 2 or 3. If `c` is not 0, `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0] + 2` if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, otherwise `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0]`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated based on the condition `cnt[1] > 0`. If `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, `ans` is incremented by 1, otherwise it remains the same. The other variables remain unchanged.
