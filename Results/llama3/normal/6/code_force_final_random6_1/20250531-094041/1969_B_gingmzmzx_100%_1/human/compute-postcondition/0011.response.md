Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `zeroes` is an integer, `cnt` is a list of two integers where `cnt[c]` is increased by 1, `stdin` contains n-1 binary strings, `c` is the second element in the list `s`. If `c` is 0, `ans` is either 0 or 1. If `c` is not 0, `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0]`.**

The value of `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1. The other variables are not affected by this code. The value of `c` is the second element in the list `s`, and the value of `ans` depends on the value of `c`. If `c` is 0, `ans` is either 0 or 1. If `c` is not 0, `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0]`. The stdin contains n-1 binary strings.
