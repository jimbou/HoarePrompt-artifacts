Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `c` is the third integer in the list, `zeroes` is an integer equal to the number of 0s in `s`, `cnt` is a list of two integers where `cnt[0]` is 1 if `c` is 0 and 1 otherwise, and `cnt[1]` is 1 if `c` is 1 and 0 otherwise, `cnt[c]` is increased by 1, `ans` is 1 if `c` is 1 and `ans` is `zeroes` if `c` is not 0 and `ans` is `ans`+1 if `c` is 1, stdin contains n-3 binary strings. If `c` is 0, `ans` is `zeroes` - 1. If `c` is not 0, `ans` is `zeroes` - 1.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt[c]` has been increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is still dependent on the value of `c`. If `c` is 0, `ans` is `zeroes` - 1. If `c` is not 0, `ans` is `zeroes` - 1. The stdin still contains n-3 binary strings.
