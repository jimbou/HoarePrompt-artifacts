Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `n` binary strings (2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5; s_i in {0, 1})
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
    zeroes = s.count(0)
    cnt = [0, 0]
    ans = 0
    for c in s:
        cnt[c] += 1
        if c == 0:
            ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
        else:
            ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 0, s is an empty list, zeroes is an integer, cnt is a list of two integers where cnt[c] is increased by the number of times c appears in s, stdin contains n-1 binary strings, ans is the sum of zeroes - cnt[0] for all 1s in s plus the number of 0s in s that appear after at least one 1, and the value of ans is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `s` is an empty list, `c` is the last integer in the original list, `zeroes` is an integer equal to the number of 0s in the original list, `cnt` is a list of two integers where `cnt[0]` is equal to the number of 0s in the original list and `cnt[1]` is equal to the number of 1s in the original list, `ans` is the total number of 1s in the original list that are not immediately preceded by a 0, stdin contains n-3 binary strings, and the total number of 1s in the original list that are not immediately preceded by a 0 which is ans is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `s` is an empty list, `c` is the last integer in the original list, `zeroes` is an integer equal to the number of 0s in the original list, `cnt` is a list of two integers where `cnt[0]` is equal to the number of 0s in the original list and `cnt[1]` is equal to the number of 1s in the original list, `ans` is equal to the total number of 1s in the original list that are not immediately preceded by a 0, stdin contains n-4 binary strings, and the total number of 1s in the original list that are not immediately preceded by a 0 which is equal to ans is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
