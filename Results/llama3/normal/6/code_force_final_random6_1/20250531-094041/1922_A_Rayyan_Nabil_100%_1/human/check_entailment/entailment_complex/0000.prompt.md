Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

Example

Input

    1
    
    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb
    
    aa

    mathforces
    
    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

# Annotated Functions:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, a, b, and c are strings of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
            return 'YES'
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer, `a`, `b`, `c` are strings of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. If there exists an `i` such that `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`, the program returns the string 'YES'. Otherwise, no action is taken.
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns the string 'NO'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function compares three strings of equal length and returns 'YES' if it finds a position where both strings a and b differ from string c, otherwise it returns 'NO'.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer, a, b, c are strings consisting of n lowercase Latin letters.
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        
        a = input().strip()
        
        b = input().strip()
        
        c = input().strip()
        
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
        
    #State: t is 0, n is a positive integer equal to the input integer, a is a string consisting of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string consisting of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string consisting of n lowercase Latin letters, results is a list containing the results of func_1(n, a, b, c) for all iterations, stdin is empty
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `n` is a positive integer equal to the input integer, `a` is a string consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for all iterations, `result` is the last result in the list, `stdin` is empty, and the last result in the list which is `result` is being printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a series of inputs from the user, where each input consists of a positive integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n` containing lowercase Latin letters. It then calls another function `func_1` with these inputs and stores the results in a list. After all inputs have been processed, the function prints each result in the list. The function does not modify the input variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, or `c`, and it does not perform any actions other than reading input, calling `func_1`, storing results, and printing output.
