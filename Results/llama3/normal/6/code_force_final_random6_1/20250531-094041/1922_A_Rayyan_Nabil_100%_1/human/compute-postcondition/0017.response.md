Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is a positive integer equal to the input integer, `a` is a string consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for all iterations, `result` is the last result in the list, `stdin` is empty, and the last result in the list which is `result` is being printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The `results` list contains all the results of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for all iterations, and the `result` variable holds the last result in the list. The last result in the list is being printed.
