Output State: **t is 0, n is a positive integer equal to the input integer, a is a string consisting of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string consisting of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string consisting of n lowercase Latin letters, results is a list containing the results of func_1(n, a, b, c) for all iterations, stdin is empty**

This output state means that after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the variable t will be 0, indicating that the loop has completed its execution. The variables n, a, b, and c will retain their last values, which are the input integer and the strings consisting of n lowercase Latin letters, respectively. The results list will contain the results of the func_1 function for all iterations of the loop. Finally, the stdin will be empty, indicating that all input has been consumed by the loop.
