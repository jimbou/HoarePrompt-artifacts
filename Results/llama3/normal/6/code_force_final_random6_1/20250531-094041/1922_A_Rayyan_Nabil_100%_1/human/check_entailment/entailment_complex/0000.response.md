Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem where it needs to determine if there exists a template string `t` such that two given strings `a` and `b` match it, while a third string `c` does not.

Function `func_1` takes three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of equal length and checks if there exists a position where both `a` and `b` differ from `c`. If such a position is found, it returns 'YES', indicating that a template string `t` can be constructed that matches `a` and `b` but not `c`. If no such position is found, it returns 'NO'.

Function `func_2` reads a series of inputs from the user, where each input consists of a positive integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n` containing lowercase Latin letters. It then calls `func_1` with these inputs and stores the results in a list. After all inputs have been processed, it prints each result in the list.

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It checks all possible positions in the strings to find a position where both `a` and `b` differ from `c`, which is the condition required for the template string `t` to exist.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
