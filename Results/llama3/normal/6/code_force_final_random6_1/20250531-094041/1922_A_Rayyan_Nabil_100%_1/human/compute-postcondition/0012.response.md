The code prints the second result in the list, which is stored in the variable `result`. This result is one of the outputs of the function `func_1(n, a, b, c)`, where `n` is a positive integer, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters.

Output: **the second result of func_1(n, a, b, c) (where n is a positive integer, and a, b, and c are strings consisting of n lowercase Latin letters)**
