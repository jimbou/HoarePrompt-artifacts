Output State: **t is greater than 0 and decreased by 2, n is a positive integer equal to the input integer, a is a string consisting of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string consisting of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string consisting of n lowercase Latin letters, results is a list containing the result of func_1(n, a, b, c) and the new result of func_1(n, a, b, c), stdin is empty**

The code snippet consists of four lines that read input from stdin and append the result of a function call to a list. Here's the combined effect of all lines:

1. `n = int(input().strip())`: This line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`. Since `n` was previously a positive integer equal to the input integer, its value is updated to the new input integer.

2. `a = input().strip()`: This line reads a string from stdin and assigns it to `a`. Since `a` was previously a string consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters, its value is updated to the new string, which also consists of `n` lowercase Latin letters.

3. `b = input().strip()`: This line reads a string from stdin and assigns it to `b`. Since `b` was previously a string consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters, its value is updated to the new string, which also consists of `n` lowercase Latin letters.

4. `c = input().strip()`: This line reads a string from stdin and assigns it to `c`. Since `c` was previously a string consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters, its value is updated to the new string, which also consists of `n` lowercase Latin letters.

5. `results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))`: This line appends the result of the function call `func_1(n, a, b, c)` to the list `results`. Since `results` was previously a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` and the new result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`, its value is updated to include the new result of the function call.

The variable `t` is not affected by the code snippet, so its value remains greater than 0 and decreased by 2. The variable `stdin` is empty after the code execution, as all input has been read.
