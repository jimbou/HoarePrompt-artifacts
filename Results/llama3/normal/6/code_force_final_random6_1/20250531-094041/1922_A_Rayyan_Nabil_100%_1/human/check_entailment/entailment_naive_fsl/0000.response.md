Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. The function func_1 checks for each character position if the characters in a and b are different from the character in c. If it finds such a position, it immediately returns 'YES'. If it doesn't find any such position after checking all characters, it returns 'NO'. This logic is correct according to the problem description.

The function func_2 reads the input, calls func_1 for each test case, and prints the results. It correctly handles the input and output format specified in the problem description.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
