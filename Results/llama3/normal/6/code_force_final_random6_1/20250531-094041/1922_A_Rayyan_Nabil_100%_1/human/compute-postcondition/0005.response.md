The only variable in the loop head is variable  `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1. So for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 0 and decreased by 1.
State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 2, `n` is a positive integer equal to the input integer, `a` is a string consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` and the new result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`, `stdin` is empty**
