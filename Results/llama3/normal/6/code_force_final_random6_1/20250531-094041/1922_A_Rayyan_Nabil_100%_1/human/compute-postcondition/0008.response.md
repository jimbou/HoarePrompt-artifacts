The only variable in the loop head is variable `result` and `results`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results`. If `results` has at least 1 result the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, t is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the `results` must have at least 1 result and the `result` is the first result in the list.
State: **`t` is 0, `n` is a positive integer equal to the input integer, `a` is a string consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for all iterations that must have at least 1 result, `result` is the first result in the list, `stdin` is empty**
