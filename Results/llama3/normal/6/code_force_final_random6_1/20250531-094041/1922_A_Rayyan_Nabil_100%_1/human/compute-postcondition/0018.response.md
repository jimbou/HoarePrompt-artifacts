Functionality: **The function reads a series of inputs from the user, where each input consists of a positive integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n` containing lowercase Latin letters. It then calls another function `func_1` with these inputs and stores the results in a list. After all inputs have been processed, the function prints each result in the list. The function does not modify the input variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, or `c`, and it does not perform any actions other than reading input, calling `func_1`, storing results, and printing output.**
