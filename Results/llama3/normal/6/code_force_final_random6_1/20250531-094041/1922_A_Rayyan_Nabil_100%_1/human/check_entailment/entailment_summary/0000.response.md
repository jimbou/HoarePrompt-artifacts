Reasoning: 
The given program is correct because it meets the problem description. The problem requires determining whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. The program uses two functions, func_1 and func_2, to achieve this.

func_1 compares three strings of equal length and returns 'YES' if it finds a position where both strings a and b differ from string c, otherwise it returns 'NO'. This function correctly implements the condition for the template t, where if the i-th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i.

func_2 reads a series of inputs from the user, calls func_1 with these inputs, stores the results in a list, and then prints each result in the list. This function correctly handles the input and output operations as described in the problem.

Since both functions work together to meet the problem description, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
