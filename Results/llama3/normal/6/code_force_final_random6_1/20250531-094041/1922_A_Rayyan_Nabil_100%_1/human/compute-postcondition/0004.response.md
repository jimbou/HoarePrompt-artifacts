Output State: **t is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, n is a positive integer equal to the input integer, a is a string consisting of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string consisting of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string consisting of n lowercase Latin letters, results is a list containing the result of func_1(n, a, b, c) and the new result of func_1(n, a, b, c), stdin is empty**

The code block first reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to n. Since stdin is empty, this operation does not affect the state of stdin. The value of n is updated to the input integer. The next three lines read strings from stdin and assign them to a, b, and c, respectively. Since stdin is empty, these operations do not affect the state of stdin. The values of a, b, and c are updated to the input strings. The last line appends the result of func_1(n, a, b, c) to the results list. The value of results is updated to include the new result. The value of t is not affected by the code block, so it remains greater than 0 and decreased by 1.
