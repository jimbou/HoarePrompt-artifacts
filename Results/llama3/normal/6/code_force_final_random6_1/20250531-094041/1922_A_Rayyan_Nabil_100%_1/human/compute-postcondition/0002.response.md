Output State: **t is greater than 0, n is a positive integer equal to the input integer, a is a string consisting of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string consisting of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string consisting of n lowercase Latin letters, results is a list containing the result of func_1(n, a, b, c), stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to the input integer from stdin, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are now strings consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters, as input from stdin. The `results` list now contains the result of the function `func_1` called with the updated values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`. Stdin is now empty, as all inputs have been consumed. The value of `t` remains unchanged, as it was not affected by the code.
