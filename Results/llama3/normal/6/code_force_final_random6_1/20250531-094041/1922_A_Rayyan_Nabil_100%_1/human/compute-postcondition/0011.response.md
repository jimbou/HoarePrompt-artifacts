The only object in the loop head is variable `result` and list `results`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results`.  If the list has at least 2 results the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `results` has at least 1 result, `result` is the first result in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 results and the `result` is the second result in the list.
State: **`t` is 0, `n` is a positive integer equal to the input integer, `a` is a string consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for all iterations that must have at least 2 results, `result` is the second result in the list, `stdin` is empty, and the second result in the list which is `result` is being printed**
