Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. The given program uses two functions: func_1 and func_2.

func_1 takes four parameters: n, a, b, and c. It iterates over the range of n and checks if the characters at the current index in strings a and b are not equal to the character at the same index in string c. If such a condition is found, it immediately returns 'YES'. If no such condition is found after iterating over the entire range, it returns 'NO'.

func_2 reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the length of the strings and the strings a, b, and c. It calls func_1 with these parameters and appends the result to the results list. Finally, it prints each result.

The given program is correct because it accurately implements the conditions specified in the problem. It checks if there exists a position where the characters in strings a and b are different from the character in string c, which is a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a template t that matches a and b but not c.

Correctness: **True**
