To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. In this case, the only variable in the loop head is `t`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be decreased by 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `n` is a positive integer equal to the input integer, `a` is a string consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`, `stdin` is empty**
