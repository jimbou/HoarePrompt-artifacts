Output State: **The program returns either -1 or the maximum value that can be obtained by performing a bitwise XOR operation between the initial value of `xor` and an element in the initial `cur_arr` that resulted in a 0 at the bit position `bit - 1`. The maximum value is obtained from the initial `cur_arr` which is an empty list, and the initial value of `xor` is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the initial value of `xor` and all elements in the initial `cur_arr`. The bit at position `bit` in `x` is 0, and `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30.**
