Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `new_arr` is an empty list, `xor` is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between 0 and the first element in `cur_arr`, `thing1` is 0, `i` is the first element in `cur_arr`.**

In this output state, the value of `xor` has been updated to be the result of the bitwise XOR operation between 0 and the first element in `cur_arr`. This means that `xor` now holds the value of the first element in `cur_arr`, since XORing any number with 0 results in the number itself. The other variables remain unchanged.
