Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `new_arr` is a list containing the result of the bitwise XOR operation between 0 and the first element in `cur_arr`, `xor` is 0, `thing1` is 0, `i` is the first element in `cur_arr`.**

In this output state, the only changes made by the code are to `new_arr` and `xor`. The first line of the code appends the value of `xor` to `new_arr`, and the second line sets `xor` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
