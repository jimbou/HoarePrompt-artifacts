Output State: **`cur_arr` is an empty list, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `thing1` is -1, `i` is the last element in the initial `cur_arr`, `new_arr` is a list containing the results of the bitwise XOR operations between the initial value of `xor` and each element in the initial `cur_arr` that resulted in a 0 at the bit position `bit`, and `xor` is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the initial value of `xor` and all elements in the initial `cur_arr`. The current value of `xor` has a 1 at the bit position `bit`.**

In this output state, the only change is that `thing1` is now -1, while all other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
