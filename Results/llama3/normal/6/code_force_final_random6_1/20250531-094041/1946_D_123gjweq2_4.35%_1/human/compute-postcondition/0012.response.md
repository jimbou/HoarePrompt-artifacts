Postcondition: ***`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `thing1` is 0, `i` is the second element in `cur_arr`. If the bit at position `bit` in the binary representation of `xor` is 0, then `xor` is set to 0 and `new_arr` is a list containing the bitwise XOR of its previous value and the second element in `cur_arr`.***
