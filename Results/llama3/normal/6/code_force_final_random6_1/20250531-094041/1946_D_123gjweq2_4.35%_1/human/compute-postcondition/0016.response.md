Postcondition: ***`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 3 elements, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `thing1` is 0, `i` is the third element in `cur_arr`. If the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the initial value of `xor` and the third element in `cur_arr` is 0 when shifted right by `bit` bits and masked with 1, then `xor` is 0 and `new_arr` is a list containing the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the initial value of `xor` and the third element in `cur_arr`.***
