You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

#State of the program right berfore the function call: cur_arr is a list of non-negative integers, bit is an integer such that -1 <= bit <= 30, and x is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30.
    if (bit == -1) :
        return len(cur_arr)
        #The program returns the number of non-negative integers in the list `cur_arr`.
    #State: *cur_arr is a list of non-negative integers, bit is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, and x is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30
    new_arr = []
    xor = 0
    thing1 = 0
    for i in cur_arr:
        xor ^= i
        
        if not xor >> bit & 1:
            new_arr.append(xor)
            xor = 0
        
    #State: `cur_arr` is an empty list, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `thing1` is 0, `i` is the last element in the initial `cur_arr`, `new_arr` is a list containing the results of the bitwise XOR operations between the initial value of `xor` and each element in the initial `cur_arr` that resulted in a 0 at the bit position `bit`, and `xor` is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the initial value of `xor` and all elements in the initial `cur_arr`.
    if (xor >> bit & 1) :
        thing1 = -1
    else :
        thing1 = find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)
    #State: *`cur_arr` is an empty list, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `i` is the last element in the initial `cur_arr`, `new_arr` is a list containing the results of the bitwise XOR operations between the initial value of `xor` and each element in the initial `cur_arr` that resulted in a 0 at the bit position `bit`, and `xor` is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the initial value of `xor` and all elements in the initial `cur_arr`. If the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 1, then `thing1` is -1. Otherwise, `thing1` is the maximum value that can be obtained by performing a bitwise XOR operation between the initial value of `xor` and an element in the initial `cur_arr` that resulted in a 0 at the bit position `bit - 1`.
    if (x >> bit & 1) :
        return max(find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1), len(new_arr))
        #The program returns the maximum value between the maximum value that can be obtained by performing a bitwise XOR operation between the initial value of `xor` and an element in the initial `cur_arr` that resulted in a 0 at the bit position `bit - 1` (which is either -1 if the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 1, or the maximum value that can be obtained by performing a bitwise XOR operation between the initial value of `xor` and an element in the initial `cur_arr` that resulted in a 0 at the bit position `bit - 1`), and the number of elements in the list `new_arr` that resulted in a 0 at the bit position `bit`.
    else :
        return thing1
        #The program returns either -1 or the maximum value that can be obtained by performing a bitwise XOR operation between the initial value of `xor` and an element in the initial `cur_arr` that resulted in a 0 at the bit position `bit - 1`. The maximum value is obtained from the initial `cur_arr` which is an empty list, and the initial value of `xor` is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the initial value of `xor` and all elements in the initial `cur_arr`. The bit at position `bit` in `x` is 0, and `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the number of non-negative integers in the list `cur_arr`.

Case_2: The program returns the maximum value between the maximum value that can be obtained by performing a bitwise XOR operation between the initial value of `xor` and an element in the initial `cur_arr` that resulted in a 0 at the bit position `bit - 1` (which is either -1 if the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 1, or the maximum value that can be obtained by performing a bitwise XOR operation between the initial value of `xor` and an element in the initial `cur_arr` that resulted in a 0 at the bit position `bit - 1`), and the number of elements in the list `new_arr` that resulted in a 0 at the bit position `bit`.

Case_3: The program returns either -1 or the maximum value that can be obtained by performing a bitwise XOR operation between the initial value of `xor` and an element in the initial `cur_arr` that resulted in a 0 at the bit position `bit - 1`. The maximum value is obtained from the initial `cur_arr` which is an empty list, and the initial value of `xor` is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the initial value of `xor` and all elements in the initial `cur_arr`. The bit at position `bit` in `x` is 0, and `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
