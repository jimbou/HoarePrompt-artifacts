Output State: **cur_arr is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, bit is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, x is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, thing1 is 0, i is the second element in cur_arr, xor is 0, new_arr is a list containing the bitwise XOR of its previous value and the second element in cur_arr.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line appends the value of `xor` to the list `new_arr`. Since `xor` is the bitwise XOR of its previous value and the second element in `cur_arr`, this operation adds a new element to `new_arr` that is the result of this XOR operation. The second line resets the value of `xor` to 0.

After executing the code, the values of `cur_arr`, `bit`, `x`, `thing1`, and `i` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The value of `xor` is reset to 0, and a new element is added to `new_arr` as described above.
