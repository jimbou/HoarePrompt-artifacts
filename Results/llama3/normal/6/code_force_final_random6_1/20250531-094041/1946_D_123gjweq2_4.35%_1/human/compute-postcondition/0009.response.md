The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and list `cur_arr`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cur_arr`. If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `cur_arr` has at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `cur_arr`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the `i` is the second element in the list.
State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `thing1` is 0, `i` is the second element in `cur_arr`.**
