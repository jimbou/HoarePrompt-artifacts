Postcondition: ***`cur_arr` is an empty list, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `i` is the last element in the initial `cur_arr`, `new_arr` is a list containing the results of the bitwise XOR operations between the initial value of `xor` and each element in the initial `cur_arr` that resulted in a 0 at the bit position `bit`, and `xor` is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the initial value of `xor` and all elements in the initial `cur_arr`. If the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 1, then `thing1` is -1. Otherwise, `thing1` is the maximum value that can be obtained by performing a bitwise XOR operation between the initial value of `xor` and an element in the initial `cur_arr` that resulted in a 0 at the bit position `bit - 1`. The bit at position `bit` in `x` is 0.***
