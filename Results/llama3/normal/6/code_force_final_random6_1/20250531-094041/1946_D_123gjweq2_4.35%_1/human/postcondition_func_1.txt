This function calculates the maximum value that can be obtained by performing a bitwise XOR operation between a given non-negative integer `x` and a list of non-negative integers `cur_arr`. It takes into account the bit position `bit` and returns either the number of non-negative integers in `cur_arr`, the maximum value that can be obtained by performing a bitwise XOR operation between `x` and an element in `cur_arr` that resulted in a 0 at the bit position `bit - 1`, or the number of elements in the list `new_arr` that resulted in a 0 at the bit position `bit`. If the bit at position `bit` in `x` is 0, it returns either -1 or the maximum value that can be obtained by performing a bitwise XOR operation between `x` and an element in `cur_arr` that resulted in a 0 at the bit position `bit - 1`.
