Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum number of segments in an array such that the bitwise XOR of the elements in each segment is less than or equal to a given number x. The segments must be non-overlapping and cover the entire array.

The provided code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `find_max`. `func_1` simply calls `find_max` with the input array and the value 31.

`find_max` is a recursive function that works by iterating over the input array and performing a bitwise XOR operation on the elements. It keeps track of the current XOR value and the maximum value that can be obtained by performing a bitwise XOR operation between the current XOR value and an element in the array that resulted in a 0 at the current bit position.

The function uses a recursive approach to explore all possible segments in the array. It returns the maximum value that can be obtained by performing a bitwise XOR operation between the current XOR value and an element in the array that resulted in a 0 at the current bit position, or the number of elements in the list `new_arr` that resulted in a 0 at the current bit position.

The function also takes into account the bit position `bit` and the value `x`. If the bit at position `bit` in `x` is 0, it returns either -1 or the maximum value that can be obtained by performing a bitwise XOR operation between `x` and an element in the array that resulted in a 0 at the bit position `bit - 1`.

The function correctly implements the problem's requirements and returns the maximum number of segments in the array such that the bitwise XOR of the elements in each segment is less than or equal to the given number x.

Correctness: **True**
