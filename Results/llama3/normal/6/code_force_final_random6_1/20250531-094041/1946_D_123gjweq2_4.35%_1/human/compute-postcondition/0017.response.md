Output State: **`cur_arr` is an empty list, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `thing1` is 0, `i` is the last element in the initial `cur_arr`, `new_arr` is a list containing the results of the bitwise XOR operations between the initial value of `xor` and each element in the initial `cur_arr` that resulted in a 0 at the bit position `bit`, and `xor` is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the initial value of `xor` and all elements in the initial `cur_arr`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all iterations, the list `cur_arr` will be empty because all its elements have been processed. The values of `bit`, `x`, and `thing1` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop. The variable `i` will hold the value of the last element in the initial `cur_arr` because it is the last element processed by the loop. The list `new_arr` will contain the results of the bitwise XOR operations between the initial value of `xor` and each element in the initial `cur_arr` that resulted in a 0 at the bit position `bit`. The variable `xor` will hold the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the initial value of `xor` and all elements in the initial `cur_arr`.
