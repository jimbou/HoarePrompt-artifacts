To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the given state.

The loop head is `for i in cur_arr:`, which means we're iterating over the elements of `cur_arr`. The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which takes on the value of each element in `cur_arr` during each iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

* `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements.
* `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30.
* `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30.
* `thing1` is 0.
* `i` is the second element in `cur_arr`.

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to consider what happens when the loop iterates over the next element in `cur_arr`. Since `i` is the second element in `cur_arr`, the next iteration will assign the third element of `cur_arr` to `i`.

The other variables (`bit`, `x`, and `thing1`) are not affected by the loop iteration, as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 3 elements, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `thing1` is 0, `i` is the third element in `cur_arr`.**

Note that we've updated the state of `cur_arr` to reflect that it must have at least 3 elements, since we're iterating over the third element in the next iteration.
