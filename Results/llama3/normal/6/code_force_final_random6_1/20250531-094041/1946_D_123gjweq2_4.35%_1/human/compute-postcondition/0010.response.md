Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `thing1` is 0, `i` is the second element in `cur_arr`, `xor` is the bitwise XOR of its previous value and the second element in `cur_arr`.**

In this output state, the value of `xor` has been updated to be the bitwise XOR of its previous value and the second element in `cur_arr`, which is `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.
