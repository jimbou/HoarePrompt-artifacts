Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between the maximum value that can be obtained by performing a bitwise XOR operation between the initial value of `xor` and an element in the initial `cur_arr` that resulted in a 0 at the bit position `bit - 1` (which is either -1 if the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 1, or the maximum value that can be obtained by performing a bitwise XOR operation between the initial value of `xor` and an element in the initial `cur_arr` that resulted in a 0 at the bit position `bit - 1`), and the number of elements in the list `new_arr` that resulted in a 0 at the bit position `bit`.**

In simpler terms, the program returns the maximum value between the maximum XOR value that can be obtained by flipping the bit at position `bit - 1` (if possible) and the number of elements in the list `new_arr` that have a 0 at the bit position `bit`.
