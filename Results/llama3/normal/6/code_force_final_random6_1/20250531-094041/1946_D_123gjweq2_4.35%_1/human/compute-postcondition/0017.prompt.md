Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: cur_arr is a list of non-negative integers, bit is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, x is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, new_arr is an empty list, xor is 0, thing1 is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in cur_arr:
    xor ^= i
    if not xor >> bit & 1:
        new_arr.append(xor)
        xor = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `thing1` is 0, `i` is the first element in `cur_arr`. If the result of the bitwise XOR operation between 0 and the first element in `cur_arr` is 0 at the bit position `bit`, then `new_arr` is a list containing the result of the bitwise XOR operation between 0 and the first element in `cur_arr` and `xor` is 0. Otherwise, no changes are made to `new_arr` and `xor`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `thing1` is 0, `i` is the second element in `cur_arr`. If the bit at position `bit` in the binary representation of `xor` is 0, then `xor` is set to 0 and `new_arr` is a list containing the bitwise XOR of its previous value and the second element in `cur_arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 3 elements, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `thing1` is 0, `i` is the third element in `cur_arr`. If the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the initial value of `xor` and the third element in `cur_arr` is 0 when shifted right by `bit` bits and masked with 1, then `xor` is 0 and `new_arr` is a list containing the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the initial value of `xor` and the third element in `cur_arr`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
