Output State: **cur_arr is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 3 elements, bit is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, x is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, thing1 is 0, i is the third element in cur_arr, xor is 0, new_arr is a list containing the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the initial value of xor and the third element in cur_arr.**

In this output state, the code has appended the initial value of `xor` to `new_arr`, and then reset `xor` to 0. The values of `cur_arr`, `bit`, `x`, `thing1`, and `i` remain unchanged, as they were not modified by the code. The only changes are the addition of the initial `xor` value to `new_arr` and the resetting of `xor` to 0.
