According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num2`. If `num2` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `num2` is an integer such that 2 <= num2 <= 100, so it needs to be adjusted to `num2` is greater than 1 and `i` is now 1.

State: **`a` is a list of integers, `num2` is an integer such that 2 <= num2 <= 100, `len(a)` equals `num2`, all elements in `a` are between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `order` is 0, `i` is 1, `num2` must be greater than 1**
