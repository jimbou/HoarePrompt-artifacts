Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `num2` is an integer such that 2 <= num2 <= 100, `len(a)` equals `num2`, all elements in `a` are between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), and `order` is 0.**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `num2` remain unchanged, and the length of `a` is still equal to `num2`. All elements in `a` are still between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). Additionally, a new variable `order` is introduced and initialized to 0.
