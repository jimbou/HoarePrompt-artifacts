The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and num2, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `num2`. If `i` is less than `num2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `num2` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `num2` must be greater than 2.
State: **`a` is a list of integers, `num2` is an integer such that 2 < num2 <= 100, `len(a)` equals `num2`, all elements in `a` are between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `num2` must be greater than 2. If the current value of `a[i - 1]` is greater than or equal to the current value of `a[i]`, then `order` is 1. Otherwise, `order` remains 0.**
