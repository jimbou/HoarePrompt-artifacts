Functionality: **This function checks if a given list of integers is sorted in ascending order. It accepts a list 'a' and an integer 'num2' as parameters, where 'num2' represents the length of the list. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the list is sorted in ascending order. If the list is sorted, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False. The function assumes that the input list contains integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) and that the length of the list is between 2 and 100 (inclusive).**
