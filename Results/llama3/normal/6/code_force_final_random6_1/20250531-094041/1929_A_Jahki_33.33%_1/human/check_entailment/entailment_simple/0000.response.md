Reasoning: The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The program takes the number of test cases and the length of the array as inputs, followed by the elements of the array. It then checks if the array is already sorted in ascending order using the function `func_1(a, num2)`. If the array is sorted, it prints 0 as the maximum beauty. Otherwise, it sorts the array in ascending order and calculates the maximum beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements.

The function `func_1(a, num2)` checks if the array is sorted by iterating through the elements and counting the number of times the previous element is greater than or equal to the current element. If this count is 0, it means the array is sorted, and the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. The use of the `sorted()` function to sort the array in ascending order is efficient, and the calculation of the maximum beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements is accurate.

Correctness: **True**
