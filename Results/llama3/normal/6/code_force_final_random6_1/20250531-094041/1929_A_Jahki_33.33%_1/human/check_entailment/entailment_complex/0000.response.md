Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

The program first reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the elements of the array. It then checks if the array is already sorted in ascending order using the `func_1` function. If the array is sorted, it prints 0 as the maximum beauty. Otherwise, it sorts the array in ascending order and calculates the maximum beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements.

The `func_1` function checks if the array is sorted in ascending order by iterating over the elements and checking if each element is greater than or equal to the previous element. If all elements are in ascending order, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

The program assumes that the input array contains integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) and that the length of the array is between 2 and 100 (inclusive).

Based on the problem description and the execution states of the program, the program is correct. It correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the elements in ascending order and summing the differences between consecutive elements. The `func_1` function correctly checks if the array is already sorted in ascending order.

Correctness: **True**
