Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The program uses a helper function `func_1` to check if the input array is already sorted in ascending order. If the array is sorted, the program prints 0 as the maximum beauty. Otherwise, it sorts the array in ascending order and calculates the maximum beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. The `func_1` function correctly checks if the input array is sorted in ascending order, and the main program correctly calculates the maximum beauty by sorting the array and summing the differences between consecutive elements.

However, there is a minor issue with the program. The `func_1` function is not necessary, and the program can be simplified by removing it. The main program can directly sort the array and calculate the maximum beauty without checking if the array is already sorted.

Correctness: **True**
