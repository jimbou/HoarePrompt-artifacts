Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

2. The given program first reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the length of the array and the elements of the array.

3. The program defines a function `func_1` that checks if the array is already sorted in ascending order. If the array is already sorted, the function returns `True`, otherwise, it returns `False`.

4. If the array is already sorted, the program prints `0` as the beauty of the array. Otherwise, it sorts the array in ascending order and calculates the beauty of the array by summing the differences between consecutive elements.

5. The program then prints the calculated beauty of the array.

6. The program correctly handles the case where the array is already sorted and the case where the array needs to be sorted.

7. The program correctly calculates the beauty of the array by summing the differences between consecutive elements.

8. The program does not have any syntax errors or logical errors.

9. The program correctly handles the input and output as described in the problem statement.

10. The program correctly solves the problem as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
