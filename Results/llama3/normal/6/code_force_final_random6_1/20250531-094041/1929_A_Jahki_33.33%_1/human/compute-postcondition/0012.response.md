Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers, `num2` is an integer such that 2 <= num2 <= 100, `len(a)` equals `num2`, all elements in `a` are between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is `num2 - 1`, and the current value of `order` is 0, meaning that for all `i` ranging from 1 to `num2 - 1`, the value of `a[i - 1]` is strictly less than the value of `a[i]`.***
