Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers, `num2` is an integer such that 2 <= num2 <= 100, `len(a)` equals `num2`, all elements in `a` are between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `num2` must be greater than 1. If the current value of `a[i - 1]` is greater than or equal to the current value of `a[i]`, then `order` is 1. Otherwise, `order` remains 0.***
