Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `num2` is an integer such that 2 < num2 <= 100, `len(a)` equals `num2`, all elements in `a` are between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is 3, `num2` must be greater than 3. If the current value of `a[i - 1]` is greater than or equal to the current value of `a[i]`, then `order` is 3. Otherwise, `order` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `order` has been incremented by 1. If the current value of `a[i - 1]` is greater than or equal to the current value of `a[i]`, then `order` is now 3. Otherwise, `order` is now 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
