Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` is not necessary and is actually causing the program to produce incorrect results. The function is checking if the array is already sorted in ascending order, and if it is, the program prints 0. However, this is not what the problem description asks for. The problem description asks for the maximum beauty of the array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements in any way.

A case where the program does not work correctly is when the input array is already sorted in ascending order, but the maximum beauty can be obtained by rearranging the elements in a different way. For example, if the input array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the program will print 0, but the maximum beauty can be obtained by rearranging the elements to [5, 1, 2, 3, 4], which has a beauty of 9.

The correct solution is to simply sort the array in ascending order and then calculate the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements. The program should not use the `func_1` function and should always calculate the beauty, regardless of whether the array is already sorted or not.
