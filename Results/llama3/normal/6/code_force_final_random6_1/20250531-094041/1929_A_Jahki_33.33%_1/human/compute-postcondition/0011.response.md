Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `num2` is an integer such that 2 <= num2 <= 100, `len(a)` equals `num2`, all elements in `a` are between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is `num2 - 1`, `order` is the number of times the value of `a[i - 1]` is greater than or equal to the value of `a[i]` for `i` ranging from 1 to `num2 - 1`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `a` and the integer `num2` remain unchanged, but the variable `i` now holds the value of `num2 - 1`. The variable `order` now holds the total count of times the value of `a[i - 1]` is greater than or equal to the value of `a[i]` for all iterations of the loop.
