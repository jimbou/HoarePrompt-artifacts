You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers and num2 is an integer such that 2 <= num2 <= 100 and len(a) == num2 and all(1 <= x <= 10^9 for x in a).
    order = 0
    for i in range(1, num2):
        if a[i - 1] >= a[i]:
            order += 1
        
    #State: `a` is a list of integers, `num2` is an integer such that 2 <= num2 <= 100, `len(a)` equals `num2`, all elements in `a` are between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is `num2 - 1`, `order` is the number of times the value of `a[i - 1]` is greater than or equal to the value of `a[i]` for `i` ranging from 1 to `num2 - 1`.
    if (order == 0) :
        return True
        #The program returns a boolean value of True, indicating that the list 'a' is sorted in ascending order, with all elements being between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), and the length of 'a' is equal to 'num2', which is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive).
    else :
        return False
        #The program returns False

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns a boolean value of True, indicating that the list 'a' is sorted in ascending order, with all elements being between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), and the length of 'a' is equal to 'num2', which is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive).

Case_2: The program returns False


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
