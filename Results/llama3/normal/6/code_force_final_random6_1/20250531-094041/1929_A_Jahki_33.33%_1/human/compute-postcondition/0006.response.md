Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `num2` is an integer such that 2 < num2 <= 100, `len(a)` equals `num2`, all elements in `a` are between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `num2` must be greater than 2. If the current value of `a[i - 1]` is greater than or equal to the current value of `a[i]`, then `order` is 2. Otherwise, `order` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `order` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The length of `a` is still equal to `num2`, and all elements in `a` are still between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). The value of `i` is still 2, and `num2` is still greater than 2. The condition for `order` has been updated to reflect the incremented value.
