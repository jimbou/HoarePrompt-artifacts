Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `num2` is an integer such that 2 <= num2 <= 100, `len(a)` equals `num2`, all elements in `a` are between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `order` is 1, `i` is 1, `num2` must be greater than 1. The current value of `a[i - 1]` is greater than or equal to the current value of `a[i]`.**

In this output state, the value of `order` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The values of the other variables remain the same. The list `a` still contains integers, `num2` is still between 2 and 100, and the length of `a` is still equal to `num2`. All elements in `a` are still between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). The value of `i` is still 1, and `num2` is still greater than 1. The relationship between the elements of `a` at indices `i-1` and `i` remains the same, with `a[i-1]` being greater than or equal to `a[i]`.
