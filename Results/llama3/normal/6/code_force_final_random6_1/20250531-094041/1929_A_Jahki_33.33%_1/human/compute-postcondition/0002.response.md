Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers, `num2` is an integer such that 2 <= num2 <= 100, `len(a)` equals `num2`, all elements in `a` are between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `order` is 0, `i` is 1, `num2` must be greater than 1. The current value of `a[i - 1]` is greater than or equal to the current value of `a[i]`.**
