#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers and num2 is an integer such that 2 <= num2 <= 100 and len(a) == num2 and all(1 <= x <= 10^9 for x in a).
    order = 0
    for i in range(1, num2):
        if a[i - 1] >= a[i]:
            order += 1
        
    #State: `a` is a list of integers, `num2` is an integer such that 2 <= num2 <= 100, `len(a)` equals `num2`, all elements in `a` are between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is `num2 - 1`, `order` is the number of times the value of `a[i - 1]` is greater than or equal to the value of `a[i]` for `i` ranging from 1 to `num2 - 1`.
    if (order == 0) :
        return True
        #The program returns a boolean value of True, indicating that the list 'a' is sorted in ascending order, with all elements being between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), and the length of 'a' is equal to 'num2', which is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive).
    else :
        return False
        #The program returns False

#Overall this is what the function does:This function checks if a given list of integers is sorted in ascending order. It accepts a list 'a' and an integer 'num2' as parameters, where 'num2' represents the length of the list. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the list is sorted in ascending order. If the list is sorted, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False. The function assumes that the input list contains integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) and that the length of the list is between 2 and 100 (inclusive).
