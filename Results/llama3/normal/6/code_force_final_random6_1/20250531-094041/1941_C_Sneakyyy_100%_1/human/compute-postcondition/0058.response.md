The variables in the loop head are `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `len(a) - 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4 if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `i` is 2, and `a` is a string equal to the next input and must be at least 4 characters long if `i` is 1 or 2, or `a` is at least 5 characters long if `i` is 3 or 4. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(a) - 2`, so `a` must be at least 6 characters long if `i` is 4, or `a` must be at least 5 characters long if `i` is 2.

State: **`n` is an integer equal to the next input, `a` is a string equal to the next input and must be at least 6 characters long if `i` is 4, or `a` is at least 5 characters long if `i` is 2, `s` is a string of length 3 and is equal to the substring of `a` starting at index `i` and ending at index `i + 2` if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', or `s` is a string of length 3 and is equal to the substring of `a` starting at index `i-1` and ending at index `i + 1` if `s` is not 'map' or 'pie', `i` is 4 if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `i` is 2, `ans` is 1 if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2.**
