Output State: **n is an integer, a is a string, ans is 0, i is 0, _ is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 1.**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since stdin contains at least 1 test case, `n` becomes an integer. The second line assigns a string value from the input to `a`. The third line initializes `ans` to 0. The fourth line initializes `i` to 0. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0. Stdin now contains at least 1 test case minus 1.
