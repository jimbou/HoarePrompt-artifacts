To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable that takes the value of the current iteration. The loop will execute as long as there are more inputs to read.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:

* `n` is an integer equal to the first input
* `a` is a string equal to the second input
* `ans` is equal to the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in `a`
* `i` is equal to the length of `a`
* `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2
* The number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in `a` is being printed, which is equal to `ans`

To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the following:

* `_` is a throwaway variable, so its value is not important.
* The loop will execute as long as there are more inputs to read. Since `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2, we can assume that there is at least one more test case to read.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is an integer equal to the next input, `a` is a string equal to the next input, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 1**

Note that we reset `ans` and `i` to 0, as they are specific to the previous iteration and do not carry over to the next iteration. We also decrement the number of test cases in `stdin` by 1, as we have already processed one test case.
