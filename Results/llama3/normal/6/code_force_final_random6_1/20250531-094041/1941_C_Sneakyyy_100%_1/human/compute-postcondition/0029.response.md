Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `a` is a string equal to the second input and has a length of at least 3, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1, `_` is 1, `s` is a substring of `a` starting at index `i` with a length of 3, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2, and the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in `a` is not being printed. Additionally, the substring `s` is neither 'map' nor 'pie'.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, and the substring `s` now starts at index `i` with a length of 3. The other variables remain unchanged.
