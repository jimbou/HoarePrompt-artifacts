The code snippet provided assigns the integer value of the input to `n`, the string value of the input to `a`, and resets the values of `ans` and `i` to 0. 

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `n` was equal to the next input, `n` is now an integer equal to the next input. The second line assigns the string value of the input to `a`. Since `a` was equal to the next input, `a` is now a string equal to the next input. The third line resets the value of `ans` to 0. The fourth line resets the value of `i` to 0.

Output State: **n is an integer equal to the next input, a is a string equal to the next input, ans is 0, i is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2**
