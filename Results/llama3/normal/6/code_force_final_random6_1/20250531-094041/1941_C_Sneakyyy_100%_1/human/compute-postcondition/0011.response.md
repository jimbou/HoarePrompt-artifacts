Output State: **n is an integer, a is a string with a length of at least 4, ans is either 1 or 2, i is 4, _ is 0, s is a substring of a with a length of 3 starting from index 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 1. If s is either 'map' or 'pie', then ans is 2 and i is 6. Otherwise, ans is 1 and i is 4.**

The code increments `i` by 3, making it 4, and increments `ans` by 1. The value of `ans` is either 1 or 2, depending on its initial value. The value of `i` is 4, unless `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', in which case `i` is 6 and `ans` is 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
