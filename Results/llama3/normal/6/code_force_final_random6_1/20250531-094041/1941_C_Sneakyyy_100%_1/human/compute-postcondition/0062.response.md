Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer equal to the next input, `a` is a string equal to the next input and must be at least 6 characters long if `i` is 7, or `a` is at least 5 characters long if `i` is 5 or 3, `s` is a string of length 3 and is equal to the substring of `a` starting at index `i - 3` and ending at index `i` if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', or starting at index `i-1` and ending at index `i + 1` if `s` is not 'map' or 'pie', `i` is 7 if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `i` is 5 if `s` is not 'map' or 'pie' but was 'map' or 'pie' in the previous iteration, otherwise `i` is 3, `ans` is 2 if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 1 if `s` was 'map' or 'pie' in the previous iteration, otherwise `ans` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2.***
