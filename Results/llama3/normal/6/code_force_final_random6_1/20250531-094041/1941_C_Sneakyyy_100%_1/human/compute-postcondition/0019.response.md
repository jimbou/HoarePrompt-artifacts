Output State: **n is an integer, a is a string, ans is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in a, i is equal to len(a) - 2, _ is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `ans` will hold the count of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in the string `a`. The variable `i` will be equal to the length of `a` minus 2, indicating that the loop has traversed the entire string. The other variables remain unchanged.
