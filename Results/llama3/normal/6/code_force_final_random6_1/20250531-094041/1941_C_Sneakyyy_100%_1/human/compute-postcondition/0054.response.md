Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the next input, `a` is a string equal to the next input and must be at least 4 characters long if `i` is 1, or `a` is at least 5 characters long if `i` is 3, `s` is a string of length 3 and is equal to the substring of `a` starting at index `i` and ending at index `i + 2`, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 3. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to be a substring of `a` starting at index `i` and ending at index `i + 2`. The other variables remain unchanged. The length of `s` is still 3, but its value is now dependent on the value of `i` and the string `a`. The conditions for `ans` and `i` remain the same, but the value of `s` may have changed, which could affect the values of `ans` and `i`.
