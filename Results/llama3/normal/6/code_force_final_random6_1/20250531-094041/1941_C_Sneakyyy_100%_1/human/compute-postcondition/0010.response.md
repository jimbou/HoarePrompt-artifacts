Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a string with a length of at least 4, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 1, `_` is 0, `s` is a substring of `a` with a length of 3 starting from index `i`, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 1. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 3. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s` is updated to be a substring of `a` with a length of 3, starting from the current index `i`. The values of other variables remain the same. The relationship between `s`, `ans`, and `i` is still maintained, meaning that if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 3, otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 1.
