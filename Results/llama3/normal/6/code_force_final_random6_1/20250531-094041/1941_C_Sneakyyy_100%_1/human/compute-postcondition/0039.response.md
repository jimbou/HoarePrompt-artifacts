Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `a` is a string equal to the second input and has a length greater than 6, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2, `s` is a substring of `a` starting at index `i` with a length of 3, if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 5. Otherwise, `ans` is either 0 or 1 and `i` is 3**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is now 5. Otherwise, `ans` is either 0 or 1 and `i` is now 3. The values of the other variables remain the same.
