The variable in the loop head is `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `len(a) - 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 or 1, `a` has a length of at least 3. For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must be less than `len(a) - 2`, so `i` must be less than or equal to `len(a) - 3`. Since `i` is 3 or 1, `i` must be 1 and `a` must have a length of at least 4.
State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `a` is a string equal to the second input and has a length of at least 4, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2, and the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in `a` is not being printed. If the substring `s` of `a` starting at index `i` with a length of 3 is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 1. In both cases, `_` is 1.**
