Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the next input, `a` is a string equal to the next input and must be at least 6 characters long if `i` is 4, or `a` is at least 5 characters long if `i` is 2, `s` is a string of length 3 and is equal to the substring of `a` starting at index `i` and ending at index `i + 2`, `i` is 4 if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `i` is 2, `ans` is 1 if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to be a substring of `a` starting at index `i` and ending at index `i + 2`. The values of `n`, `a`, `i`, and `ans` remain the same as in the initial state. The length of `a` is still constrained to be at least 6 characters long if `i` is 4, or at least 5 characters long if `i` is 2. The value of `i` is still dependent on the value of `s`, and the value of `ans` is still dependent on the value of `s`. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 2.
