Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first input, a is a string equal to the second input, ans is equal to the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in a, i is equal to the length of a, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2, and the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in a is not being printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the variable `n` remains unchanged as an integer equal to the first input, `a` remains unchanged as a string equal to the second input, `ans` is now equal to the total number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in string `a`, `i` is now equal to the length of string `a`, and `stdin` still contains at least 1 test case minus 2. The number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in `a` is still not being printed.
