Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself.
3. It initializes a counter `ans` to 0, which will store the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.
4. It uses a while loop to iterate over the string `s` with a sliding window of size 3 (since the substrings 'map' and 'pie' are of length 3).
5. Inside the loop, it checks if the current window matches either 'map' or 'pie'. If it does, it increments the counter `ans` by 1 (since we need to delete at least one character to make the string beautiful) and moves the window 3 characters forward. If it doesn't match, it simply moves the window 1 character forward.
6. After processing the entire string, it prints the value of `ans`, which represents the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, processing all test cases and printing the correct output for each case.

Correctness: **True**
