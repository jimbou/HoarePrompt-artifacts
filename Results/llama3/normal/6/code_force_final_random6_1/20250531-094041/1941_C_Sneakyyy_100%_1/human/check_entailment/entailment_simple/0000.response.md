Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It iterates through the input string `a` with a sliding window of size 3, checking for the substrings "map" and "pie". If either substring is found, it increments the counter `ans` and moves the window 3 positions forward. If not, it moves the window 1 position forward. This ensures that all non-overlapping occurrences of "map" and "pie" are counted.

The program correctly handles the case where the input string is already beautiful (i.e., does not contain "map" or "pie") by printing 0.

The time complexity of the program is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, which is acceptable given the constraints of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
