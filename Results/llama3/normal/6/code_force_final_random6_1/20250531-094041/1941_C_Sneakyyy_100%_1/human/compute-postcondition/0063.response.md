Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the next input, `a` is a string equal to the next input, `ans` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in `a`, `i` is equal to `len(a) - 2`, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `n` remains unchanged, the variable `a` remains unchanged, the variable `ans` is the count of non-overlapping occurrences of the strings 'map' or 'pie' in the string `a`, the variable `i` is equal to the length of the string `a` minus 2, and the standard input contains at least 1 test case minus 2.
