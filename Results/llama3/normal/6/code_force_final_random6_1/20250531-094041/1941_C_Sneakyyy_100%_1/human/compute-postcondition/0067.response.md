Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a string s of length n. It then counts the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in each string and prints the count for each test case. The function processes all test cases and empties the standard input.**
