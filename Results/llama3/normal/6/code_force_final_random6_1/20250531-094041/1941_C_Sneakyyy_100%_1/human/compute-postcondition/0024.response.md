To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to examine the condition `i < len(a) - 2`. This condition depends on the values of `i` and `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer equal to the first input,
- `a` is a string equal to the second input,
- `ans` is 0,
- `i` is 0,
- `_` is 1,
- `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2,
- The number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in `a` is not being printed.

The loop condition `i < len(a) - 2` requires that `i` is less than the length of `a` minus 2. Since `i` is initially 0, we need to ensure that `len(a)` is at least 3 to satisfy the condition for the first iteration.

Therefore, the state of `a` needs to be adjusted to ensure it has a length of at least 3.

State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `a` is a string equal to the second input and has a length of at least 3, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2, and the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in `a` is not being printed.**
