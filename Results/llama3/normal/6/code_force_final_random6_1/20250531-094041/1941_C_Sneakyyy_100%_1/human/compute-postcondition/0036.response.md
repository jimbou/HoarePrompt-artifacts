The variables in the loop head are `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of `a`. If `i` is less than `len(a) - 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 2 or 4, and `a` has a length of at least 4. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(a) - 2`, so `len(a)` must be greater than `i + 2`. Since `i` is either 2 or 4, `len(a)` must be greater than 4 or 6, respectively. Therefore, `len(a)` must be greater than 6.

State: **n is an integer equal to the first input, a is a string equal to the second input and has a length greater than 6, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2, s is a substring of a starting at index 1 with a length of 3, if s is either 'map' or 'pie', then ans is 1 and i is 4. Otherwise, ans is either 0 or 1 and i is 2**
