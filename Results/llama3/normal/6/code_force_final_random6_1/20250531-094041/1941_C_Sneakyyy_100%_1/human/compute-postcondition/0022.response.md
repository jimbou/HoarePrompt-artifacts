The only variable in the loop head is variable  _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than int(input()), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 1. For the loop to execute again _ is increased by 1 so _ is 1 and for the loop to execute again stdin must contain at least 1 test case minus 1 minus 1.
State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a string, `ans` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in `a`, `i` is equal to `len(a) - 2`, `_` is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 1 minus 1, and the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in `a` which is `ans` is being printed**
