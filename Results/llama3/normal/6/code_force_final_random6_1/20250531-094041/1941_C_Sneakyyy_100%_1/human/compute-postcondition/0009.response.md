The variables in the loop head are `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `len(a) - 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 1 or 3, and `a` has a length of at least 3. However, if `i` is 3, it is not guaranteed that the loop will execute again, because `len(a) - 2` could be 3 or less. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to be less than `len(a) - 2`. Since `i` is either 1 or 3, we can adjust `i` to be 1. Additionally, we need to ensure that `len(a) - 2` is greater than 1, so we can adjust `a` to have a length of at least 4.

State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a string with a length of at least 4, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 1, `_` is 0, `s` is a substring of `a` with a length of 3 starting from index 0, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 1. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 3. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 1.**
