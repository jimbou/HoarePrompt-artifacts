According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `len(a) - 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 1 or 3, and `a` is at least 3 characters long. However, `a` being at least 3 characters long does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `a` is at least 4 characters long if `i` is 1, or `a` is at least 5 characters long if `i` is 3. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer equal to the next input, `a` is a string equal to the next input and must be at least 4 characters long if `i` is 1, or `a` is at least 5 characters long if `i` is 3, `s` is a string of length 3 and is equal to the first 3 characters of `a`, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 3. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 1.**
