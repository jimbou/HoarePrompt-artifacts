Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer equal to the next input, a is a string equal to the next input, ans is 0, i is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a) - 2:
    s = a[i:i + 3]
    if s == 'map' or s == 'pie':
        i += 3
        ans += 1
    else:
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer equal to the next input, `a` is a string equal to the next input and must be at least 3 characters long, `s` is a string of length 3 and is equal to the first 3 characters of `a`, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 3. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`n` is an integer equal to the next input, `a` is a string equal to the next input and must be at least 4 characters long if `i` is 1 or 2, or `a` is at least 5 characters long if `i` is 3 or 4, `s` is a string of length 3 and is equal to the substring of `a` starting at index `i` and ending at index `i + 2` if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', or `s` is a string of length 3 and is equal to the substring of `a` starting at index `i-1` and ending at index `i + 1` if `s` is not 'map' or 'pie', `i` is 4 if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `i` is 2, `ans` is 1 if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`n` is an integer equal to the next input, `a` is a string equal to the next input and must be at least 6 characters long if `i` is 7, or `a` is at least 5 characters long if `i` is 5 or 3, `s` is a string of length 3 and is equal to the substring of `a` starting at index `i - 3` and ending at index `i` if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', or starting at index `i-1` and ending at index `i + 1` if `s` is not 'map' or 'pie', `i` is 7 if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `i` is 5 if `s` is not 'map' or 'pie' but was 'map' or 'pie' in the previous iteration, otherwise `i` is 3, `ans` is 2 if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 1 if `s` was 'map' or 'pie' in the previous iteration, otherwise `ans` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
