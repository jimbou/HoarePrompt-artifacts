Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the next input, `a` is a string equal to the next input and must be at least 3 characters long, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `s` is a string of length 3 and is equal to the first 3 characters of `a`, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains the same as it was equal to the next input, the value of `a` remains the same as it was equal to the next input and must be at least 3 characters long, the value of `ans` remains 0, the value of `i` remains 0, a new variable `s` is created which is a string of length 3 and is equal to the first 3 characters of `a`, and the stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 2.
