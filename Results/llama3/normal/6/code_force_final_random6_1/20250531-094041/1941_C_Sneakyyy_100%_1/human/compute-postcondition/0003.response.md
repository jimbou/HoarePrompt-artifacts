The code assigns a substring of `a` to `s`, starting from the index `i` and ending at `i + 3`. Since `a` has a length of at least 3, this substring is guaranteed to exist.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a string with a length of at least 3, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `_` is 0, `s` is a substring of `a` with a length of 3 starting from index 0, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 1.**
