To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the variable `_` and the input from `stdin`. The loop will execute as long as there is at least one test case in the input. Therefore, the state of the input from `stdin` must be adjusted to have at least one test case.

State: **stdin contains at least 1 test case, `_` is 0**
