Output State: **n is an integer, a is a string with a length of at least 7, ans is either 1, 2, or 3, i is either 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, _ is 0, s is a substring of a with a length of 3 starting from index i, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 1. If s is either 'map' or 'pie', then ans is 2 and i is 6. If s is either 'map' or 'pie' but ans was originally 1, then ans is 2 and i is 4. If s is either 'map' or 'pie' but ans was originally 0, then ans is 1 and i is 3. If s is not 'map' or 'pie' but ans was originally 1, then ans is 1 and i is 4. If s is not 'map' or 'pie' but ans was originally 0, then ans is 0 and i is 2.**

The code increments `i` by 3 and `ans` by 1. The value of `i` is either 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, so after incrementing by 3, it becomes either 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. The value of `ans` is either 0, 1, or 2, so after incrementing by 1, it becomes either 1, 2, or 3. The other variables remain unchanged.
