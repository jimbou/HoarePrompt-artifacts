Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the next input, `a` is a string equal to the next input and must be at least 6 characters long if `i` is 5, or `a` is at least 5 characters long if `i` is 3, `s` is a string of length 3 and is equal to the substring of `a` starting at index `i-1` and ending at index `i + 1`, `i` is 5 if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `i` is 3, `ans` is 1 if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1. If `i` was 4, it is now 5, and if `i` was 2, it is now 3. The other variables remain unchanged, but their relationships with `i` have been updated accordingly. The length of `a` is still dependent on the value of `i`, and `s` is still a substring of `a` starting at index `i-1` and ending at index `i + 1`. The value of `ans` is still dependent on the value of `s`.
