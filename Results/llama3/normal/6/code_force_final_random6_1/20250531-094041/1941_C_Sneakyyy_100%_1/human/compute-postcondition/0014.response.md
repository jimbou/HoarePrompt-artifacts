The variables in the loop head are i and a, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `len(a) - 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 2, 3, 4, or 6, and `a` is a string with a length of at least 4. Since `i` is either 2, 3, 4, or 6, and `len(a)` is at least 4, we need to adjust `i` to be less than `len(a) - 2`. This means `i` must be less than or equal to 5, and `len(a)` must be at least 7. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a string with a length of at least 7, `ans` is either 0, 1, or 2, `i` is either 2, 3, 4, or 5, `_` is 0, `s` is a substring of `a` with a length of 3 starting from index 1 or 2, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 1. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 2 and `i` is 6. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie' but `ans` was originally 1, then `ans` is 2 and `i` is 4. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie' but `ans` was originally 0, then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 3. If `s` is not 'map' or 'pie' but `ans` was originally 1, then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 4. If `s` is not 'map' or 'pie' but `ans` was originally 0, then `ans` is 0 and `i` is 2.**
