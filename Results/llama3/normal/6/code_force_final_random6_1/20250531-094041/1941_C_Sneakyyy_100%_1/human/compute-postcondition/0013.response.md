Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `a` is a string with a length of at least 4, `ans` is either 0, 1, or 2, `i` is either 2, 3, 4, or 6, `_` is 0, `s` is a substring of `a` with a length of 3 starting from index 1 or 2, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 1. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 2 and `i` is 6. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie' but `ans` was originally 1, then `ans` is 2 and `i` is 4. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie' but `ans` was originally 0, then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 3. If `s` is not 'map' or 'pie' but `ans` was originally 1, then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 4. If `s` is not 'map' or 'pie' but `ans` was originally 0, then `ans` is 0 and `i` is 2.***
