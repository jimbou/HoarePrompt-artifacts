Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the string contains overlapping substrings "map" or "pie". For example, if the input string is "mapie", the program will count it as two substrings, but it should be counted as one. The program should be modified to handle such cases.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        ans = 0
        i = 0
        while i < len(a) - 2:
            s = a[i:i + 3]
            if s == 'map' or s == 'pie':
                i += 3
                ans += 1
            else:
                i += 1
        print(ans)
```

This corrected version of the program will correctly count the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.
