Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a string with a length of at least 7, `ans` is either 0, 1, or 2, `i` is either 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7, `_` is 0, `s` is a substring of `a` with a length of 3 starting from index `i-1`, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 1. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 2 and `i` is 7. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie' but `ans` was originally 1, then `ans` is 2 and `i` is 5. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie' but `ans` was originally 0, then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 4. If `s` is not 'map' or 'pie' but `ans` was originally 1, then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 5. If `s` is not 'map' or 'pie' but `ans` was originally 0, then `ans` is 0 and `i` is 3.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows: The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` can be 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7. The value of `ans` depends on the original value of `ans` and whether `s` is 'map' or 'pie'. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 2 and `i` is 7. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie' but `ans` was originally 1, then `ans` is 2 and `i` is 5. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie' but `ans` was originally 0, then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 4. If `s` is not 'map' or 'pie' but `ans` was originally 1, then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 5. If `s` is not 'map' or 'pie' but `ans` was originally 0, then `ans` is 0 and `i` is 3. The values of the other variables are not affected.
