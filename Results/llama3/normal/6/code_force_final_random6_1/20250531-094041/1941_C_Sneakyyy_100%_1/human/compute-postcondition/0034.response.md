The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. The initial state specifies that `i` is 1. Therefore, after executing the code, the value of `i` becomes 2.

The values of the other variables are not affected by the code. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `a` is a string equal to the second input and has a length of at least 4, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2, `s` is a substring of `a` starting at index 1 with a length of 3, `ans` is either 0 or 1, and `_` is 1. These conditions remain unchanged after executing the code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `a` is a string equal to the second input and has a length of at least 4, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2, `s` is a substring of `a` starting at index 1 with a length of 3, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 2, and `_` is 1.**
