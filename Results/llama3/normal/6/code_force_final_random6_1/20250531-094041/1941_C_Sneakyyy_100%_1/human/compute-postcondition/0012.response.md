Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a string with a length of at least 4, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 2, `_` is 0, `s` is a substring of `a` with a length of 3 starting from index 2, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 1. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 3. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that `s` is a substring of `a` with a length of 3 starting from index `i` still holds, but now `i` is 2. The condition that if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 3, otherwise `ans` is 0 and `i` is 1, is still valid, but now `i` is 2.
