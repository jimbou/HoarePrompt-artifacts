Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first input, a is a string equal to the second input and has a length of at least 3, ans is 1, i is 3, _ is 1, s is a substring of a starting at index 3 with a length of 3, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2, and the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in a is not being printed.**

The code increments the value of `i` by 3 and the value of `ans` by 1. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `a` also remains the same as it is not modified. The value of `_` is not affected by the code and remains 1. The value of `s` changes as `i` is incremented, and it now refers to a substring of `a` starting at index 3 with a length of 3. The number of test cases in `stdin` remains the same as the code does not consume any input. The number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in `a` is still not being printed as the code does not modify this aspect.
