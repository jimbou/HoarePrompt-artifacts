Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a string with a length of at least 7, `ans` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `i` is either 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, `_` is 0, `s` is a substring of `a` with a length of 3 starting from index `i` or `i-1`, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 1. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 2 and `i` is either 6 or 7. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie' but `ans` was originally 1, then `ans` is 2 and `i` is either 4 or 5. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie' but `ans` was originally 0, then `ans` is 1 and `i` is either 3 or 4. If `s` is not 'map' or 'pie' but `ans` was originally 1, then `ans` is 1 and `i` is either 4 or 5. If `s` is not 'map' or 'pie' but `ans` was originally 0, then `ans` is 0 and `i` is either 2 or 3.**
