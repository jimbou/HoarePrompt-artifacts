Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `a` is a string equal to the second input and has a length greater than 6, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2, `s` is a substring of `a` starting at index `i` with a length of 3. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 2 and `i` is 7. Otherwise, if `s` is not 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is either 1 or 2 and `i` is 5 if `ans` is 2, otherwise `ans` is either 0 or 1 and `i` is 3***
