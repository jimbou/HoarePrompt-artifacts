Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `a` is a string with a length of at least 3, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `i` is either 1 or 3, `_` is 0, `s` is a substring of `a` with a length of 3 starting from index 0, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 1. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 3. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 1.***
