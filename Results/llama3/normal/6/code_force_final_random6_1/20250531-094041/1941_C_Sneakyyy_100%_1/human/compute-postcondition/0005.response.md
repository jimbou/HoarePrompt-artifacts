The code snippet increments the value of `i` by 3 and the value of `ans` by 1. Since `i` was 0, it becomes 3. Since `ans` was 0, it becomes 1. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **n is an integer, a is a string with a length of at least 3, ans is 1, i is 3, _ is 0, s is a substring of a with a length of 3 starting from index 0 and equals either 'map' or 'pie', stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 1.**
