Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the next input, `a` is a string equal to the next input and must be at least 4 characters long if `i` is 2, or `a` is at least 5 characters long if `i` is 4, `s` is a string of length 3 and is equal to the substring of `a` starting at index `i-1` and ending at index `i + 1`, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 4. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1. The conditions for the length of `a` have been updated accordingly. The value of `s` is now equal to the substring of `a` starting at index `i-1` and ending at index `i + 1`. The rest of the variables and conditions remain the same.
