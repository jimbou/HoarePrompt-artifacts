Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a string with a length of at least 3, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1, `_` is 0, `s` is a substring of `a` with a length of 3 starting from index 0, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 1, and `s` is neither 'map' nor 'pie'**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `i` being equal to 1. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and properties. The string `a` still has a length of at least 3, `ans` remains 0, and `_` is still 0. The substring `s` continues to be a substring of `a` with a length of 3, starting from index 0, and is neither 'map' nor 'pie'. The number of test cases in `stdin` is also unchanged, with at least 1 test case minus 1 remaining.
