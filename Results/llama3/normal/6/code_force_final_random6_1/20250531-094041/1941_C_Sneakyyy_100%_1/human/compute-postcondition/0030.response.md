Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `a` is a string equal to the second input and has a length of at least 3, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2, and the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in `a` is not being printed. If the substring `s` of `a` starting at index `i` with a length of 3 is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 3. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 1. In both cases, `_` is 1.***
