The code prints the value of `ans`, which is equal to the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in the string `a`. Since the exact string `a` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the count of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in the string `a`.

Output: **the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in the string a**
