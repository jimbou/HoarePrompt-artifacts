Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `a` is a string equal to the second input and has a length of at least 4, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2, `s` is a substring of `a` starting at index 1 with a length of 3, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 1, and `_` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `s` is now a substring of `a` starting at index 1 with a length of 3, which means it could be either 'map', 'pie', or any other substring of `a` with a length of 3. The values of `n`, `a`, `stdin`, `ans`, `i`, and `_` remain the same as in the initial state.
