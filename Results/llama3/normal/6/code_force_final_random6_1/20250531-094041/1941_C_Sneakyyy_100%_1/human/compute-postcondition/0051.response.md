Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the next input, `a` is a string equal to the next input and must be at least 3 characters long, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1, `s` is a string of length 3 and is equal to the first 3 characters of `a`, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2. Additionally, `s` is not equal to 'map' and not equal to 'pie'.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `s` are still valid.
