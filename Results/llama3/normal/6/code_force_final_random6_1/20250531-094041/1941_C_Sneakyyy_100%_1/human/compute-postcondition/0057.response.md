Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer equal to the next input, `a` is a string equal to the next input and must be at least 4 characters long if `i` is 1 or 2, or `a` is at least 5 characters long if `i` is 3 or 4, `s` is a string of length 3 and is equal to the substring of `a` starting at index `i` and ending at index `i + 2` if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', or `s` is a string of length 3 and is equal to the substring of `a` starting at index `i-1` and ending at index `i + 1` if `s` is not 'map' or 'pie', `i` is 4 if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `i` is 2, `ans` is 1 if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2.***
