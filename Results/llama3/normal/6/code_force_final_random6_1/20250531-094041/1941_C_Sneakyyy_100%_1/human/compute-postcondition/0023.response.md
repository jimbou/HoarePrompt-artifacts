Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first input, a is a string equal to the second input, ans is 0, i is 0, _ is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2, and the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in a is not being printed.**

The code snippet executes as follows: The first line assigns the integer value of the first input to `n`. The second line assigns the string value of the second input to `a`. The third line resets `ans` to 0, effectively discarding the initial count of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in `a`. The fourth line resets `i` to 0, discarding its initial value equal to `len(a) - 2`. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 1. Stdin now contains at least 1 test case minus 2. The number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in `a` is no longer being printed.
