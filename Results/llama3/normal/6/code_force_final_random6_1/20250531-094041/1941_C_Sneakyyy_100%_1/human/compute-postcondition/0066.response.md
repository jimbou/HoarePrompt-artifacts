Output State: **_ is equal to the number of test cases, stdin is empty, and the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in the last test case string which is ans is being printed**

In natural language, this output state means that the loop has finished executing all the iterations, and the loop counter `_` has reached the total number of test cases. The input buffer `stdin` is now empty, as all test cases have been processed. The final output is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in the last test case string, which is stored in the variable `ans`.
