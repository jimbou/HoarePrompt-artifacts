Output State: **`n` is 0, `a` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `counter` is an empty Counter object, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is a list containing one element which is `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is greater than 0, `adv` is greater than 0, `j` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by appending a new element which is the difference between the element at index `i - 1` in list `a` and the value of `j` minus 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
