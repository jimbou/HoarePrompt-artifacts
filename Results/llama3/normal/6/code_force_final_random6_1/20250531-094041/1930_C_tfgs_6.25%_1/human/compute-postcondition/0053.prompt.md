Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is 0, a is a list that must have at least len(a) elements, counter is a Counter object where the count of a[i] is decreased by 1 for all i, cnt is an integer equal to its original value minus the sum of all adv values, ans is a list that contains a[i] as its last element and a[i - 1] - j - 1 as its new last element repeated adv times and a[i] as its new last element for all i, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is len(a) - 1, adv is the minimum of a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, and counter[a[i - 1]] for all i, j is adv - 1 for all i.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(cnt):
    ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is 0, `a` is a list that must have at least len(a) elements, `counter` is a Counter object where the count of `a[i]` is decreased by 1 for all `i`, `cnt` must be greater than 0, `ans` is a list that contains `a[i]` as its last element and `a[i - 1] - j - 1` as its new last element repeated `adv` times and `a[i]` as its new last element for all `i`, and `a[i] - 1` as its new last element, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `adv` is the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `counter[a[i - 1]]` for all `i`, `j` is `adv - 1` for all `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is 0, `a` is a list that must have at least len(a) elements, `counter` is a Counter object where the count of `a[i]` is decreased by 1 for all `i`, `cnt` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `ans` is a list that contains `a[i]` as its last element and `a[i - 1] - j - 1` as its new last element repeated `adv` times and `a[i]` as its new last element for all `i`, and `a[i] - 1` as its new last element, and `ans[-1] - 1` as its new last element, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `adv` is the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `counter[a[i - 1]]` for all `i`, `j` is `adv - 1` for all `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is 0, `a` is a list that must have at least len(a) elements, `counter` is a Counter object where the count of `a[i]` is decreased by 1 for all `i`, `cnt` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list that contains `a[i]` as its last element and `a[i - 1] - j - 1` as its new last element repeated `adv` times and `a[i]` as its new last element for all `i`, and `a[i] - 1` as its new last element, and `ans[-1] - 1` as its new last element twice, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `adv` is the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `counter[a[i - 1]]` for all `i`, `j` is `adv - 1` for all `i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
