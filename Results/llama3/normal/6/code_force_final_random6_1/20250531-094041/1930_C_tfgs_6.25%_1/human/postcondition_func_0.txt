This function reads a test case from standard input, where the first line contains an integer n and the second line contains n integers. It then increments each integer by its 1-based index, removes duplicates, and sorts the list in descending order. The function then constructs a new list by iterating through the sorted list and inserting missing values between each pair of adjacent elements, up to a certain limit. Finally, it prints the constructed list.
