Postcondition: ***`n` is 0, `a` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `counter` is a Counter object, `cnt` is an integer, `ans` is a list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one. If `i` is greater than 0, `counter` is updated by decreasing the count of `a[i - 1]` by `adv`, `cnt` is decreased by `adv`, and `ans` contains `adv` elements which are `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, where `j` is `adv - 1`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
