Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.**

The code reads two lines from stdin for each test case. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. The second line assigns a list of `n` integers from stdin to `a`. After executing the code, stdin contains one less test case, `n` holds the value of the first line of the last read test case, and `a` holds the list of integers from the second line of the last read test case.
