To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Since `n` is already given as an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, we can conclude that `n` is indeed at least 1.

However, we need to adjust the state of `i` to ensure the loop executes. Since the loop starts from 0, we can set `i` to 0.

State: **stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, i is 0**
