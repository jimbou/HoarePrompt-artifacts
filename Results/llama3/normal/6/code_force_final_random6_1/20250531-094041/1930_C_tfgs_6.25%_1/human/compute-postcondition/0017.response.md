Output State: **`n` is 0, `a` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `counter` is an empty Counter object, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is a list containing three elements which are `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is greater than 0, `adv` is greater than 2, `j` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by appending another element `a[i - 1] - j - 1` to the list. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `ans` now contains three elements, each of which is equal to `a[i - 1] - j - 1`. The rest of the variables retain their initial values and properties.
