To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `adv`. The loop will execute if `adv` is at least 1.

State: **`n` is 0, `a` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `counter` is an empty Counter object, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is greater than 0, `adv` is greater than 0, `j` is 0**
