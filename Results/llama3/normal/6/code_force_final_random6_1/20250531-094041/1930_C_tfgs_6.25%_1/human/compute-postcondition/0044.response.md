Postcondition: ***`n` is 0, `a` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `counter` is a Counter object where the count of `a[i]` is decreased by 1, `cnt` is an integer equal to its original value minus `adv`, `ans` is a list that contains `a[i]` as its last element and `a[i - 1] - j - 1` as its new last element repeated `adv` times and `a[i]` as its new last element, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 2, `adv` is the minimum of `a[0] - a[1] - 1`, `cnt`, and `counter[a[0]]`, `j` is `adv - 1. If `i` > 0, then `cnt` is decreased by 2 * `adv`, `ans` is updated with `a[i]` as its last element and `a[i - 1] - j - 1` as its new last element repeated 2 * `adv` times and `a[i]` as its new last element and `a[i - 1] - j - 1` as its new last element and `a[i - 1] - j - 1` as its new last element and `a[i - 1] - j - 1` as its new last element, `adv` is updated to be the minimum of `a[1] - a[2] - 1`, `cnt`, and `counter[a[1]]` and must be greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
