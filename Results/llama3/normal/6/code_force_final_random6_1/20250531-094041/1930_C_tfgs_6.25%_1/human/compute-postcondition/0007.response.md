Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to 0, `a` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive where each element at index `i` is increased by `i + 1`, `i` is `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `n` will be 0, the list `a` will have each of its elements increased by a value equal to its index plus one, the loop counter `i` will be equal to the final value of `n` (which is 0), and the number of test cases in stdin will be reduced by one.
