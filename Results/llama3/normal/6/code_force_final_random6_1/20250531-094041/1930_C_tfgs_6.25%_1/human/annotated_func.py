#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{n} (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] += i + 1
        
    #State: `n` is an integer equal to 0, `a` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive where each element at index `i` is increased by `i + 1`, `i` is `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.

    #State: n is 0, a is a list that must have at least len(a) elements, counter is a Counter object where the count of a[i] is decreased by 1 for all i, cnt is an integer equal to its original value minus the sum of all adv values, ans is a list that contains a[i] as its last element and a[i - 1] - j - 1 as its new last element repeated adv times and a[i] as its new last element for all i, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is len(a) - 1, adv is the minimum of a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, and counter[a[i - 1]] for all i, j is adv - 1 for all i.

    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: a list that contains a[i] as its last element and a[i - 1] - j - 1 as its new last element repeated adv times and a[i] as its new last element for all i, and a[i] - 1 as its new last element, and ans[-1] - 1 as its new last element repeated cnt times

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a test case from standard input, where the first line contains an integer n and the second line contains n integers. It then increments each integer by its 1-based index, removes duplicates, and sorts the list in descending order. The function then constructs a new list by iterating through the sorted list and inserting missing values between each pair of adjacent elements, up to a certain limit. Finally, it prints the constructed list.
