Output: **`n` is 0, `a` is a list that must have at least len(a) elements, `counter` is a Counter object where the count of `a[i]` is decreased by 1 for all `i`, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is a list that contains `a[i]` as its last element and `a[i - 1] - j - 1` as its new last element repeated `adv` times and `a[i]` as its new last element for all `i`, and `a[i] - 1` as its new last element, and `ans[-1] - 1` as its new last element repeated `cnt` times, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `adv` is the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `counter[a[i - 1]]` for all `i`, `j` is `adv - 1` for all `i`, and the elements of the list `ans` are printed**
