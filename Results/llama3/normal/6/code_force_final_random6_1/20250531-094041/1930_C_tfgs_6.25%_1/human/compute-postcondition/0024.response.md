To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `adv`. The loop will execute if `adv` is at least 1.

State: **`n` is 0, `a` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `counter` is a Counter object where the count of `a[i]` is decreased by 1, `cnt` is an integer, `ans` is a list that contains `a[i]` as its last element, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 1, `adv` must be at least 1, `j` is 0**
