Output State: **`n` is 0, `a` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `counter` is an empty Counter object, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is greater than 0, and `adv` is the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `counter[a[i - 1]]`.**

In this output state, the value of `adv` is calculated based on the current values of `a`, `cnt`, and `counter`. The minimum value among `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `counter[a[i - 1]]` is assigned to `adv`. The other variables remain unchanged.
