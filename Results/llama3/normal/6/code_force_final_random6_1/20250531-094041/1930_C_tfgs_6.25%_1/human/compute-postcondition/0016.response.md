To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `adv`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `adv`. If `j` is less than `adv`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `adv` is greater than 1.

For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 2. The value of `adv` remains the same, but for the loop to execute again, it must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is 0, `a` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `counter` is an empty Counter object, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is a list containing two elements which are `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is greater than 0, `adv` is greater than 2, `j` is 2**
