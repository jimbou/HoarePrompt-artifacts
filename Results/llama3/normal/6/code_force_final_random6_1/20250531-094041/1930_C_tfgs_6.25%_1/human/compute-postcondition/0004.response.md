Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive where the first element is increased by 2 and the second element is increased by 3, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of `a[i]` has been increased by `i + 1`, which is 2. Since `i` is 1, the second element of the list `a` has been increased by 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
