Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is 0, a is an empty list, counter is an empty Counter object, cnt is 0, ans is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if i > 0:
        adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, counter[a[i - 1]])
        for j in range(adv):
            ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
        cnt -= adv
        counter[a[i - 1]] -= adv
    ans.append(a[i])
    counter[a[i]] -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is 0, a is a list that must have at least 1 element, counter is a Counter object where the count of a[i] is decreased by 1, cnt is an integer, ans is a list that contains a[i] as its last element, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is 0, a is a list that must have at least 2 elements, counter is a Counter object where the count of a[i] is decreased by 1, cnt is an integer equal to its original value minus adv, ans is a list that contains a[i] as its last element and a[i - 1] - j - 1 as its new last element repeated adv times and a[i] as its new last element, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 1, adv is the minimum of a[0] - a[1] - 1, cnt, and counter[a[0]], j is adv - 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is 0, a is a list that must have at least 3 elements, counter is a Counter object where the count of a[i] is decreased by 1, cnt is an integer equal to its original value minus adv, ans is a list that contains a[i] as its last element and a[i - 1] - j - 1 as its new last element repeated adv times and a[i] as its new last element, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 2, adv is the minimum of a[0] - a[1] - 1, cnt, and counter[a[0]], j is adv - 1. If i > 0, then cnt is decreased by 2 * adv, ans is updated with a[i] as its last element and a[i - 1] - j - 1 as its new last element repeated 2 * adv times and a[i] as its new last element and a[i - 1] - j - 1 as its new last element and a[i - 1] - j - 1 as its new last element and a[i - 1] - j - 1 as its new last element, adv is updated to be the minimum of a[1] - a[2] - 1, cnt, and counter[a[1]] and must be greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
