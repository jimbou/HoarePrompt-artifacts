Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive where the first element is increased by 2, the second element is increased by 3 and the third element is increased by 4, `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of `a[i]` has been updated to `a[2]` (since `i` is 2) which is increased by `i + 1` (which is 3). The other elements of the list `a` remain unchanged. The values of `n` and `i` are also unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
