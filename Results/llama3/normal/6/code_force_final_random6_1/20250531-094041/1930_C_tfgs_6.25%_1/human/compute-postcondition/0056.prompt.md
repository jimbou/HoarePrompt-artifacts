You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{n} (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] += i + 1
        
    #State: `n` is an integer equal to 0, `a` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive where each element at index `i` is increased by `i + 1`, `i` is `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.
    counter = Counter(a)
    a = list(set(a))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    cnt = n - len(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i > 0:
            adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, counter[a[i - 1]])
            for j in range(adv):
                ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
            cnt -= adv
            counter[a[i - 1]] -= adv
        
        ans.append(a[i])
        
        counter[a[i]] -= 1
        
    #State: n is 0, a is a list that must have at least len(a) elements, counter is a Counter object where the count of a[i] is decreased by 1 for all i, cnt is an integer equal to its original value minus the sum of all adv values, ans is a list that contains a[i] as its last element and a[i - 1] - j - 1 as its new last element repeated adv times and a[i] as its new last element for all i, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is len(a) - 1, adv is the minimum of a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, and counter[a[i - 1]] for all i, j is adv - 1 for all i.
    for _ in range(cnt):
        ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
        
    #State: `n` is 0, `a` is a list that must have at least len(a) elements, `counter` is a Counter object where the count of `a[i]` is decreased by 1 for all `i`, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is a list that contains `a[i]` as its last element and `a[i - 1] - j - 1` as its new last element repeated `adv` times and `a[i]` as its new last element for all `i`, and `a[i] - 1` as its new last element, and `ans[-1] - 1` as its new last element repeated `cnt` times, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `adv` is the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `counter[a[i - 1]]` for all `i`, `j` is `adv - 1` for all `i`.
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: a list that contains a[i] as its last element and a[i - 1] - j - 1 as its new last element repeated adv times and a[i] as its new last element for all i, and a[i] - 1 as its new last element, and ans[-1] - 1 as its new last element repeated cnt times

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
