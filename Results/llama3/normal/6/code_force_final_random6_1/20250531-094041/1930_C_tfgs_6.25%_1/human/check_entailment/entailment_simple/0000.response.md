Reasoning: 
The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. The program correctly implements the logic to find the lexicographically largest array `b` that can be constructed from the given array `a` by performing the specified operations.

The program first reads the input, increments each element in the array `a` by its index plus one, and then creates a Counter object to count the occurrences of each element in the array. It then creates a set of unique elements from the array, sorts them in descending order, and initializes an empty list `ans` to store the result.

The program then iterates over the sorted unique elements, and for each element, it calculates the maximum number of times it can be inserted into the result list without violating the condition that the result list should be lexicographically largest. This is done by finding the minimum of the difference between the current element and the previous element minus one, the count of the current element, and the count of the previous element.

The program then inserts the current element into the result list, decrements its count, and repeats the process until all elements have been processed. Finally, it appends the remaining elements to the result list and prints it.

The execution states of the program provided as comments match the expected behavior of the program, and the output of the program matches the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
