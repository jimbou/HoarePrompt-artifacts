Output State: **n is 0, a is a list that must have at least 3 elements, counter is a Counter object where the count of a[i] is decreased by 1, cnt is an integer equal to its original value minus 2 * adv, ans is a list that contains a[i] as its last element and a[i - 1] - j - 1 as its new last element repeated 2 * adv times and a[i] as its new last element and a[i - 1] - j - 1 as its new last element and a[i - 1] - j - 1 as its new last element and a[i - 1] - j - 1 as its new last element, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 2, adv is the minimum of a[1] - a[2] - 1, cnt, and counter[a[1]] and must be greater than or equal to 0, j is adv - 1**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been decreased by `2 * adv`, and the count of `a[i]` in the `counter` object has been decreased by `adv`. The list `ans` has been extended with `a[i]` and `a[i - 1] - j - 1` repeated `2 * adv` times. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the list `a` still has at least 3 elements. The value of `i` is still 2, and the value of `adv` is still the minimum of `a[1] - a[2] - 1`, `cnt`, and `counter[a[1]]`, which is greater than or equal to 0. The value of `j` is still `adv - 1`.
