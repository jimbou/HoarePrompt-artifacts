The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and adv, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `adv`. If `j` is less than `adv`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `adv` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `adv` must be at least 2.
State: **`n` is 0, `a` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `counter` is a Counter object where the count of `a[i]` is decreased by 1, `cnt` is an integer, `ans` is a list that contains `a[i]` as its last element and `a[i - 1] - j - 1` as its new last element, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 1, `adv` must be at least 2, `j` is 1**
