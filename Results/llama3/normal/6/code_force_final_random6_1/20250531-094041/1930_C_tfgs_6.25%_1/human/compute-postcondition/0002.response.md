The value of `a[i]` is increased by `i + 1`. The value of `i` is 0, so `a[0]` is increased by 0 + 1 = 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive where the first element is increased by 1, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.
