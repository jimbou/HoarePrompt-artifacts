Output State: **`n` is 0, `a` is a list that must have at least len(a) elements, `counter` is a Counter object where the count of `a[i]` is decreased by 1 for all `i`, `cnt` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `ans` is a list that contains `a[i]` as its last element and `a[i - 1] - j - 1` as its new last element repeated `adv` times and `a[i]` as its new last element for all `i`, and `a[i] - 1` as its new last element, and `ans[-1] - 1` as its new last element, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `adv` is the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `counter[a[i - 1]]` for all `i`, `j` is `adv - 1` for all `i`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains 0. The list `a` still has at least `len(a)` elements. The Counter object `counter` still has the count of `a[i]` decreased by 1 for all `i`. The value of `cnt` is still greater than 0 but has been decreased by 1. The list `ans` now contains `a[i]` as its last element, `a[i - 1] - j - 1` repeated `adv` times, `a[i]`, and `a[i] - 1` as its new last elements, and also `ans[-1] - 1` as its new last element. The number of test cases in `stdin` is still multiple minus one. The value of `i` is still `len(a) - 1`. The value of `adv` is still the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `counter[a[i - 1]]` for all `i`. The value of `j` is still `adv - 1` for all `i`.
