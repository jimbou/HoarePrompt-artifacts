Output State: **`n` is 0, `a` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `counter` is a Counter object where the count of `a[i]` is decreased by 1, `cnt` is an integer equal to its original value minus `adv`, `ans` is a list that contains `a[i]` as its last element and `a[i - 1] - j - 1` as its new last element repeated `adv` times and `a[i]` as its new last element and `a[i - 1] - j - 1` as its new last element and `a[i - 1] - j - 1` as its new last element, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 2, `adv` is the minimum of `a[1] - a[2] - 1`, `cnt`, and `counter[a[1]]` and must be greater than 0, `j` is 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains 0. The list `a` still has at least 3 elements. The count of `a[i]` in the Counter object `counter` is decreased by 1. The value of `cnt` is reduced by `adv`. The list `ans` has an additional element `a[i - 1] - j - 1` appended to it. The number of test cases in `stdin` remains the same. The value of `i` is still 2. The value of `adv` is still the minimum of `a[1] - a[2] - 1`, `cnt`, and `counter[a[1]]`, and it is greater than 0. The value of `j` is still 1.
