Output State: **`tc` is 0, `N` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[i]]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range `N`, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `tc`, `N`, `a`, and `cnt` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still 1. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one test case. However, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement due to the `break` statement.
