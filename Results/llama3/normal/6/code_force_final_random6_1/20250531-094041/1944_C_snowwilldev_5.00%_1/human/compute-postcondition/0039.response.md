Output State: **`tc` is 1, `N` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with `cnt[a[0]]` increased by 1 and `cnt[a[1]]` increased by 1 and default value 0, `i` is 1, `t` is greater than or equal to 1 or `cnt[i]` is 0 for all `i` in range `N` except for `a[0]` and `a[1]`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt[a[i]]` has been increased by 1, where `i` is 1. This means that the count of the element at index 1 in the list `a` has been incremented by 1 in the dictionary `cnt`. The other variables remain unchanged.
