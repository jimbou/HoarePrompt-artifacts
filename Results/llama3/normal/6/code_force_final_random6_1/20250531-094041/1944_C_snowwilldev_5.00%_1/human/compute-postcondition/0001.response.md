Output State: **tc is 0, N is an integer, a is a list of integers, cnt is a dictionary with default value 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**

The code reads an integer N from stdin and assigns it to the variable N. Then, it reads a list of integers from stdin, splits them into individual integers using the split() function, and assigns the resulting list to the variable a. The defaultdict cnt is initialized with a default value of 0. After executing the code, the value of tc remains unchanged at 0. The variable N now holds an integer value, and the variable a holds a list of integers. The dictionary cnt is initialized but not populated with any values yet. Stdin still contains multiple test cases, but one test case has been consumed by the code.
