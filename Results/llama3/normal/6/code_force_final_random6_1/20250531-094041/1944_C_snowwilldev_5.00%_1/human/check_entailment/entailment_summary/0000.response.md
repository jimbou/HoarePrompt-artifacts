Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the strategy for Alice to maximize the score and Bob to minimize the score in the game.

The program first counts the occurrences of each integer in the list. Then, it iterates through the integers from 0 to N-1. If it finds an integer that appears only once in the list, it means that Alice can pick this integer and Bob cannot pick it, so the MEX of the final list will be at least this integer. If it finds an integer that does not appear in the list, it means that the MEX of the final list will be at least this integer. In both cases, the program prints the integer and moves on to the next test case.

The program's strategy is correct because it ensures that Alice picks the smallest possible integer that will be in the final list, and Bob picks the largest possible integer that will not be in the final list. This maximizes the MEX of the final list, which is the score of the game.

Correctness: **True**
