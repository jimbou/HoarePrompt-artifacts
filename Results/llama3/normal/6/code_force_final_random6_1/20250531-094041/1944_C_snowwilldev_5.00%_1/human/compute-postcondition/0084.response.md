The code prints the current value of `i` which is 0.
Output: **`tc` is 2, `N` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[i]]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range(`N`), `i` is 0, if `cnt[i]` is 1, `t` is 1, otherwise `t` remains 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases. The current value of `t` is either greater than or equal to 2 or the current value of `cnt[i]` is 0, and the value of `i` which is 0 is being printed**
