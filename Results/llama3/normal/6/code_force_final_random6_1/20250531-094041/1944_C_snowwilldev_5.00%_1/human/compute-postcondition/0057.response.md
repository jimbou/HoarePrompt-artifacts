Output: **`tc` is 1, `N` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with `cnt[a[i]]` increased by 1 for all `i` in range `N` and default value 0, `i` is 1, and either the current value of `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or the current value of `cnt[i]` is 0. If `cnt[i]` is 1, then `t` is either 1 or 2. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to `t`, and the value of `i` which is 1 is being printed**
