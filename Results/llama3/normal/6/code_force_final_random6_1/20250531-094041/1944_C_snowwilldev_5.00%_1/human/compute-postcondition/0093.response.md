Postcondition: ***`tc` is 2, `N` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[i]]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range(`N`), `i` is 1, if `cnt[i]` is 1, `t` is 2, otherwise `t` remains 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases. If `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
