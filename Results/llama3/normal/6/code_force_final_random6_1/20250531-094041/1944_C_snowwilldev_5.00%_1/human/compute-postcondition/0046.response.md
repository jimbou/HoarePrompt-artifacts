The value of `t` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `t` was 0, so the new value of `t` is 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus three test cases. The current value of `cnt[i]` is still 1.

Output State: **`tc` is 1, `N` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with `cnt[a[i]]` increased by 1 for all `i` in range `N` and default value 0, `i` is 0, `t` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, and `cnt[i]` is 1.**
