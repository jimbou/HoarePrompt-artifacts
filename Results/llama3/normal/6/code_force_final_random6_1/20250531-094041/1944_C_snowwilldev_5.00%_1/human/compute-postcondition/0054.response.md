Output State: **`tc` is 1, `N` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with `cnt[a[i]]` increased by 1 for all `i` in range `N` and default value 0, `i` is 1, `t` is either 1 or 2, and either `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0, otherwise the program continues.**

The value of `t` is incremented by 1, so it is now either 1 or 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The program still breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0, otherwise it continues.
