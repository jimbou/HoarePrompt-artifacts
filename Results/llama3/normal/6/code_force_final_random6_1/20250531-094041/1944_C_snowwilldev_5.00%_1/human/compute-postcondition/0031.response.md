Output State: **`tc` is 0, `N` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[i]]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range `N`, `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. If `cnt[i]` is 1, `t` is 1. Otherwise, `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `tc`, `N`, `a`, `cnt`, `i`, and `t` remain unchanged. The only change is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
