State: **`tc` is 1, `N` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with `cnt[a[0]]` increased by 1 and `cnt[a[1]]` increased by 1 and default value 0, `i` is 2, `t` is greater than or equal to 1 or `cnt[i]` is 0 for all `i` in range `N` except for `a[0]` and `a[1]`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.**
