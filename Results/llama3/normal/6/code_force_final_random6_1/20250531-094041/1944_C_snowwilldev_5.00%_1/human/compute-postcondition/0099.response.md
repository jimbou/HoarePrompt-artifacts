Output State: **`tc` is 2, `N` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[i]]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range(`N`), `i` is 2, if `cnt[2]` is 1, `t` is 3, otherwise `t` remains 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, and the value of `i` which is 2 has been printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `tc` remains 2, `N` is still an integer greater than 1, `a` is still a list of integers, `cnt` is still a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[i]]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range(`N`), `i` is still 2, if `cnt[2]` is 1, `t` is 3, otherwise `t` remains 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, and the value of `i` which is 2 has been printed. Also, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
