Output State: **`tc` is 0, `N` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[0]]` is increased by 1 and `cnt[a[1]]` is increased by 1 and `cnt[a[2]]` is increased by 1, `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt[a[2]]` is increased by 1 because `cnt[a[i]]` is increased by 1 and `i` is 2. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one test case.
