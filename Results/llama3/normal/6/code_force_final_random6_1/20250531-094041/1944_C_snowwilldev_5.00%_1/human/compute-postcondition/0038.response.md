The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `N`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `N` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `N` must be greater than 1.
State: **`tc` is 1, `N` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with `cnt[a[0]]` increased by 1 and default value 0, `i` is 1, `t` is greater than or equal to 1 or `cnt[i]` is 0 for all `i` in range `N` except for `a[0]`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.**
