Postcondition: ***`tc` is 1, `N` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with `cnt[a[i]]` increased by 1 for all `i` in range `N` and default value 0, `i` is 2. If `t` is 1 and `cnt[i]` is greater than 1, or if `cnt[i]` is 0, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no additional changes are made.***
