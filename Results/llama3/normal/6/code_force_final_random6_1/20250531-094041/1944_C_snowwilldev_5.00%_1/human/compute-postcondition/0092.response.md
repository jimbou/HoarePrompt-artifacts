Output State: **`tc` is 2, `N` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[i]]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range(`N`), `i` is 1, `t` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `tc`, `N`, `a`, `cnt`, `i`, and `t` remain unchanged. The `break` statement only terminates the execution of the innermost loop or if statement, but does not affect the values of the variables. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.
