The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and N, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `N`. If N is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, tc is 0, N is an integer, a is a list of integers, cnt is a dictionary with default value 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `N` is greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **tc is 0, N is an integer that must be greater than 0, a is a list of integers, cnt is a dictionary with default value 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, i is 0**
