Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the strategy for Alice to maximize the score and Bob to minimize the score. The program uses a dictionary to count the occurrences of each number in the array, and then iterates through the numbers from 0 to N-1. If a number has a count of 1, it means that Alice can pick it and Bob cannot pick it, so Alice's score increases by 1. If a number has a count of 0, it means that Bob has already picked it, so Alice's score does not increase. The program prints the smallest number that Alice can pick to maximize her score, which is the MEX of the array.

The program handles all possible cases correctly. For example, if the input is [0, 0, 1, 1], the program correctly outputs 2, because Alice can pick the number 1 and Bob cannot pick it, so Alice's score is 2. If the input is [0, 1, 2, 3], the program correctly outputs 1, because Alice can pick the number 0 and Bob can pick the number 1, so Alice's score is 1. If the input is [1, 1], the program correctly outputs 0, because Alice cannot pick any number and Bob can pick the number 1, so Alice's score is 0.

Overall, the program is correct and handles all possible cases correctly.
