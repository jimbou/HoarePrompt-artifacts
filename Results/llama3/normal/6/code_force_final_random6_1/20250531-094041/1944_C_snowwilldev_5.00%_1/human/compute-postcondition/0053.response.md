The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `N`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `N` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `N` must be greater than 1.
State: **`tc` is 1, `N` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with `cnt[a[i]]` increased by 1 for all `i` in range `N` and default value 0, `i` is 1, the current value of `t` is either 0 or 1, and either the current value of `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or the current value of `cnt[i]` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0, otherwise the program continues.**
