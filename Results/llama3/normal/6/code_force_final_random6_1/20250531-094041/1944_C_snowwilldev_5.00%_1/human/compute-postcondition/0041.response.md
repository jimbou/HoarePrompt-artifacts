Output State: **`tc` is 1, `N` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with `cnt[a[0]]` increased by 1, `cnt[a[1]]` increased by 1, `cnt[a[2]]` increased by 1 and default value 0, `i` is 2, `t` is greater than or equal to 1 or `cnt[i]` is 0 for all `i` in range `N` except for `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt[a[2]]` has been increased by 1, and the other variables remain unchanged. The dictionary `cnt` now has an additional key-value pair for `a[2]`, and the value of `cnt[a[2]]` is 1. The rest of the variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
