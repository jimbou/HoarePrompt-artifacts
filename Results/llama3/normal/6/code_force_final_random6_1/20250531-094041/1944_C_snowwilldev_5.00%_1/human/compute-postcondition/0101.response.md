Output State: **`tc` is 2, `N` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[i]]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range(`N`), `i` is `N`, `t` is the number of unique elements in `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will be the same as the initial state, except for the variables `i` and `t`. The variable `i` will be equal to `N`, which means the loop has iterated over all elements in the list `a`. The variable `t` will be equal to the number of unique elements in the list `a`, because the loop increments `t` whenever it encounters an element that appears only once in the list. The other variables, `tc`, `N`, `a`, `cnt`, and stdin, remain unchanged.
