State: **`tc` is 1, `N` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[i]]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range `N`, `i` is `N`, `t` is greater than or equal to 1 or `cnt[i]` is 0 for all `i` in range `N`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.**
