Output State: **`tc` is 0, `N` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[i]]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range `N`, `i` is `N-1`, `t` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**

In this output state, the code has introduced a new variable `t` and assigned it the value 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one test case.
