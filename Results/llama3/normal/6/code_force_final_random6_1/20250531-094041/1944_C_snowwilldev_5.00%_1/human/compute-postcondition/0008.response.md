Output State: **`tc` is 0, `N` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[i]]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range `N`, `i` is `N-1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `tc` remains unchanged, the value of `N` is still an integer but its value is not changed by the loop, the list `a` remains unchanged, the dictionary `cnt` has been updated to count the occurrences of each integer in the list `a`, the loop variable `i` has reached its final value which is `N-1`, and the standard input remains unchanged.
