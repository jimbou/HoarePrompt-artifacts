Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (1 <= integer <= 2 * 10^4) and then a list of integers (0 <= integer < 2 * 10^5). The sum of the lengths of the lists over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for tc in range(int(input())):
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
    t = 0
    for i in range(N):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
            print(i)
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tc` is 0, `N` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[i]]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range `N`, `i` is `N`, `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0 for all `i` in range `N`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tc` is 1, `N` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with `cnt[a[i]]` increased by 1 for all `i` in range `N` and default value 0, `i` is `N`, `t` is either 0, 1, or 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `tc` is 2, `N` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[i]]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range(`N`), `i` is `N`, `t` is the number of unique elements in `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
