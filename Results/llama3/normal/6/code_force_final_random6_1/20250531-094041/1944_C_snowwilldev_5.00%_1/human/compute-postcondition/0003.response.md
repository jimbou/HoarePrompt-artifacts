Output State: **`tc` is 0, `N` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[0]]` is increased by 1, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt[a[0]]` has been increased by 1, where `a[0]` is the first element of the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one test case.
