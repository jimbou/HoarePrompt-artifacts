Output State: **tc is 2, N is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of integers, cnt is a dictionary with default value 0 and cnt[a[i]] is increased by 1 for all i in range(N), i is N, t is either 0, 1, or 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `tc` remains 2, `N` remains an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` remains a list of integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and the count of each element in `a` is increased by 1, `i` is equal to `N`, `t` is either 0, 1, or 2, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.
