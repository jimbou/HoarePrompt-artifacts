Output State: **tc is 1, N is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of integers, cnt is a dictionary with cnt[a[i]] increased by 1 for all i in range N and default value 0, i is N, t is greater than or equal to 1 or cnt[i] is 0 for all i in range N, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: The loop has finished executing, and the dictionary `cnt` now contains the count of each integer in the list `a`. The variable `i` has reached the end of the list `a`, and the other variables remain unchanged.
