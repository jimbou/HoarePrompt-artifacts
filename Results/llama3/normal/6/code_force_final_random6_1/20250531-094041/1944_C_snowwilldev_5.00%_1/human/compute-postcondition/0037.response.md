Output State: **tc is 1, N is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of integers, cnt is a dictionary with cnt[a[0]] increased by 1 and default value 0, i is 0, t is greater than or equal to 1 or cnt[i] is 0 for all i in range N except for a[0], stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt` dictionary for the key `a[0]` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
