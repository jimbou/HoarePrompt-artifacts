The only variables in the loop head are variables  tc and input. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input. If input is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains multiple test cases does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to input is greater than 0 and tc is now 0. 
State: **stdin contains multiple test cases that must have at least 1 test case, tc is 0**
