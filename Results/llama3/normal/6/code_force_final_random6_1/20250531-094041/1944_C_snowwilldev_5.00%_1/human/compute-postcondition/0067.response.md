Output State: **`tc` is 1, `N` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with `cnt[a[i]]` increased by 1 for all `i` in range `N` and default value 0, `i` is `N`, `t` is either 0, 1, or 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.**

The loop will execute until it reaches the end of the range `N`. After the loop finishes executing, the value of `i` will be equal to `N`, and the value of `t` will be either 0, 1, or 2, depending on the values of `cnt[i]` during the iterations. The other variables, `tc`, `a`, `cnt`, and the contents of `stdin`, remain unchanged.
