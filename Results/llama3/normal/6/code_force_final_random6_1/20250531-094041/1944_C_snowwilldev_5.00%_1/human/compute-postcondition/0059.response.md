Postcondition: ***`tc` is 1, `N` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with `cnt[a[i]]` increased by 1 for all `i` in range `N` and default value 0, `i` is 1. If `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `t` is either 1 or 2 if `cnt[i]` is 1.***
