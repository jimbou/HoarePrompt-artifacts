Postcondition: ***`tc` is 0, `N` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[i]]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range `N`, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. If `cnt[i]` is 1, `t` is 1; otherwise, `t` remains 0.***
