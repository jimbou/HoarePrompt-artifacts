Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of an integer N and a list of integers. It counts the occurrences of each integer in the list and then finds the first integer that appears only once or does not appear at all in the list. If such an integer is found, it prints the integer and moves on to the next test case. The function continues this process until all test cases have been processed, at which point the standard input is empty.**
