Output State: **`tc` is 0, `N` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[0]]` is increased by 1 and `cnt[a[1]]` is increased by 1, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt[a[i]]` has been increased by 1, where `i` is 1. This means that the count of the element at index 1 in the list `a` has been incremented by 1 in the dictionary `cnt`. The other variables remain unchanged.
