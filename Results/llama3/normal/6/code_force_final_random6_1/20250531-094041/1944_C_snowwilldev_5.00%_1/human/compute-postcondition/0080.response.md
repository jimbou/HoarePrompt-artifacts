Output State: **`tc` is 2, `N` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[i]]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range(`N`), `i` is 0, `t` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases. The current value of `cnt[i]` is 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` has been incremented by 1, and it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The test case count `tc` is still 2, the list `a` and its count `cnt` remain the same, and the value of `i` is still 0. The input from stdin is also unchanged, with multiple test cases minus three test cases remaining.
