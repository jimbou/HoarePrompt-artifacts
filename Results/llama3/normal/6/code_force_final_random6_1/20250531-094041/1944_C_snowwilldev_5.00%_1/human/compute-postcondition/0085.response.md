Output State: **`tc` is 2, `N` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[i]]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range(`N`), `i` is 0, if `cnt[i]` is 1, `t` is 1, otherwise `t` remains 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `tc`, `N`, `a`, `cnt`, `i`, and `t` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.
