Postcondition: **`tc` is 0, `N` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[i]]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range `N`, `i` is 0, `t` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. The current value of `cnt[i]` is 1.**
