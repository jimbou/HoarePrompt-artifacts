Postcondition: ***`tc` is 1, `N` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with `cnt[a[i]]` increased by 1 for all `i` in range `N` and default value 0, `i` is 0, `t` is 1 if `cnt[i]` is 1, otherwise `t` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.***
