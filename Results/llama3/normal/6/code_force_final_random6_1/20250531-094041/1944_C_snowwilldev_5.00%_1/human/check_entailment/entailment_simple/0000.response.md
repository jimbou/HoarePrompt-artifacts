Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of an integer `N` and a list of integers `a`.

2. It then counts the occurrences of each integer in the list `a` using a dictionary `cnt`.

3. The program then iterates over the range of possible integers (from 0 to `N-1`) and checks if the count of the current integer is 1. If it is, it increments a counter `t`. If `t` becomes greater than or equal to 2, or if the count of the current integer is 0, it prints the current integer and breaks the loop.

4. The logic behind this is that Alice wants to maximize the MEX of her array `c`, while Bob wants to minimize it. If there are two or more integers that appear only once in the list `a`, Alice can choose one of them and Bob cannot prevent her from getting a MEX of at least 2. If there is only one integer that appears only once, Alice can choose it and Bob cannot prevent her from getting a MEX of at least 1. If there are no integers that appear only once, the MEX of Alice's array `c` will be 0.

5. The program correctly handles the case where the input list `a` is empty, in which case the MEX of Alice's array `c` will be 0.

6. The program also correctly handles the case where the input list `a` contains only one integer, in which case the MEX of Alice's array `c` will be 1 if the integer is 0, and 0 otherwise.

Correctness: **True**
