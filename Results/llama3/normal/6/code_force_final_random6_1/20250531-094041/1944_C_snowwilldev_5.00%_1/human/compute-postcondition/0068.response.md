The only variable in the loop head is variable  tc, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tc`. If `tc` is less than the number of test cases, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `tc` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases. So for the loop to execute again `tc` is 2 and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.
State: **`tc` is 2, `N` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with `cnt[a[i]]` increased by 1 for all `i` in range `N` and default value 0, `i` is `N`, `t` is either 0, 1, or 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.**
