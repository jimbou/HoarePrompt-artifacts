Output: **`tc` is 2, `N` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[i]]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range(`N`), `i` is 2. If `cnt[i]` is 1, `t` is 3, otherwise `t` remains 2. stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, and the value of `i` which is 2 is being printed**
