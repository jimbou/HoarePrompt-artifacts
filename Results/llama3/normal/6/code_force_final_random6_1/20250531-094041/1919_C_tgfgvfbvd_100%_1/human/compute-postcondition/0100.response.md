The code prints the number of elements in list `l` that are greater than `b`. Where `b` is the second smallest element in list `l` if it exists, otherwise `b` is infinity.
Output: **the number of elements in list l that are greater than b (where b is the second smallest element in list l if it exists, otherwise b is infinity)**
