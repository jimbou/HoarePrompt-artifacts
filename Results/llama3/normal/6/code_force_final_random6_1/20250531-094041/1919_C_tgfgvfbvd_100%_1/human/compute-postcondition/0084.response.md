Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `x` is 1, `_` is 2, `a` is either infinity or the value of the element at index `x` of list `l`, `b` is either an integer greater than `a` and less than or equal to infinity or infinity, `c` is either 0 or 1, and stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `l`, `x`, and `_` remain unchanged. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are swapped, meaning that `a` now holds the value of `b` and `b` now holds the value of `a`. The conditions that determine the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are still valid, but the swapping of `a` and `b` means that the values of `a` and `b` are now reversed. The value of `c` remains the same. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.
