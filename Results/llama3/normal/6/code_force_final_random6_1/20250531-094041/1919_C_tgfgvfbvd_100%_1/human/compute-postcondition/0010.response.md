Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `c` is 0, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `_` is 0, `x` is 0, `a` is positive infinity, `b` is the value at index `x` of list `l`, which is greater than `a` and less than or equal to the previous value of `b`.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to be the value at index `x` of list `l`, which is greater than `a` and less than or equal to the previous value of `b`. The other variables remain unchanged.
