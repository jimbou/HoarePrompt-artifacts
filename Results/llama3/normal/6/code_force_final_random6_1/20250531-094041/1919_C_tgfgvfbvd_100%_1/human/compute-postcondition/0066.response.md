The code prints the value of `c`, which is the number of elements in the list `l` that are greater than the second smallest element in `l`. Since `b` is the second smallest element in `l`, the value of `c` is the count of elements in `l` that are greater than `b`.

Output: **the number of elements in the list l that are greater than the second smallest element in l**
