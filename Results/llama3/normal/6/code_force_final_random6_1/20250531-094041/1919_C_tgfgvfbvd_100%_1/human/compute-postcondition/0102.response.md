Output State: **`_` is the number of test cases, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `l` is a list of integers, `x` is `n`, `a` is the smallest element in list `l`, `b` is the second smallest element in list `l` if it exists, otherwise `b` is infinity, and `c` is the number of elements in list `l` that are greater than `b`, and the number of elements in list `l` that are greater than `b` which is `c` is being printed, and stdin contains no more test cases.**

In natural language, this output state means that the loop has executed for all test cases in the input. The loop counter `_` has reached the total number of test cases, and the variables `n`, `l`, `x`, `a`, `b`, and `c` have been updated according to the last test case. The loop has finished executing, and the program is ready to terminate.
