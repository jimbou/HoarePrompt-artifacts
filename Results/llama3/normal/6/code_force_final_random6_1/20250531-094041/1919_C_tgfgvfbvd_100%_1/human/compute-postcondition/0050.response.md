Output State: **`n` is an integer from stdin that must be greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers from stdin, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `_` is 1, `x` is 1. If the first element of `l` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is equal to the current value of `b`, `b` is equal to the current value of `a`, and `c` is 0. Otherwise, `a` is either positive infinity or the first element of `l`, `b` is either positive infinity or the first element of `l`, and `c` is either 0 or 1. If the first element of `l` is less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is equal to the first element of `l`. Otherwise, `a` is equal to the first element of `l` and `c` is 1.**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` have been swapped. If the first element of `l` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` now holds the value of `b` and `b` holds the value of `a`. If the first element of `l` is greater than `a`, then `a` and `b` are either positive infinity or the first element of `l`, and `c` is either 0 or 1. The values of `n`, `l`, `_`, and `x` remain unchanged.
