The code swaps the values of `a` and `b`. Since `a` is infinity and its current value is greater than `b` which is also infinity, after the swap, `b` will be infinity and its current value will be greater than `a` which is also infinity. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `b` is infinity and its current value is greater than `a` which is also infinity, `c` is 0, `x` is 0, `_` is 2, and stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.**
