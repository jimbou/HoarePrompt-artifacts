Output State: **n is an integer from stdin, l is a list of integers from stdin, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, _ is 1, x is n-1, a is positive infinity, b is positive infinity, c is 0**

The code first reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`. Then, it reads a list of integers from stdin and assigns it to `l`. The next three lines initialize `a` and `b` to positive infinity and `c` to 0. The values of `_` and `x` are not affected by the code. The initial values of `a` and `b` as the two smallest values in the list `l` are overwritten by the code. The value of `c` is also reset to 0.
