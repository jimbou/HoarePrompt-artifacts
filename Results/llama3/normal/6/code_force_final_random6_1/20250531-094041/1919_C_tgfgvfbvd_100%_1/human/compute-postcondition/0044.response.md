Output State: **`n` is an integer from stdin that must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers from stdin, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `_` is 1, `x` is 0, `a` is positive infinity, `b` is equal to the first element of `l`, `c` is 0. The first element of `l` is greater than `a`. The current value of `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still an integer greater than 0 from the standard input, and the list `l` still contains integers from the standard input. The standard input still contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. The variable `_` remains 1, and `x` is still 0. The value of `a` is still positive infinity, but the value of `b` has been updated to be equal to the first element of the list `l`. The value of `c` is still 0. The first element of `l` is still greater than `a`, and the current value of `l[x]` is less than or equal to the new value of `b`, which is the first element of `l`.
