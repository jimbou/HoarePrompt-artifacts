Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `x` is 1, `_` is 2, `a` is the value of the element at index 1 of list `l`, `b` is either an integer greater than `a` and less than or equal to infinity or infinity, `c` is either 0 or 1, and stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to be the value of the element at index 1 of list `l`, which is the value of `x`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.
