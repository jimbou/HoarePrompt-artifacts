Output State: **`n` is an integer from stdin that must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers from stdin, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `_` is 1, `x` is 0, `a` is positive infinity and its current value is equal to `b` which is also positive infinity, `c` is 0, `b` is positive infinity and its current value is greater than `a` which is also positive infinity**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `l`, `_`, `x`, and `c` remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `b` are swapped, so `a` now holds the original value of `b` and `b` holds the original value of `a`. Since both `a` and `b` were positive infinity and `a` was greater than `b`, after swapping, `b` is now positive infinity and its current value is greater than `a` which is also positive infinity.
