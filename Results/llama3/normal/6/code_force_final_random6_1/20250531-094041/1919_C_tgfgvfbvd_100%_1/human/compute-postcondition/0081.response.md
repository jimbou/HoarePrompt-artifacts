Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `x` is 0, `_` is 2, and stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. If the element at index `x` of list `l` is less than or equal to `b`, then `a` is infinity, `b` is an integer greater than `a` and less than or equal to infinity, and `c` is 0. Otherwise, `a` is the value of the element at index `x` of list `l`, `b` is infinity, and `c` is 1.***
