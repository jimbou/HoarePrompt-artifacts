Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, l is a list of integers, a is infinity, b is infinity, c is 0, x is undefined, _ is 2, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs
Code of the loop:
for x in range(n):
    if a > b:
        a, b = b, a
    if l[x] <= a:
        a = l[x]
    elif l[x] <= b:
        b = l[x]
    else:
        a = l[x]
        c += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `x` is 0, `_` is 2, and stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. If the element at index `x` of list `l` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is equal to `l[0]`, `b` is infinity, and `c` is 0. Otherwise, if the element at index `x` of list `l` is less than or equal to `b`, then `a` is infinity, `b` is an integer greater than `a` and less than or equal to infinity, and `c` is 0. Otherwise, `a` is the value of the element at index `x` of list `l`, `b` is infinity, and `c` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `x` is 1, `_` is 2, and stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is the value of the element at index 1 of list `l`, `b` is either an integer greater than `a` and less than or equal to infinity or infinity, and `c` is either 0 or 1. If `l[x]` is greater than `a` and less than or equal to `b`, then `a` is either infinity or the value of the element at index `x` of list `l`, `b` is either an integer greater than `a` and less than or equal to infinity or infinity, and `c` is either 0 or 1. If `l[x]` is greater than `b`, then `a` is the value of the element at index `x` of list `l`, `b` is either an integer greater than `a` and less than or equal to infinity or infinity, and `c` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `x` is 2, `_` is 2, and stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is the value of the element at index 2 of list `l`, and `b` is either an integer greater than `a` and less than or equal to infinity or infinity, and `c` is either 0 or 1. If `l[x]` is greater than `a` and less than or equal to `b`, then `a` is either infinity or the value of the element at index `x` of list `l`, `b` is either an integer greater than `a` and less than or equal to infinity or infinity, and `c` is either 0 or 1. If `l[x]` is greater than `b`, then `a` is the value of the element at index `x` of list `l`, `b` is either an integer greater than `a` and less than or equal to infinity or infinity, and `c` is 1. If `a` is greater than `b`, the values of `a` and `b` have been swapped. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is the value of the element at index 2 of list `l`. If `l[x]` is greater than `b`, then `a` is the value of the element at index `x` of list `l`, `b` is either an integer greater than `a` and less than or equal to infinity or infinity, and `c` is 1 plus its original value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
