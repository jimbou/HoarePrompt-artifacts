Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, l is a list of integers, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, _ is 0, x is 1, a is the value at index x of list l, b is positive infinity, c is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to the value at index `x` of list `l`, and `c` has been incremented by 1. The value of `b` remains positive infinity. The roles of `a` and `b` have been swapped if `a` was greater than `b` before the code execution. All other variables remain unchanged.
