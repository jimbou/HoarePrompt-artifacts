Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `_` is 1, `x` is 2, and if `a` is greater than `b`, then `a` and `b` have been swapped, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. If the third element of `l` is less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is the third element of `l`. Otherwise, `a` is the integer at index 2 of `l` and `c` is its original value plus 1.***
