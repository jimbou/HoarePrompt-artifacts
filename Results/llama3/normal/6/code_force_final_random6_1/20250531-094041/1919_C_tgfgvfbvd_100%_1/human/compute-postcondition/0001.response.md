Output State: **n is an integer, l is a list of integers, a is positive infinity, b is positive infinity, c is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, _ is 0**

The code first reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`. Then, it reads a list of integers from stdin and assigns it to `l`. The next two lines initialize `a` and `b` to positive infinity, and `c` to 0. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0. After the code executes, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, since two inputs have been read.
