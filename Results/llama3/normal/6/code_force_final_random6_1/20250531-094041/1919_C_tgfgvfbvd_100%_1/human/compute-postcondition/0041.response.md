Output State: **`n` is an integer from stdin that must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers from stdin, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `_` is 1, `x` is 0, `a` is equal to the current value of `l[x]`, `b` is positive infinity, `c` is 0. The current value of `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a`, and `a` is less than or equal to `b`.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to be equal to the current value of `l[x]`, which is less than or equal to the original value of `a`. The value of `b` remains positive infinity, and the relationship between `a` and `b` is maintained, with `a` being less than or equal to `b`. The values of the other variables, including `n`, `l`, `_`, `x`, and `c`, remain unchanged.
