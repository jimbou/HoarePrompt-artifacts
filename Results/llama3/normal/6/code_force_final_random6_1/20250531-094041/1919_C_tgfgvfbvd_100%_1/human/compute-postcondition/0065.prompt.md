Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer from stdin, l is a list of integers from stdin, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, _ is 1, x is n-1, a is positive infinity, b is positive infinity, c is 0
Code of the loop:
for x in range(n):
    if a > b:
        a, b = b, a
    if l[x] <= a:
        a = l[x]
    elif l[x] <= b:
        b = l[x]
    else:
        a = l[x]
        c += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer from stdin that must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers from stdin, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `_` is 1, `x` is 0. If the first element of `l` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is equal to the current value of `l[x]`, `b` is positive infinity, and `c` is 0. Otherwise, `a` is either positive infinity or the first element of `l`, `b` is either positive infinity or the first element of `l`, and `c` is either 0 or 1. If the first element of `l` is less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is equal to the first element of `l`. Otherwise, `a` is equal to the first element of `l` and `c` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer from stdin that must be greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers from stdin, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `_` is 1, `x` is 1. If the second element of `l` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is the second element of `l`, `b` is either positive infinity or the first element of `l`, and `c` is either 0 or 1. If the second element of `l` is less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is the second element of `l`. Otherwise, `a` is the second element of `l` and `c` is 1. If `a` is greater than `b`, then `a` and `b` are swapped. Otherwise, no changes are made to `a` and `b`. If the second element of `l` is greater than `a`, then if the second element of `l` is less than or equal to `b`, `b` is set to the second element of `l`, `a` is either positive infinity or the first element of `l`, and `c` is either 0 or 1. Otherwise, `a` is either the first element of `l` or the current value of `b`, `b` is either the first element of `l` or the current value of `a`, and `c` is either 1 or 2. In both cases, if `a` is greater than `b`, then `a` and `b` are swapped. Otherwise, no changes are made to `a` and `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer from stdin that must be greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers from stdin, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `_` is 1, `x` is 2, and if `a` is greater than `b`, then `a` and `b` have been swapped. If the third element of `l` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is the third element of `l`. Otherwise, if the third element of `l` is less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is the third element of `l`. Otherwise, `a` is the integer at index 2 of `l` and `c` is its original value plus 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
