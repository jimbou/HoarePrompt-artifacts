Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer from stdin that must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers from stdin, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `_` is 1, `x` is 0, `a` is positive infinity, `b` is positive infinity, `c` is 0. If `a` > `b`, then `a` and `b` are equal and both are positive infinity, and `b` is greater than `a`. The current value of `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a`.***
