Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `_` is 0, `x` is 1, `a` is positive infinity, `b` is the value at index `x` of list `l`, `c` is 0. If the value at index `x` of list `l` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is updated to the value at index `x` of list `l`. If the value at index `x` of list `l` is greater than `a`, then `a` is updated to the value at index `x` of list `l` and `c` is set to 1. If `a` is greater than `b`, then the roles of `a` and `b` are swapped in the above conditions.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to the value at index `x` of list `l`. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for updating `a` and `c` are still valid, but the specific values of `a` and `c` depend on the value at index `x` of list `l`.
