The only variable in the loop head is variable `x` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x` and `n`. If `x` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `x` must be increased by 1 so `x` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer from stdin that must be greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers from stdin, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `_` is 1, `x` is 1. If the first element of `l` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is equal to the current value of `l[x]`, `b` is positive infinity, and `c` is 0. Otherwise, `a` is either positive infinity or the first element of `l`, `b` is either positive infinity or the first element of `l`, and `c` is either 0 or 1. If the first element of `l` is less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is equal to the first element of `l`. Otherwise, `a` is equal to the first element of `l` and `c` is 1.**
