The only variable in the loop head is variable  x and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x` and `n`. If `x` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. At the for the x is increased by 1 so x is 1 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `_` is 0, `x` is 1. Either `a` is positive infinity and is less than `b` which is also positive infinity, or `a` is positive infinity and is not less than `b` which is also positive infinity. If the value at index `x` of list `l` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is updated to the value at index `x` of list `l` and `b` remains unchanged. If the value at index `x` of list `l` is less than or equal to `b` but greater than `a`, then `b` is updated to the value at index `x` of list `l` and `c` remains 0. If the value at index `x` of list `l` is greater than `b`, then `a` is updated to the value at index `x` of list `l` and `c` is set to 1.**
