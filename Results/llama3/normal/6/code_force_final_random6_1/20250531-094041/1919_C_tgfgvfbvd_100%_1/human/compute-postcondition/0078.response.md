Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is infinity, `b` is an integer greater than `a` and less than or equal to infinity, `c` is 0, `x` is 0, `_` is 2, and stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. The element at index `x` of list `l` is greater than `a` and less than or equal to `b`.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to be the element at index `x` of list `l`, which is greater than `a` and less than or equal to infinity. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Note that the value of `b` is now a specific integer, but its exact value is not known, only its relationship to `a` and infinity is known.
