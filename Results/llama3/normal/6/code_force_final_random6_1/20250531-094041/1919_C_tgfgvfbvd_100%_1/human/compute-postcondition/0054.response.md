Output State: **n is an integer from stdin that must be greater than 1, l is a list of integers from stdin, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, _ is 1, x is 1, a is either the first element of l or the current value of b, b is either the first element of l or the current value of a, and c is either 1 or 2.**

In this output state, the value of `a` and `b` depends on the first element of `l`. If the first element of `l` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is equal to the current value of `b`, and `b` is equal to the current value of `a`. Otherwise, `a` is either positive infinity or the first element of `l`, and `b` is either positive infinity or the first element of `l`. The value of `c` is either 1 or 2, depending on whether the first element of `l` is less than or equal to `b`. If `a` is greater than `b`, then `a` and `b` are swapped. Otherwise, no changes are made to `a` and `b`.
