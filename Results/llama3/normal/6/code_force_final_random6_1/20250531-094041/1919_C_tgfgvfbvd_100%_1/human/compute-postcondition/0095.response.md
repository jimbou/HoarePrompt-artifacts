Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `x` is 2, `_` is 2, `b` is the value of the element at index 2 of list `l`, and stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is the value of the element at index 2 of list `l`, `c` is either 0 or 1. If `l[x]` is greater than `a` and less than or equal to `b`, then `a` is either infinity or the value of the element at index `x` of list `l`, `c` is either 0 or 1. If `l[x]` is greater than `b`, then `a` is the value of the element at index `x` of list `l`, `c` is 1. If `a` is greater than `b`, the values of `a` and `b` have been swapped.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to be the value of the element at index 2 of list `l`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The conditions for `a` and `c` are still dependent on the relationship between `l[x]` and `a` or `b`.
