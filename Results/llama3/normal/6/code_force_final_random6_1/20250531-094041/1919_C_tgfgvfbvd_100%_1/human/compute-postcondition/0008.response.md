Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `c` is 0, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `_` is 0, `x` is 0. Either `a` is positive infinity and is less than `b` which is also positive infinity, or `a` is positive infinity and is not less than `b` which is also positive infinity. The value at index `x` of list `l` is greater than `a`.***
