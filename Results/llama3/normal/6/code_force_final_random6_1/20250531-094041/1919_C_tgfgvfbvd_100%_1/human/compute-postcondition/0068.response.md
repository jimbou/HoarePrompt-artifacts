To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.

The only object in the loop head that can be adjusted is `_`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `_`. If `_` is less than the number of test cases (which is `int(input())`), the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, and `int(input())` is greater than or equal to 0. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be increased by 1.

State: **`n` is an integer from stdin that must be greater than or equal to 0, `l` is a list of integers from stdin, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `_` is 2, `x` is `n-1`, `a` is the smallest element in `l`, `b` is the second smallest element in `l`, and `c` is the number of elements in `l` that are greater than the second smallest element**
