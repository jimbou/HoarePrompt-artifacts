Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `x` is 2, `_` is 2, `a` is the value of the element at index 2 of list `l`, and stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. If the value of the element at index 2 of list `l` is less than or equal to the value of the element at index 2 of list `l`, then `b` is either an integer greater than the value of the element at index 2 of list `l` and less than or equal to infinity or infinity, and `c` is either 0 or 1. If the value of the element at index 2 of list `l` is greater than the value of the element at index 2 of list `l` and less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is either an integer greater than the value of the element at index 2 of list `l` and less than or equal to infinity or infinity, and `c` is either 0 or 1. If the value of the element at index 2 of list `l` is greater than `b`, then `b` is either an integer greater than the value of the element at index 2 of list `l` and less than or equal to infinity or infinity, and `c` is 1. If the value of the element at index 2 of list `l` is greater than `b`, the values of the value of the element at index 2 of list `l` and `b` have been swapped.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `a` is now the value of the element at index 2 of list `l`. The values of `n`, `l`, `x`, and `_` remain unchanged. The values of `b` and `c` are still dependent on the value of `a` and the original values of `b` and `c`. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.
