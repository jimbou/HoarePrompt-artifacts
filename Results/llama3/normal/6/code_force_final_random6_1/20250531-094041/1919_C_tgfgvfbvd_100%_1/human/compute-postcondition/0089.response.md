Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `x` is 1, `_` is 2, and stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`, then `a` is either infinity or the value of the element at index `x` of list `l`, `b` is either an integer greater than `a` and less than or equal to infinity or infinity, and `c` is either 0 or 1. If `l[x]` is greater than `b`, then `a` is the value of the element at index `x` of list `l`, `b` is either an integer greater than `a` and less than or equal to infinity or infinity, and `c` is 1.***
