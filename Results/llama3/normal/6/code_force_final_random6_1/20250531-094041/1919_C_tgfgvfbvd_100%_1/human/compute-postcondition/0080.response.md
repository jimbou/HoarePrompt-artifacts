Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, l is a list of integers, a is the value of the element at index x of list l, b is infinity, c is 1, x is 0, _ is 2, and stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the value of the element at index `x` of list `l` to `a`. Since the element at index `x` of list `l` is greater than `a` and also larger than `b`, and `a` and `b` are infinity, the value of `a` becomes the value of the element at index `x` of list `l`. The second line increments `c` by 1, making `c` equal to 1. No other variables are affected.
