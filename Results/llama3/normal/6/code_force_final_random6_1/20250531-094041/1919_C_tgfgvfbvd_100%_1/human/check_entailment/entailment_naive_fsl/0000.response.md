Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it follows the problem description and handles all potential cases. The program splits the array into two subsequences `s` and `t` and calculates the penalty `p(s) + p(t)`.

The program uses two variables `a` and `b` to keep track of the smallest elements in `s` and `t` respectively. It iterates through the array and updates `a` and `b` accordingly. If an element is smaller than or equal to `a`, it updates `a`. If an element is smaller than or equal to `b`, it updates `b`. If an element is greater than both `a` and `b`, it updates `a` and increments the penalty counter `c`.

The program handles the case where the array has only one element, in which case the penalty is 0. It also handles the case where the array has multiple elements, and the penalty is calculated correctly.

The program also handles the case where the array is already sorted, in which case the penalty is 0. It also handles the case where the array is reverse sorted, in which case the penalty is 0.

The program does not have any obvious edge cases that it does not handle correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.

Note: The program uses a greedy approach to solve the problem, which is optimal in this case because the penalty is calculated based on the number of indices where the element is greater than the previous element. The program always chooses the smallest element to add to `s` or `t`, which minimizes the penalty.
