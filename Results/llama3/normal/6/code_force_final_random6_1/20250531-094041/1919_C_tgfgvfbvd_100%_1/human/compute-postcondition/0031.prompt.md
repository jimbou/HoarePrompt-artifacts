Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, l is a list of integers, a is positive infinity, b is positive infinity, c is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, _ is 0
Code of the loop:
for x in range(n):
    if a > b:
        a, b = b, a
    if l[x] <= a:
        a = l[x]
    elif l[x] <= b:
        b = l[x]
    else:
        a = l[x]
        c += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `_` is 0, `x` is 0. Either `a` is positive infinity and is less than `b` which is also positive infinity, or `a` is positive infinity and is not less than `b` which is also positive infinity. If the value at index `x` of list `l` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is updated to the value at index `x` of list `l` and `b` remains unchanged. If the value at index `x` of list `l` is less than or equal to `b` but greater than `a`, then `b` is updated to the value at index `x` of list `l` and `c` remains 0. If the value at index `x` of list `l` is greater than `b`, then `a` is updated to the value at index `x` of list `l` and `c` is set to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `_` is 0, `x` is 1. `a` and `b` are updated to be the two smallest values in the list `l` so far, with `a` being the smaller one and `b` being the larger one. If the value at index `x` of list `l` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is updated to the value at index `x` of list `l` and `b` remains unchanged, and `c` is 0. If the value at index `x` of list `l` is greater than `b`, then `a` is updated to the value at index `x` of list `l` and `c` is set to 1. If `a` is greater than `b`, then the roles of `a` and `b` are swapped in the above conditions. In all cases, `c` is set to 1 if the value at index `x` of list `l` is greater than `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `_` is 0, `x` is 2. `a` and `b` are the two smallest values in the list `l` so far, with `a` being the smaller one and `b` being the larger one. If the value at index `x` of list `l` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is updated to the value at index `x` of list `l` and `b` remains unchanged, and `c` is 0. If the value at index `x` of list `l` is greater than `b`, then `a` is updated to the value at index `x` of list `l` and `c` is set to 1. If `a` is greater than `b`, then the roles of `a` and `b` are swapped in the above conditions. In all cases, `c` is set to 1 if the value at index `x` of list `l` is greater than `b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
