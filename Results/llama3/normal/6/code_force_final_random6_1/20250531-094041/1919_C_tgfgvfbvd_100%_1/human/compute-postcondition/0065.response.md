Output State: **`n` is an integer from stdin that must be greater than or equal to 0, `l` is a list of integers from stdin, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `_` is 1, `x` is `n-1`, `a` is the smallest element in `l`, `b` is the second smallest element in `l`, and `c` is the number of elements in `l` that are greater than the second smallest element.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state is as follows:

*   The value of `n` remains unchanged, which is an integer from the standard input.
*   The value of `l` remains unchanged, which is a list of integers from the standard input.
*   The value of `_` remains unchanged, which is 1.
*   The value of `x` is `n-1`, which is the last index of the list `l`.
*   The value of `a` is the smallest element in the list `l`.
*   The value of `b` is the second smallest element in the list `l`.
*   The value of `c` is the number of elements in the list `l` that are greater than the second smallest element.
