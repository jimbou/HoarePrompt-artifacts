Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines of input. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a, b = float('inf'), float('inf')
    c = 0
    for x in range(n):
        if a > b:
            a, b = b, a
        if l[x] <= a:
            a = l[x]
        elif l[x] <= b:
            b = l[x]
        else:
            a = l[x]
            c += 1
    print(c)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `_` is 0, `x` is `n-1`, `a` and `b` are the two smallest values in the list `l`, with `a` being the smaller one and `b` being the larger one, and `c` is the number of values in `l` that are greater than `b`, and the number of values in `l` that are greater than `b` which is `c` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer from stdin that must be greater than or equal to 0, `l` is a list of integers from stdin, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `_` is 1, `x` is `n-1`, `a` is the smallest element in `l`, `b` is the second smallest element in `l`, and `c` is the number of elements in `l` that are greater than the second smallest element, and the number of elements in `l` that are greater than the second smallest element which is `c` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `l` is a list of integers, `x` is `n`, `_` is 2, and stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. `a` is the smallest element in list `l`, `b` is the second smallest element in list `l` if it exists, otherwise `b` is infinity, and `c` is the number of elements in list `l` that are greater than `b`, and the number of elements in list `l` that are greater than `b` which is `c` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
