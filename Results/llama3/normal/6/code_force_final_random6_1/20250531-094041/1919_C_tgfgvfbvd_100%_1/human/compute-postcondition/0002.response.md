According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer, but it does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `x` is now 0.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is positive infinity, `b` is positive infinity, `c` is 0, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `_` is 0, `x` is 0**
