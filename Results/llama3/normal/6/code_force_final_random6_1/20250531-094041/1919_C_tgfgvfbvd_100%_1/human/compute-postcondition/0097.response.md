Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `x` is 2, `_` is 2, and stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is the value of the element at index 2 of list `l`. If `l[x]` is greater than `b`, then `a` is the value of the element at index `x` of list `l`, `b` is either an integer greater than `a` and less than or equal to infinity or infinity, and `c` is 1 plus its original value. If `a` is greater than `b`, the values of `a` and `b` have been swapped.**
