Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `_` is 0, `x` is 1, `a` is the value at index `x` of list `l`, `b` is positive infinity, `c` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to the value at index `x` of list `l`, which is the second element of the list (since `x` is 1). The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Note that `b` is still positive infinity, and `c` is still 0, as the conditions for updating these variables were not met.
