Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `_` is 0, `x` is 2, `a` is the value at index `x` of list `l`, `b` is the smaller of the two smallest values in the list `l` so far, `c` is 1 if the value at index `x` of list `l` is greater than `b`, otherwise `c` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to the value at index `x` of list `l`, which is now the new value of `a`. The value of `b` remains the same as before, which is the smaller of the two smallest values in the list `l` so far. The value of `c` is set to 1 if the value at index `x` of list `l` is greater than `b`, otherwise it remains 0. The other variables `n`, `l`, `stdin`, `_`, and `x` remain unchanged.
