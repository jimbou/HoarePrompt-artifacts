Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is positive infinity and is less than `b` which is also positive infinity, `c` is 0, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `_` is 0, `x` is 0**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `l`, `c`, `stdin`, `_`, and `x` remain unchanged. However, the values of `a` and `b` have been swapped. Initially, `a` was greater than `b`, but after the execution of the code, `a` is now less than `b`, both still being positive infinity.
