Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `_` is 0, `x` is 1. Either `b` is positive infinity and is less than `a` which is also positive infinity, or `b` is positive infinity and is not less than `a` which is also positive infinity. If the value at index `x` of list `l` is less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is updated to the value at index `x` of list `l` and `a` remains unchanged. If the value at index `x` of list `l` is less than or equal to `a` but greater than `b`, then `a` is updated to the value at index `x` of list `l` and `c` remains 0. If the value at index `x` of list `l` is greater than `a`, then `b` is updated to the value at index `x` of list `l` and `c` is set to 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `l`, `stdin`, `_`, and `x` remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `b` are swapped. The conditions for updating `a` and `b` based on the value at index `x` of list `l` are also swapped.
