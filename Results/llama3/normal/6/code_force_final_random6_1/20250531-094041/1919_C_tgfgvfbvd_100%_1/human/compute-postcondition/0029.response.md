Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `_` is 0, `x` is 2. If the value at index `x` of list `l` is less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is updated to the value at index `x` of list `l`, `a` is the smaller of the two smallest values in the list `l` so far, and `c` is 1 if the value at index `x` of list `l` is greater than the original value of `b`, otherwise `c` is 0. Otherwise, `a` is updated to the value at index `x` of list `l`, `b` is the original value of `a`, and `c` is 1.***
