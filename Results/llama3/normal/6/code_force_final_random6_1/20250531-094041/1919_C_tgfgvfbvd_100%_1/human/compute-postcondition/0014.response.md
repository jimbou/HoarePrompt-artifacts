Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `_` is 0, `x` is 0. Either `a` is positive infinity and is less than `b` which is also positive infinity, or `a` is positive infinity and is not less than `b` which is also positive infinity. If the value at index `x` of list `l` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is updated to the value at index `x` of list `l` and `b` remains unchanged. If the value at index `x` of list `l` is less than or equal to `b` but greater than `a`, then `b` is updated to the value at index `x` of list `l` and `c` remains 0. If the value at index `x` of list `l` is greater than `b`, then `a` is updated to the value at index `x` of list `l` and `c` is set to 1.***
