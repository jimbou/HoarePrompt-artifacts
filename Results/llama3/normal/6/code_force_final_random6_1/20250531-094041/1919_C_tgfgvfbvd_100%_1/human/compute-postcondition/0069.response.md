Output State: **n is an integer, l is a list of integers, a is infinity, b is infinity, c is 0, x is undefined, _ is 2, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs**

The code block consists of four lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. The second line assigns a list of integers from stdin to `l`. The third line assigns infinity to both `a` and `b`. The fourth line assigns 0 to `c`. 

After the code block executes, `n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `a` and `b` are infinity, and `c` is 0. The variable `x` is no longer defined because it was defined in terms of `n`, which has been reassigned. The variable `_` remains 2, and stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.
