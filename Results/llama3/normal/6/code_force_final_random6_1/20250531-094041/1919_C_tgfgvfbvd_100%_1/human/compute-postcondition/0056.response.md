Postcondition: **`n` is an integer from stdin that must be greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers from stdin, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `_` is 1, `x` is 1. If the second element of `l` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is the second element of `l`, `b` is either positive infinity or the first element of `l`, and `c` is either 0 or 1. If the second element of `l` is less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is the second element of `l`. Otherwise, `a` is the second element of `l` and `c` is 1. If `a` is greater than `b`, then `a` and `b` are swapped. Otherwise, no changes are made to `a` and `b`. If the second element of `l` is greater than `a`, then if the second element of `l` is less than or equal to `b`, `b` is set to the second element of `l`, `a` is either positive infinity or the first element of `l`, and `c` is either 0 or 1. Otherwise, `a` is either the first element of `l` or the current value of `b`, `b` is either the first element of `l` or the current value of `a`, and `c` is either 1 or 2. In both cases, if `a` is greater than `b`, then `a` and `b` are swapped. Otherwise, no changes are made to `a` and `b`.**
