Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `x` is 2, `_` is 2, and stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is the value of the element at index 2 of list `l`, `b` is either an integer greater than `a` and less than or equal to infinity or infinity, and `c` is either 0 or 1. If `l[x]` is greater than `a` and less than or equal to `b`, then `a` is either infinity or the value of the element at index `x` of list `l`, `b` is either an integer greater than `a` and less than or equal to infinity or infinity, and `c` is either 0 or 1. If `l[x]` is greater than `b`, then `a` is the value of the element at index `x` of list `l`, `b` is either an integer greater than `a` and less than or equal to infinity or infinity, and `c` is 1. The values of `a` and `b` have been swapped.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the values of `a` and `b` have been swapped. The values of `n`, `l`, `x`, and `_` remain unchanged. The conditions for `a`, `b`, and `c` based on the value of `l[x]` also remain the same, but the values of `a` and `b` have been interchanged.
