The only variable in the loop head is variable `x` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x` and `n`. If `x` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `x` is increased by 1 so `x` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer from stdin that must be greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers from stdin, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `_` is 1, `x` is 2**
