Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is equal to `l[0]`, `b` is infinity, `c` is 0, `x` is 0, `_` is 2, and stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to be equal to the value of `l[0]`, which is the first element of the list `l`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.
