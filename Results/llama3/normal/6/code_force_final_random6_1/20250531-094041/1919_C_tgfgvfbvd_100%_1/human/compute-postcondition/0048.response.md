Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer from stdin that must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers from stdin, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `_` is 1, `x` is 0. If the first element of `l` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is equal to the current value of `l[x]`, `b` is positive infinity, and `c` is 0. Otherwise, `a` is either positive infinity or the first element of `l`, `b` is either positive infinity or the first element of `l`, and `c` is either 0 or 1. If the first element of `l` is less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is equal to the first element of `l`. Otherwise, `a` is equal to the first element of `l` and `c` is 1.***
