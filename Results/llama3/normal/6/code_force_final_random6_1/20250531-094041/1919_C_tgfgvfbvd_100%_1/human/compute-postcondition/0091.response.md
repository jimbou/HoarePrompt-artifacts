To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `x` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `x` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `x` must be incremented by 1, so `x` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `x` has increased, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `x` is 2, `_` is 2, and stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is the value of the element at index 2 of list `l`, `b` is either an integer greater than `a` and less than or equal to infinity or infinity, and `c` is either 0 or 1. If `l[x]` is greater than `a` and less than or equal to `b`, then `a` is either infinity or the value of the element at index `x` of list `l`, `b` is either an integer greater than `a` and less than or equal to infinity or infinity, and `c` is either 0 or 1. If `l[x]` is greater than `b`, then `a` is the value of the element at index `x` of list `l`, `b` is either an integer greater than `a` and less than or equal to infinity or infinity, and `c` is 1.**
