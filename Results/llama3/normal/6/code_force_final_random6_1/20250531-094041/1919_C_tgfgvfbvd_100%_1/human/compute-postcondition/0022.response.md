Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `_` is 0, `x` is 1. `a` and `b` are updated to be the two smallest values in the list `l` so far, with `a` being the smaller one and `b` being the larger one. If the value at index `x` of list `l` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is updated to the value at index `x` of list `l` and `b` remains unchanged, and `c` is 0. If the value at index `x` of list `l` is greater than `b`, then `a` is updated to the value at index `x` of list `l` and `c` is set to 1. If `a` is greater than `b`, then the roles of `a` and `b` are swapped in the above conditions. In all cases, `c` is set to 1 if the value at index `x` of list `l` is greater than `b`.***
