Based on the precondition, the print statement will output the value of `c`, which is the number of values in the list `l` that are greater than `b`. Since `b` is the second smallest value in the list `l`, `c` represents the count of values in `l` that are greater than the second smallest value.

Output: **the number of values in list l that are greater than b (where b is the second smallest value in list l)**
