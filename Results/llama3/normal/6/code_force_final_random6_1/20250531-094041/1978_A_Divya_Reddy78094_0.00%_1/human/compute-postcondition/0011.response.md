The code prints the sum of the first two elements of the list `nums`. Since `nums` is a list of `n` integers in descending order, the first two elements are the largest and second-largest integers in the list. The value of `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, but the exact value is not provided. However, since `nums` is in descending order, we can infer that the first element (`nums[0]`) is the largest integer in the list, and the second element (`nums[1]`) is the second-largest integer in the list.

Output: **The sum of the largest and second-largest integers in the list nums**
