According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, which ensures that the loop will execute. However, to make the state more specific, we can adjust `t` to be at least 1.

State: **`t` is at least 1, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9)**
