The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t. If t is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, t must be greater than 1. So, t is 2.
State: **t is 2, n is an integer between 2 and 100, nums is a list of n integers in descending order, stdin contains t-1 test cases, and the sum of the first two elements of the list nums is being printed, which are the largest and the second largest numbers in the list**
