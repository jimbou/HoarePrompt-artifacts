Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first integer from the input, which is between 1 and 500 inclusive. The stdin still contains the remaining input, which consists of `t` test cases. Each test case contains an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 100) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).
