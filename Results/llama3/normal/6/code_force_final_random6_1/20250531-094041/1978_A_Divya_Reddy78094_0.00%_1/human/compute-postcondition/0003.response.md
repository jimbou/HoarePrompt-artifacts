The code prints the sum of the first two elements of the list `nums`. Since `nums` is a list of `n` integers in descending order, the first two elements are the largest and second-largest numbers in the list, respectively. Therefore, the output will be the sum of these two largest numbers in the list `nums`.

Output: **The sum of the first two elements of the list nums (which are the two largest numbers in the list)**
