The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `n` becomes an integer between 2 and 100. The second line assigns a list of integers from stdin to `nums`. Since stdin contains t-1 test cases, and t is 1, stdin is now empty. The third line sorts `nums` in descending order. Since `nums` is already in descending order, `nums` remains the same.

Output State: **t is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 100, nums is a list of n integers in descending order, stdin is empty**
