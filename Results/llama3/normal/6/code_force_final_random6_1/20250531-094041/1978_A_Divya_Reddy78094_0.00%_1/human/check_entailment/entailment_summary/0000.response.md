Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem by sorting the list of integers in descending order and then printing the sum of the two largest numbers. This approach is correct because it ensures that the two largest numbers are always selected, which is the goal of the problem.

The program reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the number of books and the list of integers representing the number of pages in each book. It then sorts the list in descending order using the `sort` function with the `reverse=True` argument. Finally, it prints the sum of the two largest numbers, which are `nums[0]` and `nums[1]`.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, reading the input, sorting the integers, and printing the sum of the two largest numbers.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution summary, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
