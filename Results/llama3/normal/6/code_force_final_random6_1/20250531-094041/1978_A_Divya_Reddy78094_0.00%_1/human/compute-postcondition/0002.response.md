Output State: **t is at least 1, n is an integer between 2 and 100, nums is a list of n integers in descending order, stdin contains t-1 test cases**

The code reads an integer n from the input, which is between 2 and 100. It then reads n integers from the input, stores them in a list called nums, and sorts the list in descending order. The value of t is not affected by the code, but since one test case has been processed, there are now t-1 test cases remaining in the input.
