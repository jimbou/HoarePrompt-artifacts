Output State: **t is 2, n is an integer between 2 and 100, nums is a list of n integers in descending order, stdin contains t-2 test cases, and the sum of the first two elements of the list nums is being printed, which are the largest and the second largest numbers in the list**

The code snippet reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`, which is already an integer between 2 and 100. The second line reads a list of `n` integers from stdin, sorts them in descending order, and assigns the sorted list to `nums`. Since `nums` was already a list of `n` integers in descending order, the sorting operation does not change the order of the elements. The sum of the first two elements of the list `nums` is being printed, which are the largest and the second largest numbers in the list. The value of `t` remains unchanged at 2. Stdin now contains `t-2` test cases.
