Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted from a given string to make it beautiful. A string is considered beautiful if it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map".

The provided program uses the `count` method to count the occurrences of the substrings "map", "pie", and "mapie" in the input string. It then prints the sum of the counts of "map" and "pie" minus the count of "mapie".

The reasoning behind this approach is as follows:

*   Counting the occurrences of "map" and "pie" gives the total number of substrings that need to be removed to make the string beautiful.
*   However, counting "mapie" separately is necessary because it contains both "map" and "pie". If we simply add the counts of "map" and "pie", we would be double-counting the "mapie" substrings.
*   By subtracting the count of "mapie" from the sum of the counts of "map" and "pie", we ensure that each "mapie" substring is only counted once.

This approach correctly calculates the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

Correctness: **True**
