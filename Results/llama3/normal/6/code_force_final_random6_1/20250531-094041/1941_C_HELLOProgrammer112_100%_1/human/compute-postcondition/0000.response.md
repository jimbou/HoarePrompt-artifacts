The only objects in the loop head are variables `_` and `int(input())`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input. If the input is at least 1 the loop executes. Before the loop starts, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. So for the loop to be executed  the input must be at least 1 and the variable `_` is 0.
State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases, `_` is 0, int(input()) must be at least 1**
