This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a string s of length n. For each test case, it counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map', 'pie', and 'mapie' in the string s, and prints the sum of the counts of 'map' and 'pie' minus the count of 'mapie'. The function processes all test cases and prints the results for each case.
