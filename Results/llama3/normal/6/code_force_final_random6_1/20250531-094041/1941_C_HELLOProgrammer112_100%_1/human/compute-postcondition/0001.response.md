Output State: **a is an integer at least 1, s is a string, x is the number of occurrences of 'map' in s, y is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in s, z is the number of occurrences of 'mapie' in s, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `a`. Since `a` must be at least 1, `a` becomes an integer at least 1. The second line assigns the string value of the input to `s`. The third line assigns the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s` to `x`. The fourth line assigns the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s` to `y`. The fifth line assigns the number of occurrences of 'mapie' in `s` to `z`. The value of `_` remains unchanged, and stdin now contains `t-1` test cases.
