Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. The program correctly reads the input, counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map', 'pie', and 'mapie' in the string s, and prints the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful.

The program uses the count() method of the string class to count the occurrences of the substrings 'map', 'pie', and 'mapie' in the string s. The count() method returns the number of occurrences of the substring in the string.

The program then prints the sum of the counts of 'map' and 'pie' minus the count of 'mapie'. This is because the count of 'mapie' is included in both the counts of 'map' and 'pie', so subtracting it once ensures that each occurrence of 'mapie' is only counted once.

The program processes all test cases and prints the results for each case.

Correctness: **True**
