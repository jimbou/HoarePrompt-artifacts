Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to count the occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in the input string, and subtracts the count of 'mapie' to avoid double-counting. This is because 'mapie' contains both 'map' and 'pie', and subtracting its count ensures that each occurrence of 'mapie' is only counted once.

The program also correctly handles the case where the input string does not contain any occurrences of 'map' or 'pie', in which case it prints 0.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, processing each test case and printing the correct result.

Correctness: **True**
