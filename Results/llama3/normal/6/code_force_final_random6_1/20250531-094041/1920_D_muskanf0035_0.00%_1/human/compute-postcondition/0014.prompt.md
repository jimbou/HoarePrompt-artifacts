You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, operations is a list of n lists, each containing two integers, and queries is a list of integers.
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, q = map(int, input().split())
        
        operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
        
        queries = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        result = func_1(n, operations, queries)
        
        print(*result)
        
    #State: n is an integer equal to the first input, q is an integer equal to the second input, operations is a list of n lists, each containing two integers from stdin, queries is a list of integers from stdin, t is equal to 0, _ is equal to t, result is the return value of func_1(n, operations, queries), stdin is empty, and the result of func_1(n, operations, queries) is being printed, and the result of func_1(n, operations, queries) which is stored in the variable result is being printed, and the elements of the result are being printed.

```

Return Postconditions: n is an integer equal to the first input, q is an integer equal to the second input, operations is a list of n lists, each containing two integers from stdin, queries is a list of integers from stdin, t is equal to 0, _ is equal to t, result is the return value of func_1(n, operations, queries), stdin is empty, and the result of func_1(n, operations, queries) is being printed, and the result of func_1(n, operations, queries) which is stored in the variable result is being printed, and the elements of the result are being printed.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
