Output State: `n` is a non-negative integer, `operations` is an empty list of tuples, `queries` is an empty list of non-negative integers, `array` is a list containing non-negative integers, `result` is a list containing the value of `array` at index `(k - 1) % len(array)` for each query `k` in the original list of queries.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have an empty list of queries, and the result list will contain the values from the array that correspond to each query in the original list of queries. The other variables remain unchanged.
