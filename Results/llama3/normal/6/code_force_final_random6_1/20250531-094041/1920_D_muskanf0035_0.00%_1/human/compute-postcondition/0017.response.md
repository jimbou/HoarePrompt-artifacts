Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `operations` is an empty list of tuples, `queries` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 query, `array` is a list containing non-negative integers, `result` is a list containing the value of `array` at index `(k - 1) % len(array)`, `k` is the first query in the list**

In this output state, the value of `result` has been updated to include the value of `array` at the index calculated by `(k - 1) % len(array)`. This means that the first query `k` is used to index into the `array` list, and the value at that index is appended to the `result` list. The other variables remain unchanged.
