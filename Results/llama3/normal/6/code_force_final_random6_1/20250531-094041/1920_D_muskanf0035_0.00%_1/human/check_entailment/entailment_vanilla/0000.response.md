Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program defines two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` takes in the number of operations `n`, a list of operations, and a list of queries. It initializes an empty array and a result list. It then iterates through the operations, appending values to the array for operation type 1 and extending the array with its own elements for operation type 2. After processing all operations, it iterates through the queries, calculating the index of the corresponding element in the array using the modulo operator to handle indices greater than the array length. The result is appended to the result list.

2. `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input, then iterates through each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of operations `n` and the number of queries `q`, followed by the operations and queries. It calls `func_1` with the read inputs and prints the result.

3. The program correctly handles the two types of operations as described in the problem statement. For operation type 1, it appends the given value to the array. For operation type 2, it extends the array with its own elements, effectively duplicating the array.

4. The program correctly handles queries by calculating the index of the corresponding element in the array using the modulo operator. This ensures that indices greater than the array length are handled correctly by wrapping around to the beginning of the array.

5. The program reads input correctly, following the format specified in the problem statement.

6. The program prints the result correctly, using the `*` operator to unpack the result list into separate arguments to the `print` function.

Correctness: **True**
