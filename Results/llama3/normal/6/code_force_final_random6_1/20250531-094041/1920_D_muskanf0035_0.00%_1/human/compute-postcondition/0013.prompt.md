Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a list of `n` lists, each containing two integers, `queries` is a list of integers, `t` is an integer
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
    queries = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = func_1(n, operations, queries)
    print(*result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is a positive integer equal to the first input, q is a positive integer equal to the second input, operations is a list of n lists, each containing two integers from stdin, queries is a list of integers from stdin, t is greater than 0, _ is 0, result is the return value of func_1(n, operations, queries), stdin is empty, and the result of func_1(n, operations, queries) is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer equal to the first input, q is an integer equal to the second input, operations is a list of n lists, each containing two integers from stdin, queries is a list of integers from stdin, t is greater than 1, _ is 1, result is the return value of func_1(n, operations, queries), stdin is empty, and the result of func_1(n, operations, queries) is being printed, and the result of func_1(n, operations, queries) which is stored in the variable result is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer equal to the first input, q is an integer equal to the second input, operations is a list of n lists, each containing two integers from stdin, queries is a list of integers from stdin, t is greater than 0, _ is 0, result is the return value of func_1(n, operations, queries), stdin is empty, and the result of func_1(n, operations, queries) is being printed, and the result of func_1(n, operations, queries) which is stored in the variable result is being printed, and the elements of the result are being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
