Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Jayden has an array a which is initially empty. There are n operations of two
types he must perform in the given order.

  1. Jayden appends an integer x (1 \leq x \leq n ) to the end of array a . 
  2. Jayden appends x copies of array a to the end of array a . In other words, array a becomes [a,\underbrace{a,\ldots,a}_{x}] . It is guaranteed that he has done at least one operation of the first type before this. 

Jayden has q queries. For each query, you must tell him the k -th element of
array a . The elements of the array are numbered from 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \leq n, q
\leq 10^5 ) — the number of operations and the number of queries.

The following n lines describe the operations. Each line contains two integers
b and x (b \in \\{1, 2\\} ), where b denotes the type of operation. If b=1 ,
then x (1 \leq x \leq n ) is the integer Jayden appends to the end of the
array. If b=2 , then x (1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ) is the number of copies Jayden
appends to the end of the array.

The next line of each test case contains q integers k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_q (1
\leq k_i \leq \min(10^{18}, c) ), which denote the queries, where c is the
size of the array after finishing all n operations.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output q integers — answers to Jayden's queries.

Note

In the first test case:

  * After the first operation a = [1] ;
  * After the second operation a = [1, 2] ;
  * After the third operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2] ;
  * After the fourth operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3] ;
  * After the fifth operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3] .

In the fourth test case, after all operations a = [1, 2] .

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer, operations is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers, the first integer is either 1 or 2, and the second integer is a non-negative integer, and queries is a list of non-negative integers.
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])
        
    #State: `n` is a non-negative integer, `operations` is an empty list of tuples, `queries` is a list of non-negative integers, `array` is a list containing non-negative integers, `result` is an empty list.
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
        
    #State: Output State: `n` is a non-negative integer, `operations` is an empty list of tuples, `queries` is an empty list of non-negative integers, `array` is a list containing non-negative integers, `result` is a list containing the value of `array` at index `(k - 1) % len(array)` for each query `k` in the original list of queries.
    #
    #In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have an empty list of queries, and the result list will contain the values from the array that correspond to each query in the original list of queries. The other variables remain unchanged.
    return result
    #The program returns a list of non-negative integers, where each integer is the value of `array` at index `(k - 1) % len(array)` for each query `k` in the original list of queries. The list `queries` is empty, and the other variables `n`, `operations`, and `array` remain unchanged.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes in a non-negative integer `n`, a list of operations where each operation is a tuple containing an operation type (1 or 2) and a non-negative integer value, and a list of non-negative integer queries. It processes the operations to construct an array by either appending values or duplicating the existing array. Then, it uses the constructed array to answer the queries by returning the values at indices corresponding to each query modulo the length of the array. The function returns a list of non-negative integers, where each integer is the value of the array at the index corresponding to each query. The original lists of operations and queries are emptied, while the other variables remain unchanged.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, operations is a list of n lists, each containing two integers, and queries is a list of integers.
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, q = map(int, input().split())
        
        operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
        
        queries = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        result = func_1(n, operations, queries)
        
        print(*result)
        
    #State: n is an integer equal to the first input, q is an integer equal to the second input, operations is a list of n lists, each containing two integers from stdin, queries is a list of integers from stdin, t is equal to 0, _ is equal to t, result is the return value of func_1(n, operations, queries), stdin is empty, and the result of func_1(n, operations, queries) is being printed, and the result of func_1(n, operations, queries) which is stored in the variable result is being printed, and the elements of the result are being printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes three parameters: a positive integer n, a list of n lists (operations) where each sublist contains two integers, and a list of integers (queries). It processes the operations and queries, and returns a list of results. The function's purpose is to perform a series of operations based on the input queries and return the outcome. The final state of the program is that the result of the function is printed, with each element of the result printed separately.
