Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:

The program does not correctly handle the case when the query index `k` is greater than the length of the array `array`. In the `func_1` function, the line `result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])` uses the modulo operator to ensure that the index is within the bounds of the array. However, this approach is incorrect because it assumes that the array is always non-empty, which is not guaranteed.

For example, if the input is `n = 1`, `operations = [(1, 1)]`, and `queries = [2]`, the program will raise an `IndexError` because the array is empty and `len(array)` is 0.

To fix this issue, the program should add a check to ensure that the array is not empty before attempting to access its elements.
