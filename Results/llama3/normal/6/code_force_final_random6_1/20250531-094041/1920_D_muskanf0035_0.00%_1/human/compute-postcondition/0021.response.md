Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `operations` is an empty list of tuples, `queries` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 3 queries, `array` is a list containing non-negative integers, `result` is a list containing the value of `array` at index `(k - 1) % len(array)` three times where `k` is the third query in the list, `k` is the third query in the list**

The code appends the value of `array` at index `(k - 1) % len(array)` to the `result` list. Since `result` already contains the value of `array` at index `(k - 1) % len(array)` twice, it now contains this value three times. The values of the other variables are not affected.
