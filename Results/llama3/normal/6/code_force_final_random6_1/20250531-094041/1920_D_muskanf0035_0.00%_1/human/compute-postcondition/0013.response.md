Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first input, q is an integer equal to the second input, operations is a list of n lists, each containing two integers from stdin, queries is a list of integers from stdin, t is equal to 0, _ is equal to t, result is the return value of func_1(n, operations, queries), stdin is empty, and the result of func_1(n, operations, queries) is being printed, and the result of func_1(n, operations, queries) which is stored in the variable result is being printed, and the elements of the result are being printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: The loop has finished executing, and the values of `n`, `q`, `operations`, and `queries` are the same as the last input values. The variable `t` is now 0, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `_` is also 0, as it is reset to 0 after each iteration. The result of the last call to `func_1` is stored in the variable `result` and is being printed. The elements of the result are also being printed. The standard input (`stdin`) is empty, as all input values have been read and processed.
