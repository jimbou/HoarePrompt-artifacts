Based on the precondition, the `print(*result)` statement will print the return value of the function `func_1(n, operations, queries)`. The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n`, `operations`, and `queries`. 

The value of `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `operations` is a list of `n` lists, each containing two integers from stdin, and `queries` is a list of integers from stdin. 

Since the exact inputs are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `result`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the return value of `func_1`, which is stored in the `result` variable.

Output: **the return value of func_1(n, operations, queries) (where n is the first input, operations is a list of n lists containing two integers from stdin, and queries is a list of integers from stdin)**
