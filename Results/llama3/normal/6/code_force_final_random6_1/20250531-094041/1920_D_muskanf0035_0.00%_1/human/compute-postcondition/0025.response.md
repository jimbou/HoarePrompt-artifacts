Functionality: **This function takes in a non-negative integer `n`, a list of operations where each operation is a tuple containing an operation type (1 or 2) and a non-negative integer value, and a list of non-negative integer queries. It processes the operations to construct an array by either appending values or duplicating the existing array. Then, it uses the constructed array to answer the queries by returning the values at indices corresponding to each query modulo the length of the array. The function returns a list of non-negative integers, where each integer is the value of the array at the index corresponding to each query. The original lists of operations and queries are emptied, while the other variables remain unchanged.**
