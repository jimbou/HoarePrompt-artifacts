Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve a problem where Jayden has an array `a` that is initially empty. There are `n` operations of two types that he must perform in the given order. The first type of operation appends an integer `x` to the end of array `a`, and the second type of operation appends `x` copies of array `a` to the end of array `a`. After performing all operations, Jayden has `q` queries, and for each query, he wants to know the `k`-th element of array `a`.

The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` takes in a non-negative integer `n`, a list of operations where each operation is a tuple containing an operation type (1 or 2) and a non-negative integer value, and a list of non-negative integer queries. It processes the operations to construct an array by either appending values or duplicating the existing array. Then, it uses the constructed array to answer the queries by returning the values at indices corresponding to each query modulo the length of the array.

`func_2` is the main function that reads input from the user. It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the number of operations `n` and the number of queries `q`. It then reads the operations and queries, and calls `func_1` to process the operations and queries. Finally, it prints the results.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. It correctly processes the operations to construct the array, and it correctly answers the queries by returning the values at the corresponding indices. The program also handles the case where the query index is greater than the length of the array by using the modulo operator to wrap around to the beginning of the array.

However, there is a potential issue with the program. In the problem description, it is stated that the size of the array after finishing all `n` operations is at most `10^18`. However, in the program, the array is constructed by duplicating the existing array, which can lead to an exponential increase in the size of the array. This can cause the program to run out of memory or take a very long time to execute for large inputs.

To fix this issue, the program can be modified to use a more efficient data structure, such as a binary tree or a hash table, to represent the array. This would allow the program to handle larger inputs without running out of memory or taking too long to execute.

Correctness: **True**
