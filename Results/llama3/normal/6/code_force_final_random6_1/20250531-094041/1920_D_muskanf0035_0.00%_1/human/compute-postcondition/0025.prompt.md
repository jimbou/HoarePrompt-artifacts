You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer, operations is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers, the first integer is either 1 or 2, and the second integer is a non-negative integer, and queries is a list of non-negative integers.
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])
        
    #State: `n` is a non-negative integer, `operations` is an empty list of tuples, `queries` is a list of non-negative integers, `array` is a list containing non-negative integers, `result` is an empty list.
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
        
    #State: Output State: `n` is a non-negative integer, `operations` is an empty list of tuples, `queries` is an empty list of non-negative integers, `array` is a list containing non-negative integers, `result` is a list containing the value of `array` at index `(k - 1) % len(array)` for each query `k` in the original list of queries.
    #
    #In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have an empty list of queries, and the result list will contain the values from the array that correspond to each query in the original list of queries. The other variables remain unchanged.
    return result
    #The program returns a list of non-negative integers, where each integer is the value of `array` at index `(k - 1) % len(array)` for each query `k` in the original list of queries. The list `queries` is empty, and the other variables `n`, `operations`, and `array` remain unchanged.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list of non-negative integers, where each integer is the value of `array` at index `(k - 1) % len(array)` for each query `k` in the original list of queries. The list `queries` is empty, and the other variables `n`, `operations`, and `array` remain unchanged.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Use Natural language easily understandable by humans and strictly reply with the format: Functionality: ** your response here **
