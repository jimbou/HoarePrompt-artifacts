Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `operations` is an empty list of tuples, `queries` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 queries, `array` is a list containing non-negative integers, `result` is a list containing the value of `array` at index `(k - 1) % len(array)` and the value of `array` at index `(k - 1) % len(array)` where `k` is the second query in the list**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables remain the same as in the initial state, except for the `result` list, which now contains an additional element. This additional element is the value of `array` at the index calculated by `(k - 1) % len(array)`, where `k` is the second query in the `queries` list.
