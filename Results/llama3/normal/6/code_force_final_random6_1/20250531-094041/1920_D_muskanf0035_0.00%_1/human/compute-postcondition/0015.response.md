Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `operations` is an empty list of tuples, `queries` is a list of non-negative integers, `array` is a list containing non-negative integers, `result` is an empty list.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list of operations will be empty, the list of queries will remain unchanged, the array will contain a list of non-negative integers, and the result list will still be empty.
