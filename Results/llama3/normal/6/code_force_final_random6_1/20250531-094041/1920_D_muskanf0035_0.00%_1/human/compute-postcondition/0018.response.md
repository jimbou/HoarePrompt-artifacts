The only variable in the loop head is variable  k, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `queries`. If `queries` has at least 2 queries the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `queries` has at least 1 query, `k` is the first query in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 queries and the `k` is the second query in the list.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `operations` is an empty list of tuples, `queries` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 queries, `array` is a list containing non-negative integers, `result` is a list containing the value of `array` at index `(k - 1) % len(array)`, `k` is the second query in the list**
