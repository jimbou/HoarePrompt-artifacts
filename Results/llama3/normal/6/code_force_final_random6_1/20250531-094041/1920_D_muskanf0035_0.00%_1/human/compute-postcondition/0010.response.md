Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first input, q is an integer equal to the second input, operations is a list of n lists, each containing two integers from stdin, queries is a list of integers from stdin, t is greater than 0, _ is 0, result is the return value of func_1(n, operations, queries), stdin is empty, and the result of func_1(n, operations, queries) is being printed, and the result of func_1(n, operations, queries) which is stored in the variable result is being printed**

The code block consists of four lines. The first line assigns the values of the first and second inputs to `n` and `q`, respectively. The second line creates a list of `n` lists, each containing two integers from stdin, and assigns it to `operations`. The third line creates a list of integers from stdin and assigns it to `queries`. The fourth line calls the function `func_1` with `n`, `operations`, and `queries` as arguments and assigns the return value to `result`. 

Since `func_1` is not defined in the given code snippet, its effect on the program state is unknown. However, it is mentioned that the result of `func_1(n, operations, queries)` is being printed, which means that the function call has some output. 

The initial state mentions that `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, and `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`. These values are not modified by the given code snippet. 

Therefore, the final output state includes the values of `n`, `q`, `operations`, `queries`, `t`, `_`, and `result`, as well as the fact that the result of `func_1(n, operations, queries)` is being printed.
