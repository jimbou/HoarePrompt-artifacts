To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. In this case, the only variable in the loop head is `k`, which takes on the value of each query in the `queries` list.

At the end of the previous iteration, `k` was the second query in the list. For the loop to execute again, `k` should be the next query in the list. Since `queries` must have at least 2 queries, we can assume that there is a third query in the list.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `operations` is an empty list of tuples, `queries` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 3 queries, `array` is a list containing non-negative integers, `result` is a list containing the value of `array` at index `(k - 1) % len(array)` and the value of `array` at index `(k - 1) % len(array)` where `k` is the third query in the list, `k` is the third query in the list**
