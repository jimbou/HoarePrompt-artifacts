Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The function `func_1` only checks if the value of `b` is even or not, and returns 'yes' for even numbers and 'no' for odd numbers. However, this is not the correct logic to solve the problem.

The problem requires checking if it is possible to cut the rectangle into two rectangles with integer sides and then form another rectangle from the two resulting rectangles. The function `func_1` does not take into account the value of `a` and does not perform any checks related to cutting the rectangle or forming another rectangle.

For example, the input `3 2` should return 'yes' because the rectangle can be cut into two 3x1 rectangles and then formed into a 1x6 rectangle. However, the function `func_1` will return 'no' because `b` is not even.

Correctness: **False**
