Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by checking if the width of the rectangle (b) is even. If it is, the program prints 'yes', indicating that another rectangle can be formed. If it's not, the program prints 'no'.

However, this approach is incorrect. The problem statement does not guarantee that the width of the rectangle will always be even when another rectangle can be formed. In fact, the example test cases show that this is not the case.

For instance, in the test case where a = 3 and b = 2, the program will print 'no' because b is not even. However, as explained in the problem statement, it is possible to form another rectangle (1 x 6) from the two 3 x 1 rectangles.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
