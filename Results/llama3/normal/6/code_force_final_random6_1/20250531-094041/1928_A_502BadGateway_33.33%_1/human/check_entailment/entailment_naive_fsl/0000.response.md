Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem. The function `func_1` only checks if `b` is even, but this is not a sufficient condition to determine if another rectangle can be formed. For example, if `a` is 3 and `b` is 2, the program will output "no", but it is actually possible to form another rectangle by cutting the 3x2 rectangle into two 3x1 rectangles and then forming a 1x6 rectangle.

A correct solution would need to consider the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, and check if the GCD is greater than 1. If the GCD is greater than 1, then it is possible to form another rectangle by cutting the original rectangle into two rectangles with sides of length `a/GCD` and `b/GCD`, and then forming a rectangle with sides of length `a/GCD` and `b`.
