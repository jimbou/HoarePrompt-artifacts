Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The function `func_1(a, b)` only checks if `b` is even, and returns 'yes' if it is, and 'no' otherwise. However, this does not accurately solve the problem.

The problem requires determining if it is possible to cut a rectangle of size `a x b` into two rectangles with integer sides, and then form another rectangle from these two rectangles. The function `func_1(a, b)` does not take into account the value of `a`, and only checks if `b` is even. This is not sufficient to determine if another rectangle can be formed.

For example, if `a = 3` and `b = 2`, the function will return 'yes', but it is not possible to form another rectangle from the two rectangles obtained by cutting the original rectangle.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
