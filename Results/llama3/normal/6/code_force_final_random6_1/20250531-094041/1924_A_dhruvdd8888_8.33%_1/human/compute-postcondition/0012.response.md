Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a non-empty string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases. If the second character `i` of `s` is in the set `us` and the length of `win` is equal to `k`, then `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the first two characters of `s`, `ps` is 2, and `i` is the second character of `s`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
