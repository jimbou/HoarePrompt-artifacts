Output State: **`stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a non-empty string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `win` is a set containing the second character of `s`, `ans` is a list containing the first character of `s`, `ps` is 1, and `i` is the second character of `s`.**

In this output state, the only change is that the set `win` now contains the second character of the string `s`, which was previously empty. All other variables remain unchanged.
