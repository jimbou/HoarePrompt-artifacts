You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^5) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n (1 <= n <= 26), k (1 <= k <= 26), and m (1 <= m <= 1000). The second line contains a string s of length m consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.
    n, k, m = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    us = set(chr(i + 97) for i in range(k))
    win = set()
    ans = []
    ps = 0
    for i in s:
        if i in us:
            win.add(i)
            if len(win) == k:
                ans.append(i)
                ps += 1
                win.clear()
        
    #State: `n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is an empty string, `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing all the characters in `s` that are in `us` and are the `kth` character in a subsequence of `s` consisting of characters in `us`, `ps` is the number of times a subsequence of `s` consisting of characters in `us` has length `k`, `i` is the last character of `s` and is also in the set `us`.
    if (ps >= n) :
        return print('YES')
        #The program prints 'YES'
    #State: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string, `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `win` is a set, `ans` is a list containing all the characters in `s` that are in `us` and are the `kth` character in a subsequence of `s` consisting of characters in `us`, `ps` is the number of times a subsequence of `s` consisting of characters in `us` has length `k`, `i` is the last character of `s` and is also in the set `us`. The number of times a subsequence of `s` consisting of characters in `us` has length `k` is less than `n`.
    print('NO')
    #This is printed: NO
    for i in us:
        if i not in win:
            print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
        
    #State: `n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string, `us` is an empty set, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `win` is a set, `ans` is a list containing all the characters in `s` that are in `us` and are the `kth` character in a subsequence of `s` consisting of characters in `us`, `ps` is the number of times a subsequence of `s` consisting of characters in `us` has length `k`, `i` is the last character in `us`. If `i` is not in `win`, then a string is printed consisting of all characters in `s` that are in `us` and are the `kth` character in a subsequence of `s` consisting of characters in `us` (which is `ans`), followed by the last character in `us` (which is `i`), and then 'a' repeated `n - len(ans) - 1` times.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program prints 'YES'

Case_2: `n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string, `us` is an empty set, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `win` is a set, `ans` is a list containing all the characters in `s` that are in `us` and are the `kth` character in a subsequence of `s` consisting of characters in `us`, `ps` is the number of times a subsequence of `s` consisting of characters in `us` has length `k`, `i` is the last character in `us`. If `i` is not in `win`, then a string is printed consisting of all characters in `s` that are in `us` and are the `kth` character in a subsequence of `s` consisting of characters in `us` (which is `ans`), followed by the last character in `us` (which is `i`), and then 'a' repeated `n - len(ans) - 1` times.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
