To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head `for i in s:` and the given state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head indicates that `i` takes on the value of each character in the string `s` in sequence. Given that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the first character of `s` and is also in the set `us`, we can infer that for the loop to execute again, `i` should move to the next character in `s`.

Since `s` is a non-empty string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, and we've already processed the first character, the next character that `i` should take on is the second character of `s`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is the value of `i`, which should become the second character of `s`.

State: **`stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a non-empty string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the first character of `s`, `ps` is 1, and `i` is the second character of `s`.**
