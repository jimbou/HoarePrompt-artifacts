Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string, `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `win` is a set, `ans` is a list containing all the characters in `s` that are in `us` and are the `kth` character in a subsequence of `s` consisting of characters in `us`, `ps` is the number of times a subsequence of `s` consisting of characters in `us` has length `k`, `i` is the last character of `s` and is also in the set `us`. The number of times a subsequence of `s` consisting of characters in `us` has length `k` is less than `n`, and 'NO' is printed
Code of the loop:
for i in us:
    if i not in win:
        print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string, `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets that must have at least 1 character, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `win` is a set, `ans` is a list containing all the characters in `s` that are in `us` and are the `kth` character in a subsequence of `s` consisting of characters in `us`, `ps` is the number of times a subsequence of `s` consisting of characters in `us` has length `k`, `i` is the first character in `us`. If `i` is not in `win`, then a string is printed consisting of all characters in `s` that are in `us` and are the `kth` character in a subsequence of `s` consisting of characters in `us` (which is `ans`), followed by the first character in `us` (which is `i`), followed by 'a' repeated `n - len(ans) - 1` times.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string, `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets that must have at least 2 characters, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `win` is a set, `ans` is a list containing all the characters in `s` that are in `us` and are the `kth` character in a subsequence of `s` consisting of characters in `us`, `ps` is the number of times a subsequence of `s` consisting of characters in `us` has length `k`, `i` is the second character in `us`. If `i` is not in `win`, a string consisting of all the characters in `s` that are in `us` and are the `kth` character in a subsequence of `s` consisting of characters in `us`, followed by the second character in `us`, and then 'a' repeated `n - len(ans) - 1` times is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string, `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets that must have at least 3 characters, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `win` is a set, `ans` is a list containing all the characters in `s` that are in `us` and are the `kth` character in a subsequence of `s` consisting of characters in `us`, `ps` is the number of times a subsequence of `s` consisting of characters in `us` has length `k`, `i` is the third character in `us`. If `i` is not in `win`, then a string is printed consisting of all characters in `s` that are in `us` and are the `kth` character in a subsequence of `s` consisting of characters in `us` (which is `ans`), followed by the third character in `us` (which is `i`), and then 'a' repeated `n - len(ans) - 1` times.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
