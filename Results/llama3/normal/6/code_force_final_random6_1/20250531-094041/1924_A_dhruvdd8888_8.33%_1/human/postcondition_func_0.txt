This function determines if a given string contains a specified number of subsequences of a certain length, consisting of a specific set of characters. It takes as input three integers (n, k, m) and a string s, where n is the desired number of subsequences, k is the length of each subsequence, and m is the length of the string. The function then checks if the string contains at least n subsequences of length k, consisting of the first k lowercase English alphabets. If it does, the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' and generates all possible strings that can be formed by appending characters to the input string to make it contain at least n subsequences of length k.
