Output State: **`stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a non-empty string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the first character of `s`, `ps` is 1, and `i` is the first character of `s` and is also in the set `us`.**

The code executes three lines. The first line appends the value of `i` to the list `ans`, making `ans` contain the first character of `s`. The second line increments the value of `ps` by 1, making `ps` equal to 1. The third line clears the set `win`, making it an empty set. No other variables are affected.
