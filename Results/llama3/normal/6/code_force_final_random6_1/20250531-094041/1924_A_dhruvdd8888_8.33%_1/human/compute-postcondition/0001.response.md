To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the string `s`. 

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is an empty list, `ps` is 0. These states do not ensure that the loop will execute, so we need to adjust them.

Since `s` must not be empty for the loop to execute, we can adjust the state of `s` to be a non-empty string. Also, `i` is the loop variable, so it should be the first character of the string `s`.

State: **`stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a non-empty string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is an empty list, `ps` is 0, `i` is the first character of `s`**
