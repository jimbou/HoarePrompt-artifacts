Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a non-empty string of length at least 3 consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases. If the third character `i` of `s` is in the set `us` and the length of `win` is equal to `k`, then `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the first three characters of `s`, and `ps` is 3. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
