Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is an empty string, `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing all the characters in `s` that are in `us` and are the `kth` character in a subsequence of `s` consisting of characters in `us`, `ps` is the number of times a subsequence of `s` consisting of characters in `us` has length `k`, `i` is the last character of `s` and is also in the set `us`.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the string `s` will be empty because all its characters have been processed, the set `us` remains unchanged, the set `win` is empty because it is cleared whenever its length becomes equal to `k`, the list `ans` contains all the characters in `s` that are in `us` and are the `kth` character in a subsequence of `s` consisting of characters in `us`, the variable `ps` is the number of times a subsequence of `s` consisting of characters in `us` has length `k`, and the variable `i` is the last character of `s` and is also in the set `us`.
