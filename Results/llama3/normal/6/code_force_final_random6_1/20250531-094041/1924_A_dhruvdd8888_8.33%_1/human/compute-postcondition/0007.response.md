Postcondition: ***`stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a non-empty string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. If the first character of `s` is in `us`, then if the length of `win` is equal to `k`, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the first character of `s`, `ps` is 1, and `i` is the first character of `s` and is also in the set `us`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
