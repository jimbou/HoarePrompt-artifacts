The code adds the character `i` to the set `win`. Since `i` is the first character of `s` and is also in the set `us`, it means that `i` is one of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

Output State: **`stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a non-empty string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `win` is a set containing the first character of `s`, `ans` is an empty list, `ps` is 0, and `i` is the first character of `s` and is also in the set `us`.**
