Output State: **nabors is at least 1, n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, aa is a list of n-1 integers, bb is a list of m integers, cnt_aa is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in aa[:m], cnt_bb is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in bb, D is a Counter object containing the common elements between cnt_aa and cnt_bb, E is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_aa that are not in D, C is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_bb that are not in D, tot is an integer equal to the sum of the values in D, fnd is an integer equal to 1 if tot is greater than or equal to k, otherwise 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `aa`, `bb`, `cnt_aa`, `cnt_bb`, `D`, `E`, `C`, `tot`, and `fnd` are determined by the execution of the code. The value of `nabors` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, as one test case has been processed by the code.
