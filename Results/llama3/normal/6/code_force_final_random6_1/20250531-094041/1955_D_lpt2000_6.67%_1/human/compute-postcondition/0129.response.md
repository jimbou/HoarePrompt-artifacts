Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than `m`, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `aa` is a list of n integers, `bb` is a list of m integers, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the first m elements of aa, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in bb, `D` is a Counter object containing the common elements between cnt_aa and cnt_bb, `E` is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_aa that are not in D, `C` is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_bb that are not in D, `tot` is an integer equal to the sum of the values in D, `fnd` is an integer equal to 1 if tot is greater than or equal to k, otherwise 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus n - m - 1 test cases, `in_aa` is the second element of aa[m:], `out_aa` is the second element of aa[:n - m]. If the frequency of out_aa in D is greater than 0, then the frequency of out_aa in E is decreased by 1 if it exists, otherwise the count of out_aa in D is decreased by 1 and the count of out_aa in C is increased by 1. If the frequency of out_aa in D is 0, then the count of out_aa in E is decreased by 1. If C[in_aa] is equal to D[in_aa], then the count of in_aa in C is increased by 1. Otherwise, D[in_aa] is increased by 1.***
