Output State: **`nabors` is at least 1, `n` is an integer greater than `m`, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `aa` is a list of `n` integers, `bb` is a list of `m` integers, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in `aa[:m+1]`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the common elements between `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `E` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_aa` that are not in `D` and `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1, `C` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_bb` that are not in `D`, `tot` is an integer equal to the sum of the values in `D`, `fnd` is an integer equal to 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `in_aa` is `aa[m + 1]`, `out_aa` is `aa[m]`. If `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0, then the count of `out_aa` in `E` is decreased by 1 if it exists, otherwise the count of `out_aa` in `D` is decreased by 1 and the count of `out_aa` in `C` is increased by 1. If `D[out_aa]` is 0, then the count of `out_aa` in `E` is decreased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `E[in_aa]` has been increased by 1, and the other variables remain unchanged. The count of `in_aa` in `E` is now one more than its previous value. All other variables retain their previous values and properties.
