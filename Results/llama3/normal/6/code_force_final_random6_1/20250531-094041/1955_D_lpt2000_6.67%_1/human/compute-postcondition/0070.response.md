Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are integers, `aa` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least `m` elements, `bb` is a list of `m` integers, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the common elements between `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `E` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_aa` that are not in `D`, `C` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_bb` that are not in `D`, `tot` is an integer equal to the sum of the values in `D`, `fnd` is an integer equal to 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `in_aa` is the next element in `aa` after the first `m` elements, `out_aa` is the next element in `aa` after the first `m` elements. If `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0, then `C[in_aa]` is equal to `D[in_aa]` plus 1 if `C[in_aa]` is equal to `D[in_aa]`, otherwise `D[in_aa]` is incremented by 1. If `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0, then `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 if `E[out_aa]` is greater than 0, otherwise `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1 and `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1. If `D[out_aa]` is 0, then `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. If `C[in_aa]` is 0, then `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1.***
