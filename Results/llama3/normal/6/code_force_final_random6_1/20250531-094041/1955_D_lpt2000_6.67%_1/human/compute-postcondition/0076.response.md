Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers, `aa` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least `m + 2` elements, `bb` is a list of `m` integers, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the first `m + 1` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the common elements between `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `E` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_aa` that are not in `D`, `C` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_bb` that are not in `D`, `tot` is an integer equal to the sum of the values in `D`, `fnd` is an integer equal to 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `in_aa` is the next element in `aa` after the first `m + 1` elements, `out_aa` is the next element in `aa` after the first `m + 1` elements, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `E[out_aa]` has been decreased by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
