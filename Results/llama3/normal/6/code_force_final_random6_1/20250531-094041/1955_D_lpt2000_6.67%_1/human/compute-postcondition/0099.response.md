State: **n, m, k are integers, aa is a list of n integers, bb is a list of m integers, cnt_aa is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in aa, cnt_bb is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in bb, D is a Counter object containing the common elements between cnt_aa and cnt_bb, E is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_aa that are not in D, C is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_bb that are not in D, tot is an integer equal to the sum of the values in D, fnd is an integer equal to 1 if tot is greater than or equal to k, otherwise 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus n - m - 1 test cases, in_aa is the last element in aa, out_aa is the last element in aa, and the value of fnd is printed, which is 1 if the sum of the common elements between cnt_aa and cnt_bb is greater than or equal to k, otherwise 0**
