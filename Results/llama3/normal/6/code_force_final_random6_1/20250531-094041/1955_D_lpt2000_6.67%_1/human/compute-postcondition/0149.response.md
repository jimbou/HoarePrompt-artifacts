Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers n, m, and k, followed by n integers a_1 to a_n, and then m integers b_1 to b_m. It then calculates the number of positions where the sum of common elements between the first m elements of a_1 to a_n and b_1 to b_m is greater than or equal to k, as the window of the first m elements of a_1 to a_n slides over the rest of the list. The function prints the count of such positions for each test case.**
