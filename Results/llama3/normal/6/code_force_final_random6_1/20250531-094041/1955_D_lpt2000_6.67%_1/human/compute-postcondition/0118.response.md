Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than `m`, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `aa` is a list of `n` integers, `bb` is a list of `m` integers, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the common elements between `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `E` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_aa` that are not in `D`, `C` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_bb` that are not in `D`, `tot` is an integer equal to the sum of the values in `D`, `fnd` is an integer equal to 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n - m - 1` test cases, `in_aa` is the first element of `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the first element of `aa[:n - m]`. If `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0, then if `E[out_aa]` is greater than 0, `E[out_aa]` is set to 0. Otherwise, `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1 and `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1. If `D[out_aa]` is 0, then the count of `out_aa` in `E` is decreased by 1. The count of `in_aa` in `C` is 0, and the count of `in_aa` in `E` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `aa`, `bb`, `cnt_aa`, `cnt_bb`, `D`, `C`, `tot`, `fnd`, `stdin`, `in_aa`, and `out_aa` remain the same as in the initial state. The count of `in_aa` in `E` is increased by 1.
