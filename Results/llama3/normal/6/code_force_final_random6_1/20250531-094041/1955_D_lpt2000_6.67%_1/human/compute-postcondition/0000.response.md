Output State: **`nabors` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three integers n, m, and k (1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5), followed by n-1 integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n-1 (1 <= a_i <= 10^6), and then m integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_m (1 <= b_i <= 10^6). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**

In this output state, the value of `nabors` is an integer that was read from the input, which was the first integer of the first test case. The stdin still contains the rest of the input, which includes the remaining integers of the first test case and all the integers of the subsequent test cases.
