Output State: **n is an integer greater than m, m is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer, aa is a list of n integers, bb is a list of m integers, cnt_aa is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the first m elements of aa, cnt_bb is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in bb, D is a Counter object containing the common elements between cnt_aa and cnt_bb with the count of out_aa decreased by 1, E is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_aa that are not in D, C is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_bb that are not in D with the count of out_aa increased by 1, tot is an integer equal to the sum of the values in D, fnd is an integer equal to 1 if tot is greater than or equal to k, otherwise 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus n - m - 1 test cases, in_aa is the second element of aa[m:], out_aa is the second element of aa[:n - m].**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `aa`, `bb`, `cnt_aa`, `cnt_bb`, `E`, `tot`, `fnd`, `stdin`, and `in_aa` remain unchanged. The only modifications are in the Counter objects `D` and `C`. The count of `out_aa` in `D` is decreased by 1, and the count of `out_aa` in `C` is increased by 1.
