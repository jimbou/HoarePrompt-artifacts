Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, aa is a list of n integers, bb is a list of m integers, cnt_aa is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the first m elements of aa, cnt_bb is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in bb, D is a Counter object containing the common elements between cnt_aa and cnt_bb, E is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_aa that are not in D, C is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_bb that are not in D, tot is an integer equal to the sum of the values in D, fnd is an integer equal to 1 if tot is greater than or equal to k, otherwise 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, in_aa is aa[m-1], out_aa is bb[m-1].
Code of the loop:
for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
    if D[out_aa] > 0:
        if E[out_aa] > 0:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        else:
            D[out_aa] -= 1
            C[out_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[out_aa] -= 1
    if C[in_aa] > 0:
        if C[in_aa] == D[in_aa]:
            C[in_aa] += 1
        else:
            D[in_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[in_aa] += 1
    tot = sum(D.values())
    fnd += 1 if tot >= k else 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n, m, k are integers, aa is a list of n integers that must have at least m elements, bb is a list of m integers, cnt_aa is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the first m elements of aa, cnt_bb is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in bb, D is a Counter object containing the common elements between cnt_aa and cnt_bb, E is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_aa that are not in D, C is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_bb that are not in D, tot is an integer equal to the sum of the values in D, fnd is an integer equal to 1 if tot is greater than or equal to k, otherwise 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, in_aa is the next element in aa after the first m elements, out_aa is the next element in aa after the first m elements. If C[in_aa] is greater than 0, then C[in_aa] is equal to D[in_aa] plus 1 if C[in_aa] is equal to D[in_aa], otherwise D[in_aa] is incremented by 1. If D[out_aa] is greater than 0, then E[out_aa] is decreased by 1 if E[out_aa] is greater than 0, otherwise D[out_aa] is decremented by 1 and C[out_aa] is incremented by 1. If D[out_aa] is 0, then E[out_aa] is decreased by 1. If C[in_aa] is 0, then E[in_aa] is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n, m, k are integers, aa is a list of n integers that must have at least m + 2 elements, bb is a list of m integers, cnt_aa is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the first m + 1 elements of aa, cnt_bb is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in bb, D is a Counter object containing the common elements between cnt_aa and cnt_bb, E is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_aa that are not in D, C is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_bb that are not in D, tot is an integer equal to the sum of the values in D, fnd is an integer equal to 1 if tot is greater than or equal to k, otherwise 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, in_aa is the next element in aa after the first m + 1 elements, out_aa is the next element in aa after the first m + 1 elements. If C[in_aa] is greater than 0, then C[in_aa] is equal to D[in_aa] plus 1 if C[in_aa] is equal to D[in_aa], otherwise D[in_aa] is incremented by 1. If D[out_aa] is greater than 0, then E[out_aa] is decreased by 1 if E[out_aa] is greater than 0, otherwise D[out_aa] is decremented by 1 and C[out_aa] is incremented by 1. If D[out_aa] is 0, then E[out_aa] is decreased by 1. If C[in_aa] is 0, then E[in_aa] is increased by 1. If C[in_aa] is equal to D[in_aa], then C[in_aa] is incremented by 1. Otherwise, D[in_aa] is incremented by 1 and tot is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n, m, k are integers, aa is a list of n integers that must have at least m + 3 elements, bb is a list of m integers, cnt_aa is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the first m + 2 elements of aa, cnt_bb is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in bb, D is a Counter object containing the common elements between cnt_aa and cnt_bb, E is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_aa that are not in D, C is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_bb that are not in D, tot is an integer equal to the sum of the values in D, fnd is an integer equal to 1 if tot is greater than or equal to k, otherwise 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, in_aa is the next element in aa after the first m + 2 elements, out_aa is the next element in aa after the first m + 2 elements.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
