Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than m, m is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer, aa is a list of n integers, bb is a list of m integers, cnt_aa is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the first m elements of aa, cnt_bb is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in bb, D is a Counter object containing the common elements between cnt_aa and cnt_bb, E is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_aa that are not in D, C is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_bb that are not in D, tot is an integer equal to the sum of the values in D, fnd is an integer equal to 1 if tot is greater than or equal to k, otherwise 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus n - m - 2 test cases, in_aa is the third element of aa[m:], out_aa is the third element of aa[:n - m]. If out_aa is in D, the count of out_aa in D is decreased by 1. If out_aa is in E, the count of out_aa in E is decreased by 1. If out_aa is not in D and not in E, the count of out_aa in D is decreased by 1 and the count of out_aa in C is increased by 1.***
