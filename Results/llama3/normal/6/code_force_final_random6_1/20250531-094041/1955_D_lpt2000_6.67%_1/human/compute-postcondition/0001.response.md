To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the variable `nabors`. The loop will execute if `nabors` is at least 1. Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`nabors` is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three integers n, m, and k (1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5), followed by n-1 integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n-1 (1 <= a_i <= 10^6), and then m integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_m (1 <= b_i <= 10^6). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
