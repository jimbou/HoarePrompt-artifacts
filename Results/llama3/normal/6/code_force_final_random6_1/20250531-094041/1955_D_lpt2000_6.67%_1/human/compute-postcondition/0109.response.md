Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than `m`, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `aa` is a list of `n` integers, `bb` is a list of `m` integers, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the common elements between `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `E` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_aa` that are not in `D`, `C` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_bb` that are not in `D`, `tot` is an integer equal to the sum of the values in `D`, `fnd` is an integer equal to 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n - m - 1` test cases, `in_aa` is the first element of `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the first element of `aa[:n - m]`. The count of `out_aa` in `D` is 0, and the count of `out_aa` in `E` is decreased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the count of `out_aa` in `E` is decreased by 1. This means that the frequency of `out_aa` in the elements of `cnt_aa` that are not in `D` is reduced by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
