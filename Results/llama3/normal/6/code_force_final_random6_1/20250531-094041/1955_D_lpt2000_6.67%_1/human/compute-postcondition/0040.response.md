Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than m+1, m is an integer incremented by 1, k is an integer, aa is a list of n integers, bb is a list of m+1 integers, cnt_aa is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in aa[:m+1] or aa[:m+2], cnt_bb is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in bb, D is a Counter object containing the common elements between cnt_aa and cnt_bb, E is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_aa that are not in D, C is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_bb that are not in D, tot is an integer equal to the sum of the values in D, fnd is an integer equal to 1 if tot is greater than or equal to k, otherwise 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, in_aa is aa[m + 2], out_aa is aa[m+1]. If D[in_aa] is greater than 0, then the count of in_aa in C is increased by 1 if C[in_aa] is not equal to D[in_aa], and the count of in_aa in D is increased by 1 if C[in_aa] is not equal to D[in_aa]. If C[in_aa] is 0, then the count of in_aa in E is increased by 1. If D[out_aa] is greater than 0, then the count of out_aa in E is decreased by 1 if it exists, otherwise the count of out_aa in D is decreased by 1 and the count of out_aa in C is increased by 1. If D[out_aa] is 0, then the count of out_aa in E is decreased by 1. If E[out_aa] is greater than 0, then the count of out_aa in E is decreased by 1. Otherwise, D[out_aa] is decreased by 1, C[out_aa] is increased by 1.***
