Reasoning: The given program is correct. It correctly implements the sliding window approach to count the number of good subsegments of array a. The program initializes the counters for the first window of size m, then slides the window to the right, updating the counters and the total count of matching elements. The program correctly handles the cases where an element is added or removed from the window, and it correctly updates the total count of matching elements. The program also correctly prints the total count of good subsegments.

Correctness: **True**
