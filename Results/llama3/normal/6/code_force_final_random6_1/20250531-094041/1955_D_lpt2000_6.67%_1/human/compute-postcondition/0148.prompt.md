Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `nabors` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three integers n, m, and k (1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5), followed by n-1 integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n-1 (1 <= a_i <= 10^6), and then m integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_m (1 <= b_i <= 10^6). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(nabors):
    n, m, k = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    aa = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    bb = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    cnt_aa = Counter(aa[:m])
    cnt_bb = Counter(bb)
    D = cnt_aa & cnt_bb
    E = cnt_aa - D
    C = cnt_bb - D
    tot = sum(D.values())
    fnd = 1 if tot >= k else 0
    for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
        if D[out_aa] > 0:
            if E[out_aa] > 0:
                E[out_aa] -= 1
            else:
                D[out_aa] -= 1
                C[out_aa] += 1
        else:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        if C[in_aa] > 0:
            if C[in_aa] == D[in_aa]:
                C[in_aa] += 1
            else:
                D[in_aa] += 1
        else:
            E[in_aa] += 1
        tot = sum(D.values())
        fnd += 1 if tot >= k else 0
    print(fnd)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer greater than m, m is an integer, k is an integer, aa is a list of n integers, bb is a list of m integers, cnt_aa is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in aa, cnt_bb is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in bb, D is a Counter object containing the common elements between cnt_aa and cnt_bb, E is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_aa that are not in D, C is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_bb that are not in D, tot is an integer equal to the sum of the values in D, fnd is an integer equal to 1 if tot is greater than or equal to k, otherwise 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, in_aa is aa[n-1], out_aa is aa[m-1]. If D[out_aa] is greater than 0, then the count of out_aa in E is decreased by 1 if it exists, otherwise the count of out_aa in D is decreased by 1 and the count of out_aa in C is increased by 1. If D[out_aa] is 0, then the count of out_aa in E is decreased by 1. If C[in_aa] is greater than 0, then the count of in_aa in C is increased by 1 if C[in_aa] is not equal to D[in_aa], and the count of in_aa in D is increased by 1 if C[in_aa] is equal to D[in_aa]. If C[in_aa] is 0, then the count of in_aa in E is increased by 1, and fnd is printed, where fnd is 1 if the sum of the values in D is greater than or equal to k, otherwise 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n, m, k are integers, aa is a list of n integers, bb is a list of m integers, cnt_aa is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in aa, cnt_bb is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in bb, D is a Counter object containing the common elements between cnt_aa and cnt_bb, E is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_aa that are not in D, C is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_bb that are not in D, tot is an integer equal to the sum of the values in D, fnd is an integer equal to 1 if tot is greater than or equal to k, otherwise 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus n - m test cases, in_aa is the last element in aa, out_aa is the last element in aa, and the value of fnd is printed, which is 1 if the sum of the common elements between cnt_aa and cnt_bb is greater than or equal to k, otherwise 0

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer greater than m, m is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer, aa is a list of n integers, bb is a list of m integers, cnt_aa is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the first m elements of aa, cnt_bb is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in bb, D is a Counter object containing the common elements between cnt_aa and cnt_bb, E is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_aa that are not in D, C is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_bb that are not in D, tot is an integer equal to the sum of the values in D, fnd is an integer equal to 1 if tot is greater than or equal to k, otherwise 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus n - m test cases, in_aa is the last element of aa[m:], out_aa is the last element of aa[:n - m], and the value of fnd which is 1 if the sum of the values in D is greater than or equal to k, otherwise 0 is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
