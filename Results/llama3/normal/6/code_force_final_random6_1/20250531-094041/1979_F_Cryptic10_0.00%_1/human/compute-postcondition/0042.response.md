Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 1, d is -2, v and u are integers returned by func_1 when d is input, path is a list containing the integers v and v, remaining_vertices is a set of integers from 1 to n (inclusive) with v removed.**

The code snippet modifies the state of the program by appending the value of `v` to the `path` list, removing `v` from the `remaining_vertices` set, and breaking out of the loop. The values of `n`, `d`, `v`, and `u` remain unchanged. The `path` list now contains two elements: the original value of `v` and the new value of `v` appended by the code. The `remaining_vertices` set is updated by removing the value of `v`, but its original range and non-emptiness are preserved.
