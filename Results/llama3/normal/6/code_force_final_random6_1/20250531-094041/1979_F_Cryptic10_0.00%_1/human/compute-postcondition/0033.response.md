Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `func_1` is a function that takes an integer `d` as input and returns a tuple of two integers (`v`, `u`), `d` is -1, `v` and `u` are integers returned by `func_1` when `d` is input, `path` is a list containing the integer `v` and `remaining_vertices` is a non-empty set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) with `v` removed.**

In this output state, the values of `v` and `u` have been updated to the integers returned by `func_1` when `d` is input. The other variables remain unchanged.
