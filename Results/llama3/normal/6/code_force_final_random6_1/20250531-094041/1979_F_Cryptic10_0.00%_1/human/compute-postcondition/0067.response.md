Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, func_1 is a function that takes an integer d as input and returns a tuple of two integers (v, u), path is a list containing all integers from 1 to n (inclusive) in the order they were removed from remaining_vertices, remaining_vertices is an empty set.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable 'n' remains unchanged as a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, the function 'func_1' remains unchanged, the list 'path' contains all integers from 1 to 'n' in the order they were removed from 'remaining_vertices', and 'remaining_vertices' becomes an empty set.
