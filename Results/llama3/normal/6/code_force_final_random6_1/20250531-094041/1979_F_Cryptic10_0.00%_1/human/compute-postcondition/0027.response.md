Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `func_1` is a function that takes an integer d as input and returns a tuple of two integers (v, u), `path` is a list containing the integer v if v was previously in the set of remaining_vertices, otherwise path is an empty list, `remaining_vertices` is a non-empty set of integers from 1 to n (inclusive) with v removed if v was previously in the set of remaining_vertices, `d` is at least 0, `v` is an integer returned by func_1 when d is input, `u` is an integer returned by func_1 when d is input, and the current value of `v` is 0, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged, and the loop continues to the next iteration.
