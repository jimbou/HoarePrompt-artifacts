Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer greater than 1, func_1 is a function that takes an integer d as input and returns a tuple of two integers (v, u), path is a list containing the integer v if v was previously in the set of remaining_vertices, otherwise path is an empty list, remaining_vertices is a non-empty set of integers from 1 to n (inclusive) with v removed if v was previously in the set of remaining_vertices, d is -1, v is an integer not equal to 0, u is an integer returned by func_1 when d is -1
Code of the loop:
for d in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    v, u = func_1(d)
    if v == 0:
        continue
    if v in remaining_vertices:
        path.append(v)
        remaining_vertices.remove(v)
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `func_1` is a function that takes an integer `d` as input and returns a tuple of two integers (`v`, `u`), `d` is at least 0, `v` is an integer returned by `func_1` when `d` is input, `u` is an integer returned by `func_1` when `d` is input. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, then `path` is a list containing the integer `v` and `remaining_vertices` is a non-empty set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) with `v` removed. Otherwise, `path` and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is a positive integer greater than 1, func_1 is a function that takes an integer d as input and returns a tuple of two integers (v, u), d is -1, v and u are integers returned by func_1 when d is input, path is a list containing the integer v, if v is in remaining_vertices, then remaining_vertices is a non-empty set of integers from 1 to n (inclusive) with v removed. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `d` is -2, `v` and `u` are integers returned by `func_1` when `d` is input, `path` is a list containing the integer `v`. If `v` is 0, then we skip to the next iteration of the loop. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, then `remaining_vertices` is a non-empty set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) with `v` removed and `path` is a list containing the integers `v` and `v`. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
