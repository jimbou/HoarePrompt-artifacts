To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states accordingly.

The loop head is `for d in range(n - 1, -1, -1):`. This means that the loop will iterate from `n-1` down to `-1` with a step of `-1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `d` is `-1`. For the loop to execute again, `d` should be the next value in the range, which is `-2`.

The only variable in the loop head is `d`, so we can only adjust its state.

State: **n is a positive integer greater than 1, func_1 is a function that takes an integer d as input and returns a tuple of two integers (v, u), d is -2, v and u are integers returned by func_1 when d is input, path is a list containing the integer v, if v is in remaining_vertices, then remaining_vertices is a non-empty set of integers from 1 to n (inclusive) with v removed. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
