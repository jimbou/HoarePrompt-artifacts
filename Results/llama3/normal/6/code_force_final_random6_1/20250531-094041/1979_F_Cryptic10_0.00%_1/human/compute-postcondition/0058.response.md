Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 1, func_1 is a function that takes an integer d as input and returns a tuple of two integers (v, u), d is n-2, v is an integer returned by func_1 when d is n-2, u is an integer returned by func_1 when d is n-2, path is a list containing the integer v, remaining_vertices is a non-empty set of integers from 1 to n (inclusive) with v removed.**

The code snippet modifies the `path` and `remaining_vertices` variables. The first line appends the value of `v` to the `path` list. The second line removes the value of `v` from the `remaining_vertices` set. The `break` statement exits the current loop iteration, but since we are not provided with the loop structure, we cannot determine the exact impact on the loop. However, we can conclude that the loop will move on to the next iteration.

The values of `n`, `func_1`, `d`, `v`, and `u` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code snippet. The `path` list now contains the integer `v`, and the `remaining_vertices` set has been updated to exclude the value of `v`.
