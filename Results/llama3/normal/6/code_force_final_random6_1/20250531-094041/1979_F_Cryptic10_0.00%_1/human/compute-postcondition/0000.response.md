Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, func_1 is a function that takes an integer d as input and returns a tuple of two integers (v, u), path is an empty list, remaining_vertices is a set of integers from 1 to n (inclusive).**

In this output state, the initial values of `n` and `func_1` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The code introduces two new variables: `path` and `remaining_vertices`. `path` is initialized as an empty list, and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing all integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), where `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2.
