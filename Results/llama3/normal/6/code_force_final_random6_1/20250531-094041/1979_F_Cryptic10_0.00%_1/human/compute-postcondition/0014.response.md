Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, func_1 is a function that takes an integer d as input and returns a tuple of two integers (v, u), path is a list containing the integer v, remaining_vertices is a set of integers from 1 to n (inclusive) with v removed, d is n-2, v and u are integers returned by func_1 when d is n-2.**

The code snippet modifies the state of the variables as follows:

*   The `path` list now contains the integer `v` that was previously in the set of `remaining_vertices`.
*   The `remaining_vertices` set has the integer `v` removed from it.
*   The values of `n`, `func_1`, `d`, `v`, and `u` remain unchanged.

The loop breaks after the current iteration, so the values of `v`, `u`, `path`, and `remaining_vertices` are updated based on the current values of `v` and `u` returned by `func_1` when `d` is `n-2`.
