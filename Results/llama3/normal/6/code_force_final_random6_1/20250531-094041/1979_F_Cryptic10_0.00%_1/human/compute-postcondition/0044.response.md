Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 1, func_1 is a function that takes an integer d as input and returns a tuple of two integers (v, u), path is a list containing the integer v if v was previously in the set of remaining_vertices, otherwise path is an empty list, remaining_vertices is a non-empty set of integers from 1 to n (inclusive) with v removed if v was previously in the set of remaining_vertices, d is -1, v is an integer not equal to 0, u is an integer returned by func_1 when d is -1**

This output state means that after the loop has finished executing, the value of `n` remains unchanged, `func_1` remains the same function, `path` will contain the integer `v` if `v` was previously in the set of `remaining_vertices`, otherwise it will be an empty list, `remaining_vertices` will be a non-empty set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) with `v` removed if `v` was previously in the set of `remaining_vertices`, `d` will be -1, `v` will be an integer not equal to 0, and `u` will be an integer returned by `func_1` when `d` is -1.
