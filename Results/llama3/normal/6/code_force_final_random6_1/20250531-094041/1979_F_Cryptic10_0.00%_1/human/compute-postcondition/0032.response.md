The only variable in the loop head is variable  d, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `d`. If `d` is greater than -1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `d` is at least 0. For the loop to execute again, `d` must be decreased by 1, so `d` is -1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `func_1` is a function that takes an integer `d` as input and returns a tuple of two integers (`v`, `u`), `d` is -1, `v` is an integer returned by `func_1` when `d` is input, `u` is an integer returned by `func_1` when `d` is input, `path` is a list containing the integer `v` and `remaining_vertices` is a non-empty set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) with `v` removed.**
