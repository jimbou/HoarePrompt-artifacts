Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, func_1 is a function that takes an integer d as input and returns a tuple of two integers (v, u), path is a list containing the integer v if v was previously in the set of remaining_vertices, otherwise path is an empty list, remaining_vertices is a set of integers from 1 to n (inclusive) with v removed if v was previously in the set of remaining_vertices, d is -1, v is an integer not equal to 0, u is an integer returned by func_1 when d is -1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: The loop has finished executing, and the value of `d` is now `-1`. The value of `v` is an integer not equal to `0`, and the value of `u` is an integer returned by `func_1` when `d` is `-1`. The list `path` contains the integer `v` if `v` was previously in the set of `remaining_vertices`, otherwise it is an empty list. The set `remaining_vertices` has been updated to remove `v` if it was previously in the set. The function `func_1` and the integer `n` remain unchanged.
