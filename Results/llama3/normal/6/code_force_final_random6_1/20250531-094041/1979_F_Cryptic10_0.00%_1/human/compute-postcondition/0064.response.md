Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 2, func_1 is a function that takes an integer d as input and returns a tuple of two integers (v, u), d is n-3, v and u are integers returned by func_1 when d is n-3, path is a list containing the integer v, and remaining_vertices is a non-empty set of integers from 1 to n (inclusive) with v removed.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The function `func_1` also remains unchanged as it is not modified or called in the code. The value of `d` remains `n-3` as it is not modified by the code. The values of `v` and `u` remain the same as they are not modified by the code. The list `path` now contains the integer `v` as it is appended to the list in the code. The set `remaining_vertices` is updated to remove the integer `v` as it is removed in the code.
