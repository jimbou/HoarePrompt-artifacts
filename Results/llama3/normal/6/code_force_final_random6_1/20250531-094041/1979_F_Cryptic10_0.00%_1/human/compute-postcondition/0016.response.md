To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the state of the variable `d` in the loop head. According to the code, the loop will execute again if `d` is greater than or equal to 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, `d` is `n-2`. To execute the loop again, `d` must be decremented by 1, so `d` becomes `n-3`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `func_1` is a function that takes an integer `d` as input and returns a tuple of two integers `(v, u)`, `d` is `n-3`, `v` and `u` are integers returned by `func_1` when `d` is `n-3`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, then `path` is a list containing the integer `v` and `remaining_vertices` is a set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) with `v` removed. Otherwise, `path` and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged.**
