Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `func_1` is a function that takes an integer `d` as input and returns a tuple of two integers `(v, u)`, `d` is `n-3`, `v` and `u` are integers returned by `func_1` when `d` is `n-3`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, then `path` is a list containing the integer `v` and `remaining_vertices` is a set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) with `v` removed. Otherwise, `path` and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but with the values of `v` and `u` updated to the return values of `func_1` when `d` is `n-3`. The values of `path` and `remaining_vertices` are updated only if `v` is in `remaining_vertices`.
