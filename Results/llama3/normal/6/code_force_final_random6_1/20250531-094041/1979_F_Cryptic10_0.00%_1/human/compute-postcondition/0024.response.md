The only variable in the loop head is variable  d, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `d`. If `d` is at least 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `d` is -1 which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `d` is at least 0. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `func_1` is a function that takes an integer d as input and returns a tuple of two integers (v, u), `path` is a list containing the integer v if v was previously in the set of remaining_vertices, otherwise path is an empty list, `remaining_vertices` is a non-empty set of integers from 1 to n (inclusive) with v removed if v was previously in the set of remaining_vertices, `d` is at least 0, `v` is an integer not equal to 0, `u` is an integer returned by func_1 when d is -1**
