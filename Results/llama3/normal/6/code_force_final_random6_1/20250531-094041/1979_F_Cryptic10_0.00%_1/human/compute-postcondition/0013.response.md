Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `func_1` is a function that takes an integer `d` as input and returns a tuple of two integers `(v, u)`, `path` is a list containing the integer `v` if `v` was previously in the set of `remaining_vertices`, otherwise `path` is an empty list, `remaining_vertices` is a set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) with `v` removed if `v` was previously in the set of `remaining_vertices`, `d` is `n-2`, `v` and `u` are integers returned by `func_1` when `d` is `n-2`. If `v` is 0, the loop skips to the next iteration. Otherwise, the loop continues with the current values of `v`, `u`, `path`, and `remaining_vertices`.***
