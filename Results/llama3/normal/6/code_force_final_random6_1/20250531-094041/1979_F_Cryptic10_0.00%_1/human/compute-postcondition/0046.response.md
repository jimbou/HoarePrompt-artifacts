To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `d` and the range defined by `n-1`, `-1`, and `-1` (the start, stop, and step values respectively).

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n-1` is greater than or equal to `-1`, since the loop iterates from `n-1` down to `-1` with a step of `-1`. Given that `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `n-1` will always be greater than or equal to `-1`, ensuring the loop can execute.

However, to make the loop execute at least once, `n-1` must be greater than `-1`. This condition is already met since `n` is a positive integer greater than 1.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to set `d` to `n-1`, which is the starting value of the loop.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `func_1` is a function that takes an integer d as input and returns a tuple of two integers (v, u), `path` is a list containing the integer v if v was previously in the set of remaining_vertices, otherwise path is an empty list, `remaining_vertices` is a non-empty set of integers from 1 to n (inclusive) with v removed if v was previously in the set of remaining_vertices and it must have at least one element, `d` is n-1, `v` is an integer not equal to 0, `u` is an integer returned by func_1 when d is -1**
