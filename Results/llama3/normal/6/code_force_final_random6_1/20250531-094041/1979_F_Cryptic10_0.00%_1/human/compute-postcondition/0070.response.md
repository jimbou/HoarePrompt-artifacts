Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `func_1` is a function that takes an integer `d` as input and returns a tuple of two integers `(v, u)`, `path` is a list containing all integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) in the order they were removed from `remaining_vertices`, `remaining_vertices` is an empty set, and the output buffer has been flushed.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that the output buffer has been flushed, meaning that any pending output has been written to the console. The values of `n`, `func_1`, `path`, and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged.
