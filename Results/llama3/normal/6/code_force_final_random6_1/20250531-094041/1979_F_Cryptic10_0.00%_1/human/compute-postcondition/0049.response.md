Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `func_1` is a function that takes an integer `d` as input and returns a tuple of two integers `(v, u)`, `path` is a list containing the integer `v` if `v` was previously in the set of `remaining_vertices`, otherwise `path` is an empty list, `remaining_vertices` is a non-empty set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) with `v` removed if `v` was previously in the set of `remaining_vertices` and it must have at least one element, `d` is `n-1`, `v` is an integer returned by `func_1` when `d` is `n-1`, `u` is an integer returned by `func_1` when `d` is `n-1`, and the current value of `v` is 0, and we skip the rest of the code in the current loop iteration.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip the rest of the code in the current loop iteration due to the `continue` statement. The values of the variables remain unchanged, and the program moves on to the next iteration of the loop.
