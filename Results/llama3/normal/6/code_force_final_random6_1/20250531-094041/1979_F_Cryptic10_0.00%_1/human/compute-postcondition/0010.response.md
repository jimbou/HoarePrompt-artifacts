The only variable in the loop head is variable `d`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `d`. If `d` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `d` is `n-1`. For the loop to execute again, `d` must be `n-2`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `func_1` is a function that takes an integer `d` as input and returns a tuple of two integers `(v, u)`, `path` is a list containing the integer `v` if `v` was previously in the set of `remaining_vertices`, otherwise `path` is an empty list, `remaining_vertices` is a set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) with `v` removed if `v` was previously in the set of `remaining_vertices`, `d` is `n-2`, `v` is an integer not equal to 0, `u` is an integer returned by `func_1` when `d` is `n-1`**
