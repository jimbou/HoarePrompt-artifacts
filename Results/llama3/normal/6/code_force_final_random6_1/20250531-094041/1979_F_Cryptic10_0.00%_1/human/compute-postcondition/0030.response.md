Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 1, func_1 is a function that takes an integer d as input and returns a tuple of two integers (v, u), path is a list containing the integer v, remaining_vertices is a non-empty set of integers from 1 to n (inclusive) with v removed, d is at least 0, v is an integer returned by func_1 when d is input, u is an integer returned by func_1 when d is input.**

The code snippet modifies the `path` and `remaining_vertices` variables. The first line appends the value of `v` to the `path` list, making it a list containing the integer `v`. The second line removes the value of `v` from the `remaining_vertices` set, resulting in a non-empty set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) with `v` removed. The `break` statement does not affect any variables. The other variables (`n`, `func_1`, `d`, `u`) remain unchanged.
