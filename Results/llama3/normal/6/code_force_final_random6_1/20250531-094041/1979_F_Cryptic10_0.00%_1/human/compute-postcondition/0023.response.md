The only variable in the loop head is remaining_vertices, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable remaining_vertices. If remaining_vertices is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, remaining_vertices is a set of integers from 1 to n (inclusive) with v removed if v was previously in the set of remaining_vertices. For the loop to be executed one more time, remaining_vertices must not be empty. Since v was removed from remaining_vertices, we need to ensure that there are still elements left in remaining_vertices. This means that n must be greater than 1, and v must not be the only element in the set of remaining_vertices.

State: **n is a positive integer greater than 1, func_1 is a function that takes an integer d as input and returns a tuple of two integers (v, u), path is a list containing the integer v if v was previously in the set of remaining_vertices, otherwise path is an empty list, remaining_vertices is a non-empty set of integers from 1 to n (inclusive) with v removed if v was previously in the set of remaining_vertices, d is -1, v is an integer not equal to 0, u is an integer returned by func_1 when d is -1**
