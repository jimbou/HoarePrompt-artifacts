The only variable in the loop head is variable  d and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `d`. If `d` is greater than -1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `d` is `n-2` and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `d` must be `n-3` and `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `func_1` is a function that takes an integer `d` as input and returns a tuple of two integers `(v, u)`, `d` is `n-3`, `v` is an integer returned by `func_1` when `d` is `n-3`, `u` is an integer returned by `func_1` when `d` is `n-3`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, then `path` is a list containing the integer `v` and `remaining_vertices` is a non-empty set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) with `v` removed. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, then `path` is an empty list and `remaining_vertices` remains unchanged. If `v` is 0, we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration.**
