Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `func_1` is a function that takes an integer `d` as input and returns a tuple of two integers `(v, u)`, `d` is `n-3`, `v` and `u` are integers returned by `func_1` when `d` is `n-3`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, then `path` is a list containing the integer `v` and `remaining_vertices` is a set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) with `v` removed. Otherwise, `path` and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged. We skip the rest of the code in the current loop iteration and move on to the next iteration.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `func_1`, `d`, `v`, and `u` remain the same as in the initial state. The values of `path` and `remaining_vertices` also remain the same, but we skip the rest of the code in the current loop iteration and move on to the next iteration.
