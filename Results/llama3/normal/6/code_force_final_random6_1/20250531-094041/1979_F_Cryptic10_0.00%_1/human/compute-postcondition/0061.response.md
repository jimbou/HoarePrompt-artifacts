Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `func_1` is a function that takes an integer `d` as input and returns a tuple of two integers `(v, u)`, `d` is `n-3`, `v` and `u` are integers returned by `func_1` when `d` is `n-3`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, then `path` is a list containing the integer `v` and `remaining_vertices` is a non-empty set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) with `v` removed. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, then `path` is an empty list and `remaining_vertices` remains unchanged. If `v` is 0, we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration.**

In this output state, the values of `v` and `u` have been updated to the integers returned by `func_1` when `d` is `n-3`. The values of `n`, `func_1`, and `d` remain unchanged. The values of `path` and `remaining_vertices` depend on whether `v` is in `remaining_vertices` or not. If `v` is 0, the rest of the current iteration of the loop is skipped.
