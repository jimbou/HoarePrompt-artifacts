Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `d` is -2, `v` and `u` are integers returned by `func_1` when `d` is input, `path` is a list containing the integer `v`, if `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, then `remaining_vertices` is a non-empty set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) with `v` removed. Otherwise, no changes are made, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. The values of `n`, `d`, `v`, `u`, `path`, and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged.
