Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, func_1 is a function that takes an integer d as input and returns a tuple of two integers (v, u), path is a list containing the integer v, remaining_vertices is a set of integers from 1 to n (inclusive) with v removed, d is n-1, v is an integer not equal to 0 and previously in the set of remaining_vertices, u is an integer returned by func_1 when d is n-1.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The function `func_1` also remains unchanged as it is not modified or called in the code snippet. The list `path` now contains the integer `v` as it was appended in the first line of the code. The set `remaining_vertices` has been modified by removing the integer `v` in the second line of the code. The value of `d` remains `n-1` as it is not modified by the code. The values of `v` and `u` remain the same as they are not modified by the code, but it is noted that `v` is not equal to 0 and was previously in the set of `remaining_vertices`.
