The only variable in the loop head is variable remaining_vertices, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable remaining_vertices.  If remaining_vertices is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, remaining_vertices is a non-empty set of integers from 1 to n (inclusive) with v removed if v was previously in the set of remaining_vertices. So for the loop to be executed one more time remaining_vertices must be a non-empty set of integers from 1 to n (inclusive) with v removed if v was previously in the set of remaining_vertices and it must have at least one element.
State: **n is a positive integer greater than 1, func_1 is a function that takes an integer d as input and returns a tuple of two integers (v, u), path is a list containing the integer v if v was previously in the set of remaining_vertices, otherwise path is an empty list, remaining_vertices is a non-empty set of integers from 1 to n (inclusive) with v removed if v was previously in the set of remaining_vertices and it must have at least one element, d is -1, v is an integer not equal to 0, u is an integer returned by func_1 when d is -1**
