Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `func_1` is a function that takes an integer `d` as input and returns a tuple of two integers `(v, u)`, `path` is an empty list, `remaining_vertices` is a set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), `d` is `n-1`, `v` and `u` are two integers returned by `func_1` when `d` is `n-1`.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `func_1`, `path`, `remaining_vertices`, and `d` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that `v` and `u` are now assigned the values returned by `func_1` when `d` is `n-1`. The specific values of `v` and `u` depend on the implementation of `func_1`, but they are now defined as the output of `func_1` with input `d=n-1`.
