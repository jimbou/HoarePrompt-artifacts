Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `func_1` is a function that takes an integer `d` as input and returns a tuple of two integers `(v, u)`, `d` is `n-3`, `v` and `u` are integers returned by `func_1` when `d` is `n-3`, `path` is a list containing the integer `v`, and `remaining_vertices` is a set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) with `v` removed.**

In this final state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it was not modified by the code. The function `func_1` also remains unchanged as it was not modified or called in the code snippet. The value of `d` is still `n-3` as it was not updated. The values of `v` and `u` are still the integers returned by `func_1` when `d` is `n-3`, but `v` has been added to the `path` list and removed from the `remaining_vertices` set.
