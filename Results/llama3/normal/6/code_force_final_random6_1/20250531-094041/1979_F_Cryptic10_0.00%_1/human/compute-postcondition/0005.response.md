Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `func_1` is a function that takes an integer `d` as input and returns a tuple of two integers `(v, u)`, `path` is an empty list, `remaining_vertices` is a set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), `d` is `n-1`, `v` is 0, `u` is an integer returned by `func_1` when `d` is `n-1`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In this output state, the values of the variables remain the same as in the initial state, but the program skips to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement.
