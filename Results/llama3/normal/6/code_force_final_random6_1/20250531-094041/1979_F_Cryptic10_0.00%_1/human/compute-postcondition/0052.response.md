Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 1, func_1 is a function that takes an integer d as input and returns a tuple of two integers (v, u), path is a list containing the integer v, remaining_vertices is a non-empty set of integers from 1 to n (inclusive) with v removed, d is n-1, v is an integer returned by func_1 when d is n-1, u is an integer returned by func_1 when d is n-1.**

The code appends the value of `v` to the `path` list and removes `v` from the `remaining_vertices` set. The `break` statement does not affect the state of the variables. The values of `n`, `func_1`, `d`, and `u` remain unchanged.
