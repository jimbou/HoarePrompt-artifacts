Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `d` is -2, `v` and `u` are integers returned by `func_1` when `d` is input, `path` is a list containing the integer `v`. If `v` is 0, then we skip to the next iteration of the loop. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, then `remaining_vertices` is a non-empty set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) with `v` removed. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
