Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `func_1` is a function that takes an integer `d` as input and returns a tuple of two integers `(v, u)`, `path` is a list containing the integer `v` if `v` was previously in the set of `remaining_vertices`, otherwise `path` is an empty list, `remaining_vertices` is a set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) with `v` removed if `v` was previously in the set of `remaining_vertices`, `d` is `n-2`, `v` and `u` are integers returned by `func_1` when `d` is `n-2`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. The values of the variables remain unchanged, and we move on to the next iteration of the loop.
