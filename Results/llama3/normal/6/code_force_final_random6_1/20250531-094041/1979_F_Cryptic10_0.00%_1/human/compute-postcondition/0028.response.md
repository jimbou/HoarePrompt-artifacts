Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `func_1` is a function that takes an integer d as input and returns a tuple of two integers (v, u), `path` is a list containing the integer v if v was previously in the set of remaining_vertices, otherwise path is an empty list, `remaining_vertices` is a non-empty set of integers from 1 to n (inclusive) with v removed if v was previously in the set of remaining_vertices, `d` is at least 0, `v` is an integer returned by func_1 when d is input, `u` is an integer returned by func_1 when d is input. If the current value of `v` is 0, the loop skips to the next iteration. Otherwise, the program continues with the current values of `v` and `u`.***
