Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 1, func_1 is a function that takes an integer d as input and returns a tuple of two integers (v, u), d is -1, v is an integer returned by func_1 when d is -1, u is an integer returned by func_1 when d is -1. If v is in remaining_vertices, then path is a list containing the integer v and remaining_vertices is a non-empty set of integers from 1 to n (inclusive) with v removed. If v is not in remaining_vertices, then path is an empty list and remaining_vertices remains unchanged.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `d` will be -1, and the values of `v` and `u` will be the ones returned by `func_1` when `d` is -1. If `v` is in the set of remaining vertices, then the path will contain `v` and the set of remaining vertices will be updated by removing `v`. If `v` is not in the set of remaining vertices, then the path will be empty and the set of remaining vertices will remain unchanged.
