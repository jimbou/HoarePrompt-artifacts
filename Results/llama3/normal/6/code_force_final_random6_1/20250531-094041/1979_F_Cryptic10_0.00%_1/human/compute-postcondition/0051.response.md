Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `func_1` is a function that takes an integer `d` as input and returns a tuple of two integers `(v, u)`, `path` is a list containing the integer `v` if `v` was previously in the set of `remaining_vertices`, otherwise `path` is an empty list, `remaining_vertices` is a non-empty set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) with `v` removed if `v` was previously in the set of `remaining_vertices` and it must have at least one element, `d` is `n-1`, `v` is an integer returned by `func_1` when `d` is `n-1`, `u` is an integer returned by `func_1` when `d` is `n-1`. The current value of `v` is not 0. The current value of `v` is in the set of `remaining_vertices`.***
