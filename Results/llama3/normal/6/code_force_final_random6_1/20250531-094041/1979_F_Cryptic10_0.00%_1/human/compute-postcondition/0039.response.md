Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `d` is -2, `v` and `u` are integers returned by `func_1` when `d` is input, `path` is a list containing the integer `v`, if `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, then `remaining_vertices` is a non-empty set of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) with `v` removed. Otherwise, no changes are made.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `d`, and `path` remain unchanged. The variables `v` and `u` are assigned the values returned by the function `func_1` when `d` is input. If `v` is in the set `remaining_vertices`, then `remaining_vertices` is updated by removing `v` from the set. Otherwise, `remaining_vertices` remains unchanged.
