Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 1, func_1 is a function that takes an integer d as input and returns a tuple of two integers (v, u), d is -1, v and u are integers returned by func_1 when d is input, path is a list containing the integer v, remaining_vertices is a non-empty set of integers from 1 to n (inclusive) with v removed.**

The code block modifies the state of the variables as follows:

* The line `path.append(v)` adds the integer `v` to the end of the list `path`.
* The line `remaining_vertices.remove(v)` removes the integer `v` from the set `remaining_vertices`.
* The line `break` exits the loop, but since there is no loop in the provided code, this line has no effect.

The values of `n`, `func_1`, `d`, `v`, and `u` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The value of `path` is updated to include the integer `v`, and the value of `remaining_vertices` is updated to exclude the integer `v`.
