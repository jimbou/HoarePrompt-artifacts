The only variable in the loop head is variable remaining_vertices, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable remaining_vertices. If remaining_vertices is not empty, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, remaining_vertices is a set of integers from 1 to n (inclusive), which is not empty because n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, func_1 is a function that takes an integer d as input and returns a tuple of two integers (v, u), path is an empty list, remaining_vertices is a set of integers from 1 to n (inclusive)**
