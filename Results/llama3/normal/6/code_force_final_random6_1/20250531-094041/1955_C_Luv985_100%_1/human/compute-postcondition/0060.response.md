Output State: **T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains T-2 inputs, n is at least 2, a is a list of n integers with a[l] and a[r] decremented by mi. If a[l] is 0, l is 1, r is n-2, ans is 2, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1] after decrementing by mi, and k is reduced by mi * 2. The current value of a[l] is a[1]. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. Additionally, the current value of a[r] is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `r` has been decremented by 1. The value of `a[l]` is still `a[1]`, and the value of `a[r]` is still 0. The values of `T`, `stdin`, `n`, `mi`, and `k` remain unchanged.
