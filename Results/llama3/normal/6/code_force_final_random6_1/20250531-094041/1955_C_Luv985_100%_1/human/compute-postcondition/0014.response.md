Output State: **`T` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `T-1` inputs: each input contains two lines, the first line contains two integers `n` and `k`, the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n-1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, `mi * 2` is greater than `k`, and `t` is 0 if `k` is even, 1 if `k` is odd.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `t` which is assigned the value of `k % 2`, meaning it will be 0 if `k` is even and 1 if `k` is odd. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
