Postcondition: **`T` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `T-2` inputs, `n` is at least 2, `k` is at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n-1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, `mi * 2` is more than `k`, and `t` is either 0 (if `k` is even) or 1 (if `k` is odd). The current value of `a[l]` minus `t` minus half of `k` equals 0.**
