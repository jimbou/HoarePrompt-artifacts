Output State: **T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains T-1 inputs: each input contains two lines, the first line contains two integers n and k, the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of n integers, l is an integer between 0 and n-1 (inclusive), r is an integer between 0 and n-1 (inclusive), ans is an integer between 0 and n (inclusive), mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r], k is an integer between 0 and k (inclusive).**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the input state remains unchanged except for the variables in the loop head and body. The loop will continue to execute until the condition `l < r and k > 0` is no longer met. At this point, the values of `l`, `r`, `ans`, `mi`, and `k` will have been updated according to the operations performed in the loop body. The final values of these variables will depend on the initial values of `n`, `k`, and `a`, as well as the number of iterations of the loop.
