Output State: **T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains T-1 inputs: each input contains two lines, the first line contains two integers n and k, where k must initially be greater than mi * 2, the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, n must be greater than 2, a is a list of n integers, l is 1 or 2, r is n-1 or n-2, mi is the minimum of a[1] and a[r] if a[r] is not 0, otherwise mi is the minimum of a[1] and a[n-2], if a[l] - t - k // 2 equals 0, then ans is either 2, 3, 4 or 5, otherwise ans is either 1, 2, 3 or 4, k is greater than 0, t is 0 if k is even, otherwise t is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code executes a break statement, which means we exit the innermost loop or if statement we were directly inside. The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement. All the conditions and values of the variables remain the same as in the initial state, with the additional information that we have exited the innermost loop or if statement.
