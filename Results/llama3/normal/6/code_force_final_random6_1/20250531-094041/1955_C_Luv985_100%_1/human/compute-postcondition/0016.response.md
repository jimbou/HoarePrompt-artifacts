Output State: **`T` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `T-1` inputs: each input contains two lines, the first line contains two integers `n` and `k`, the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n-1`, `ans` is 1, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, `mi * 2` is greater than `k`, and `t` is 0 if `k` is even, 1 if `k` is odd. The current value of `a[l]` minus `t` minus half of `k` equals -1.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `a[l]`, `t`, and `k` has also been updated, as the current value of `a[l]` minus `t` minus half of `k` now equals -1.
