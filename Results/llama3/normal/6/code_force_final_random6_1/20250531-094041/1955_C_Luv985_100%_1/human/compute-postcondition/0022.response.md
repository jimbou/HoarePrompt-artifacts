Output State: **T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains T-1 inputs: each input contains two lines, the first line contains two integers n and k, where k must initially be greater than mi * 2, the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, n must be greater than 1, a is a list of n integers, l is 1, r is n-1, mi is the minimum of a[1] and a[n-2] if a[r] is not 0, otherwise mi is the minimum of a[1] and a[n-2], ans is either 1 or 2, a[l] is a[l] - mi, a[r] is a[r] - mi, k is k - mi * 2.**

The code modifies the values of `a[l]`, `a[r]`, and `k`. The value of `a[l]` is decreased by `mi`, the value of `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`, and the value of `k` is decreased by `mi * 2`. The values of `T`, `stdin`, `n`, `l`, `r`, `mi`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
