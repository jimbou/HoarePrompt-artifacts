Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains T-1 inputs: each input contains two lines, the first line contains two integers n and k, the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.
Code of the loop:
while T:
    T -= 1
    n, k = input().split()
    n = int(n)
    k = int(k)
    a = input().split()
    a = list(map(lambda x: int(x), a))
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    ans = 0
    while l < r and k > 0:
        mi = min(a[l], a[r])
        if mi * 2 <= k:
            a[l] -= mi
            a[r] -= mi
            k -= mi * 2
            if a[l] == 0:
                ans += 1
                l += 1
            if a[r] == 0:
                ans += 1
                r -= 1
        else:
            t = k % 2
            if a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0:
                ans += 1
            break
    if l == r:
        ans += k >= a[l]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains T-1 inputs: each input contains two lines, the first line contains two integers n and k, the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of n integers, l is an integer between 0 and n-1 (inclusive), r is an integer between 0 and n-1 (inclusive), ans is an integer between 0 and n (inclusive) and is equal to the old value of ans plus 1 if k is greater than or equal to the minimum of a[l] and a[r] when l is equal to r, otherwise ans remains unchanged, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r], k is an integer between 0 and k (inclusive), and the value of ans which is the number of times k is greater than or equal to the minimum of a[l] and a[r] when l is equal to r is being printed
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: l is n-1, r is n-1, ans is the number of times k is greater than or equal to the minimum of a[l] and a[r] when l is equal to r, plus one if k is greater than or equal to a[l] and l is equal to r, k is 0, mi is not defined, and the value of ans which is 0 is being printed
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: l is either 0 or n-1, r is either 0 or n-1, ans is either 0, 1 or n, k is 0, n is greater than 1, a is a list of n integers where a[0] and a[n-1] are each decreased by mi if mi * 2 is less than or equal to k and l is equal to r, otherwise a remains unchanged, T is True, and mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r], and ans is printed


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
