Postcondition: ***`l` is either 0, 1, or 2, `r` is either `n-1` or `n-2` and `r` must be greater than `l`, `ans` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` are each decreased by `min(a[l], a[r])` if `min(a[l], a[r]) * 2` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `a` remains unchanged, `T` is True, and the current value of `a[l]` is either `a[1]`, `a[0]`, or `a[2]`. If `a[r]` is 0, then the current value of `a[r]` is `a[n-2]`. If `min(a[l], a[r]) * 2` is greater than `k`, then `ans` is 1 if the current value of `a[l]` is equal to `t` plus `k // 2`, where `t` is 0 if `k` is even and 1 if `k` is odd, otherwise `ans` remains 0. If `a[l]` is 0, then `l` is either 1 or 2. If `a[r]` is 0, then `r` is either `n-2` or `n-3` and `r` is greater than `l`. If `a[l] - t - k // 2` equals 0, `ans` is either 1, 2, or 3. Otherwise, `ans` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
