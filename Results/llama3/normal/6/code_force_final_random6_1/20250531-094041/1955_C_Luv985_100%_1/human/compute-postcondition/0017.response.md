Postcondition: ***T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains T-1 inputs: each input contains two lines, the first line contains two integers n and k, the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, n must be greater than 1, k must be greater than 0, a is a list of n integers, l is 0, r is n-1, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1], mi * 2 is greater than k, and t is 0 if k is even, 1 if k is odd. If a[l] - t - k // 2 equals 0, then ans is 1 and a[l] - t - k // 2 equals -1. Otherwise, ans remains 0.***
