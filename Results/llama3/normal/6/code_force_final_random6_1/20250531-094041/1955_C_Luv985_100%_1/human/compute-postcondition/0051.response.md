Output State: **T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains T-2 inputs: each input contains two lines, the first line contains two integers n and k, the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of n integers, l is 0, r is n-1, ans is 0, mi is not defined, k is an integer between 0 and k (inclusive), and the value of ans which is the number of times k is greater than or equal to the minimum of a[l] and a[r] when l is equal to r is being printed**

Explanation:

The first line decrements T by 1, so T is now an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive).

The second line reads two integers n and k from stdin, and assigns them to the variables n and k, respectively. Since stdin contains T-1 inputs, it now contains T-2 inputs.

The third and fourth lines convert the input strings to integers and assign them to the variables n and k, respectively.

The fifth line reads a list of n integers from stdin and assigns it to the variable a. Since stdin contains T-2 inputs, it now contains T-3 inputs.

The sixth and seventh lines initialize the variables l and r to 0 and n-1, respectively.

The eighth line initializes the variable ans to 0.

The variable mi is not defined in the given code snippet, so it is not included in the output state.

The variable k is an integer between 0 and k (inclusive), which means its value is not changed by the code.

The value of ans, which is the number of times k is greater than or equal to the minimum of a[l] and a[r] when l is equal to r, is being printed, but since the code does not modify ans, its value remains 0.
