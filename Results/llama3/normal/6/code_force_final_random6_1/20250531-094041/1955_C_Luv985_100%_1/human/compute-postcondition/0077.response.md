Output State: **T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains T-2 inputs, n is at least 2, k is at least 1, a is a list of n integers, l is 1, r is at least 2, ans is either 1, 2, or 3, mi is the minimum of a[1] and a[r] after decrementing by mi, and k is greater than 0, t is either 0 or 1.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, so it can now be either 1, 2, or 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
