Postcondition: ***T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains T-2 inputs, n is at least 3, a is a list of n integers where a[l] and a[r] are decreased by mi, k is at least 1 and greater than 0, decreased by 2 times mi, mi is the minimum of the updated a[l] and a[r]. If a[l] is 0, ans is increased by 1 and l is increased by 1.***
