Output State: **T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains T-1 inputs: each input contains two lines, the first line contains two integers n and k, where k must initially be greater than mi * 2, the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, n must be greater than 1, a is a list of n integers, if a[l] is 0, then l is 2, otherwise l is 1, r is n-2, mi is the minimum of a[1] and a[n-2] if a[r] is not 0, otherwise mi is the minimum of a[1] and a[n-2], ans is either 2, 3 or 4, a[l] is a[l] - mi, a[r] is a[r] - mi, k is k - mi * 2.**

The code increments `ans` by 1, making it either 2, 3, or 4. It also decrements `r` by 1, making it `n-2`. The values of `T`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `mi`, and the contents of `stdin` remain unchanged.
