Output State: **T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains T-2 inputs, n is at least 3, a is a list of n integers where a[l] and a[r] are decreased by mi, k is at least 1 and greater than 0, decreased by 2 times mi, mi is the minimum of the updated a[l] and a[r].**

In this output state, the value of T remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The number of inputs in stdin also remains the same, T-2. The value of n remains at least 3, as it is not modified by the code. The list a still contains n integers, but the values at indices l and r are decreased by mi. The value of k is decreased by 2 times mi, but it is still at least 1 and greater than 0. The value of mi is updated to be the minimum of the updated values of a[l] and a[r].
