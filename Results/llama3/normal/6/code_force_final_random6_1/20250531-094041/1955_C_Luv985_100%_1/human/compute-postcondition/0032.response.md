The variables in the loop head are `l`, `r`, and `k`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l`, `r`, and `k`. If `l` is less than `r` and `k` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 1 or 2, `r` is `n-1` or `n-2`, and `k` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be less than `r` and `k` must be greater than 0. Since `l` is 1 or 2, and `r` is `n-1` or `n-2`, `n` must be greater than 2. Also, since `k` is greater than 0, `k` must be greater than 0.

State: **`T` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `T-1` inputs: each input contains two lines, the first line contains two integers `n` and `k`, where `k` must initially be greater than `mi * 2`, the second line contains `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n`, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is 1 or 2, `r` is `n-1` or `n-2`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[1]` and `a[n-2]` if `a[r]` is not 0, otherwise `mi` is the minimum of `a[1]` and `a[n-2]`, `ans` is either 1, 2, 3 or 4, `k` is greater than 0**
