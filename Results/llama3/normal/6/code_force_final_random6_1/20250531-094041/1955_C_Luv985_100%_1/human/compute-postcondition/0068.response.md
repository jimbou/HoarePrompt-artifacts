Postcondition: ***T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains T-2 inputs, n is at least 2, k is at least 1, a is a list of n integers, l is 0, r is n-1, ans is 0, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1]. If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, a[l] and a[r] are decremented by mi. If a[l] is 0, l is 1, r is n-1, ans is 1, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1] after decrementing by mi, and k is reduced by mi * 2. The current value of a[l] is a[1]. If a[r] is 0, l is 1, r is n-2, ans is 2, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1] after decrementing by mi, and k is reduced by mi * 2. The current value of a[l] is a[1]. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If mi * 2 is more than k, then t is either 0 (if k is even) or 1 (if k is odd). If a[l] - t - k // 2 equals 0, then ans is 1. Otherwise, ans remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
