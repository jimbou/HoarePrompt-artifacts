Output State: **`T` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `T-2` inputs, `n` must be at least 2, `k` must be at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n-1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `mi` is determined by the minimum of the first and last elements of the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial conditions.
