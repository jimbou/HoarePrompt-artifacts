To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `l`, `r`, and `k` since these are the variables in the loop head.

1. **`l` and `r`**: For the loop to continue, `l` must be less than `r`. Given that `l` is 1 and `r` is `n-1` after the previous iteration (when `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`), we don't need to adjust these values because they already satisfy the condition for the loop to execute again.

2. **`k`**: The loop also requires `k` to be greater than 0. After the previous iteration, if `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`, `k` is updated to `k - mi * 2`. However, we need to ensure that after this subtraction, `k` is still greater than 0 for the loop to execute again. Therefore, the initial value of `k` must be greater than `mi * 2` to ensure that after the subtraction, `k` remains greater than 0.

Given these considerations, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

- `T` remains an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive).
- `stdin` contains `T-1` inputs, with each input containing two lines as described.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `k` must initially be greater than `mi * 2` to ensure it remains greater than 0 after the subtraction.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers.
- `l` is 1.
- `r` is `n-1`.
- `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`.
- `ans` is either 1 or 2, depending on the previous iteration's conditions.
- The current value of `a[l]` is `a[1]` if `a[r]` is not 0, otherwise the current value of `a[r]` is `a[n-2]`.

State: **`T` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `T-1` inputs: each input contains two lines, the first line contains two integers `n` and `k`, where `k` must initially be greater than `mi * 2`, the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is 1, `r` is `n-1`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, `ans` is either 1 or 2, the current value of `a[l]` is `a[1]` if `a[r]` is not 0, otherwise the current value of `a[r]` is `a[n-2]`.**
