Output State: **T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains T-1 inputs: each input contains two lines, the first line contains two integers n and k, where k must initially be greater than mi * 2, the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, n must be greater than 2, a is a list of n integers, l is 1 or 2, r is n-1 or n-2, mi is the minimum of a[1] and a[r] if a[r] is not 0, otherwise mi is the minimum of a[1] and a[n-2], ans is either 1, 2, 3 or 4, k is greater than 0, a[l] is reduced by mi, a[r] is reduced by mi, k is reduced by mi * 2**
