Output State: **T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains T-2 inputs, n is at least 3, k is at least 1 and greater than 0, a is a list of n integers, r is at least 3, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r].**

In this output state, the value of `mi` is determined by taking the minimum of the values at indices `l` and `r` in the list `a`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains T-2 inputs, and the ranges of the variables T, n, k, and r are still valid.
