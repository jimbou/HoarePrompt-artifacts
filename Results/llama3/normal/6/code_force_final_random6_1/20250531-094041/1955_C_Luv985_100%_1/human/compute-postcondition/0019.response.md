Postcondition: **T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains T-1 inputs: each input contains two lines, the first line contains two integers n and k, the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, n must be greater than 1, k must be greater than 0, a is a list of n integers, l is 0, r is n-1, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1], ans is 0. If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, then if a[0] - mi is 0, l is 1, r is n-1, ans is 2 if a[r] is 0, otherwise ans is 1, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1], a[0] is a[0] - mi, a[n-1] is a[n-1] - mi, k is k - mi * 2, the current value of a[l] is a[1] if a[r] is not 0, otherwise the current value of a[r] is a[n-2]. Otherwise, no changes are made to l, r, ans, mi, a[0], a[n-1], k. If mi * 2 is greater than k, then if a[l] - t - k // 2 equals 0, ans is 1 and a[l] - t - k // 2 equals -1. Otherwise, ans remains 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
