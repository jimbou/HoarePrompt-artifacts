Output State: **T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains T-1 inputs: each input contains two lines, the first line contains two integers n and k, the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, n must be greater than 1, k must be greater than 0, a is a list of n integers, l is 0, r is n-1, ans is 0, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1], a[0] is a[0] - mi, a[n-1] is a[n-1] - mi, k is k - mi * 2.**

In this output state, the value of `T` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The `stdin` still contains `T-1` inputs, each with two lines, but the values of `n`, `k`, and `a` are not affected by the code. The list `a` still contains `n` integers, but the values of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` are decremented by `mi`. The value of `l` remains 0, and the value of `r` remains `n-1`. The value of `ans` remains 0 as it is not modified by the code. The value of `mi` remains the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, but since `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` are decremented by `mi`, the value of `mi` is effectively reduced by `mi`. The value of `k` is decremented by `mi * 2`.
