Postcondition: **l is either 0 or n-1, r is either 0 or n-1, and the current value of l is equal to the current value of r, ans is either 0 or n, k is 0, n is greater than 1, a is a list of n integers where a[0] and a[n-1] are each decreased by min(a[l], a[r]) if min(a[l], a[r]) * 2 is less than or equal to k, otherwise a remains unchanged, T is True, and mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r].**
