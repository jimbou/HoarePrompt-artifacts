Postcondition: ***T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains T-1 inputs: each input contains two lines, the first line contains two integers n and k, where k must initially be greater than mi * 2, the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, n must be greater than 1, a is a list of n integers, l is 1, r is n-1, mi is the minimum of a[1] and a[n-2] if a[r] is not 0, otherwise mi is the minimum of a[1] and a[n-2], ans is either 1, 2, 3 or 4. If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, then if a[l] is 0, l is 2, otherwise l is 1, r is n-1 if a[r] is not 0, otherwise r is n-2, a[l] is a[l] - mi, a[r] is a[r] - mi, k is k - mi * 2. Otherwise, if a[l] - t - k // 2 equals 0, then ans is either 2 or 3, t is either 0 or 1. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of ans and t, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
