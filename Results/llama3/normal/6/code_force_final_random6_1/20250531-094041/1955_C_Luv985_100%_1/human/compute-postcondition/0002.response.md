Output State: **T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains T-1 inputs: each input contains two lines, the first line contains two integers n and k, the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of n integers, l is 0, r is n-1, ans is 0**

In this output state, the value of T has been decremented by 1. The stdin still contains T-1 inputs, each consisting of two lines. The first line of each input contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. The variables n and k have been assigned the values of the first two integers from the first input in stdin. The variable a is a list of n integers, which are the integers from the second line of the first input in stdin. The variables l and r have been initialized to 0 and n-1, respectively. The variable ans has been initialized to 0.
