Postcondition: ***T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains T-2 inputs, n is at least 3, k is at least 1 and greater than 0, a is a list of n integers, r is at least 3, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r], t is 0 if k is even and 1 if k is odd. If a[l] - t - k // 2 equals 0, ans is increased by 1.***
