Postcondition: ***`l` is either 0 or 1, `r` is either `n-1` or `n-2`, `ans` is either 0, 1, or 2, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` are each decreased by `mi` if `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `a` remains unchanged, `T` is True, and the current value of `a[l]` is either `a[1]` or `a[0]`. If `a[r]` is 0, then the current value of `a[r]` is `a[n-2]`. If `mi * 2` is greater than `k`, then `ans` is 1 if the current value of `a[l]` is equal to `t` plus `k // 2`, where `t` is 0 if `k` is even and 1 if `k` is odd, otherwise `ans` remains 0.***
