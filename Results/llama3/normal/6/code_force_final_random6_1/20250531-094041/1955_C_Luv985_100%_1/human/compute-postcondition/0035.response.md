Output State: **T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains T-1 inputs: each input contains two lines, the first line contains two integers n and k, where k must initially be greater than mi * 2, the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, n must be greater than 2, a is a list of n integers, l is 2 or 3, r is n-1 or n-2, mi is the minimum of a[1] and a[r] if a[r] is not 0, otherwise mi is the minimum of a[1] and a[n-2], ans is either 2, 3, 4 or 5, k is greater than 0, a[l] is reduced by mi, a[r] is reduced by mi, k is reduced by mi * 2**

The code increments the value of `ans` by 1, making it either 2, 3, 4, or 5. It also increments the value of `l` by 1, making it either 2 or 3. The values of `T`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `r`, `mi`, and the contents of stdin remain unchanged.
