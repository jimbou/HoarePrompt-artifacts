Output State: **`T` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `T-2` inputs, `n` must be at least 2, `k` must be at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n-1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, `mi * 2` is more than `k`, and `t` is either 0 (if `k` is even) or 1 (if `k` is odd).**

In this output state, the value of `t` is determined by the remainder of `k` divided by 2, which means `t` will be 0 if `k` is even and 1 if `k` is odd. The other variables remain unchanged.
