Output State: **`l` is either 0 or 1, `r` is either `n-1` or `n-2` and `r` must be greater than `l`, `ans` is either 0, 1, or 2, `k` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` are each decreased by `min(a[l], a[r])` if `min(a[l], a[r]) * 2` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `a` remains unchanged, `T` is True, and the current value of `a[l]` is either `a[1]` or `a[0]`. If `a[r]` is 0, then the current value of `a[r]` is `a[n-2]`. If `min(a[l], a[r]) * 2` is greater than `k`, then `ans` is 1 if the current value of `a[l]` is equal to `t` plus `k // 2`, where `t` is 0 if `k` is even and 1 if `k` is odd, otherwise `ans` remains 0, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `l`, `r`, `ans`, `k`, `n`, and `T` remain the same as in the initial state. The list `a` may have its first and last elements decreased by the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]` if this minimum is less than or equal to half of `k`. The current value of `a[l]` is either `a[1]` or `a[0]`, and if `a[r]` is 0, it is `a[n-2]`. The value of `ans` may change to 1 if the current value of `a[l]` is equal to `t` plus `k // 2`, where `t` is 0 if `k` is even and 1 if `k` is odd. The variable `mi` is assigned the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`.
