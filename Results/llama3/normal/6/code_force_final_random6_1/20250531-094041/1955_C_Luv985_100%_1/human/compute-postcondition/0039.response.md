Output State: **`T` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `T-1` inputs: each input contains two lines, the first line contains two integers `n` and `k`, where `k` must initially be greater than `mi * 2`, the second line contains `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n`, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is 1 or 2, `r` is `n-1` or `n-2`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[1]` and `a[r]` if `a[r]` is not 0, otherwise `mi` is the minimum of `a[1]` and `a[n-2]`, `ans` is either 1, 2, 3 or 4, `k` is greater than 0, `t` is 0 if `k` is even, otherwise `t` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `t` is determined by the remainder of `k` divided by 2. If `k` is even, `t` is 0; otherwise, `t` is 1. The other variables remain unchanged, and the input state remains the same.
