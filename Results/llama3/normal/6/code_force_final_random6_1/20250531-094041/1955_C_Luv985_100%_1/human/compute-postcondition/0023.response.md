Output State: **T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains T-1 inputs: each input contains two lines, the first line contains two integers n and k, where k must initially be greater than mi * 2, the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, n must be greater than 1, a is a list of n integers, l is 2, r is n-1, mi is the minimum of a[1] and a[n-2] if a[r] is not 0, otherwise mi is the minimum of a[1] and a[n-2], ans is either 2 or 3, a[l] is a[l] - mi, a[r] is a[r] - mi, k is k - mi * 2.**

The code increments the value of `ans` by 1, making it either 2 or 3. It also increments the value of `l` by 1, making it 2. The value of `r` remains unchanged at n-1. The value of `mi` is still the minimum of `a[1]` and `a[n-2]` if `a[r]` is not 0, otherwise it is the minimum of `a[1]` and `a[n-2]`. The values of `a[l]` and `a[r]` are updated by subtracting `mi` from them. The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `mi * 2` from it. The values of `T`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.
