To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the loop condition, which is simply `while T:`. This means the loop will execute as long as `T` is not zero.

Given that `T` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), we can see that `T` is already in a state that allows the loop to execute at least once because it is guaranteed to be greater than zero.

Therefore, no adjustments to the state of `T` or any other variables are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **T is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains T-1 inputs: each input contains two lines, the first line contains two integers n and k, the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.**
