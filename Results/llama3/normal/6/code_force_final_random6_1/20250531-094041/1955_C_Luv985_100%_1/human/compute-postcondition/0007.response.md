Postcondition: **T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains T-1 inputs: each input contains two lines, the first line contains two integers n and k, the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, n must be greater than 1, k must be greater than 0, a is a list of n integers, l is 0, r is n-1, ans is 0, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1], a[0] is a[0] - mi, a[n-1] is a[n-1] - mi, k is k - mi * 2. The current value of a[l] is 0.**
