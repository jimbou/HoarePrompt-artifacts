Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains T-1 inputs: each input contains two lines, the first line contains two integers n and k, the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of n integers, l is 0, r is n-1, ans is 0
Code of the loop:
while l < r and k > 0:
    mi = min(a[l], a[r])
    if mi * 2 <= k:
        a[l] -= mi
        a[r] -= mi
        k -= mi * 2
        if a[l] == 0:
            ans += 1
            l += 1
        if a[r] == 0:
            ans += 1
            r -= 1
    else:
        t = k % 2
        if a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0:
            ans += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains T-1 inputs: each input contains two lines, the first line contains two integers n and k, the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, n must be greater than 1, k must be greater than 0, a is a list of n integers, l is 0, r is n-1, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1], ans is 0. If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, then if a[0] - mi is 0, l is 1, r is n-1, ans is 2 if a[r] is 0, otherwise ans is 1, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1], a[0] is a[0] - mi, a[n-1] is a[n-1] - mi, k is k - mi * 2, the current value of a[l] is a[1] if a[r] is not 0, otherwise the current value of a[r] is a[n-2]. Otherwise, no changes are made to l, r, ans, mi, a[0], a[n-1], k. If mi * 2 is greater than k, then if a[l] - t - k // 2 equals 0, ans is 1 and a[l] - t - k // 2 equals -1. Otherwise, ans remains 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains T-1 inputs: each input contains two lines, the first line contains two integers n and k, where k must initially be greater than mi * 2, the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, n must be greater than 1, a is a list of n integers, l is 1, r is n-1, mi is the minimum of a[1] and a[n-2] if a[r] is not 0, otherwise mi is the minimum of a[1] and a[n-2], ans is either 1, 2, 3 or 4. If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, then if a[l] is 0, l is 2, otherwise l is 1, r is n-1 if a[r] is not 0, otherwise r is n-2, a[l] is a[l] - mi, a[r] is a[r] - mi, k is k - mi * 2. Otherwise, if a[l] - t - k // 2 equals 0, then ans is either 2 or 3, t is either 0 or 1. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of ans and t, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains T-1 inputs: each input contains two lines, the first line contains two integers n and k, where k must initially be greater than mi * 2, the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, n must be greater than 2, a is a list of n integers, l is 1 or 2, r is n-1 or n-2, mi is the minimum of a[1] and a[r] if a[r] is not 0, otherwise mi is the minimum of a[1] and a[n-2], ans is either 1, 2, 3 or 4, k is greater than 0. If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, then a[l] is reduced by mi, a[r] is reduced by mi, k is reduced by mi * 2. If a[r] is 0, then l is 1 or 2, r is n-2 or n-3, mi is the minimum of a[1] and a[r] if a[r] is not 0, otherwise mi is the minimum of a[1] and a[n-3], ans is either 2, 3, 4 or 5, k is greater than 0, a[l] is reduced by mi, a[r] is reduced by mi, k is reduced by mi * 2. If a[l] is 0, then l is 2 or 3, r is n-1 or n-2, ans is either 2, 3, 4 or 5. If a[l] is 0 and a[r] is 0, then l is 2 or 3, r is n-2 or n-3, ans is either 3, 4, 5 or 6. Otherwise, if a[l] - t - k // 2 equals 0, then ans is either 2, 3, 4 or 5, otherwise ans is either 1, 2, 3 or 4, k is greater than 0, t is 0 if k is even, otherwise t is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
