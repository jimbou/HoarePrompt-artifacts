Output State: **T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains T-1 inputs: each input contains two lines, the first line contains two integers n and k, the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of n integers, l is an integer between 0 and n-1 (inclusive), r is an integer between 0 and n-1 (inclusive), ans is an integer between 0 and n (inclusive) and is equal to the old value of ans plus 1 if k is greater than or equal to the minimum of a[l] and a[r], mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r], k is an integer between 0 and k (inclusive), and the current values of l and r are equal.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of T remains the same. The stdin still contains T-1 inputs, each containing two lines of integers. The values of n, k, a, l, r, and mi also remain unchanged. However, the value of ans has been incremented by 1 if k is greater than or equal to the minimum of a[l] and a[r], which are equal since l and r have the same value.
