Postcondition: **l is either 0, 1, or 2, r is either n-1 or n-2 and r must be greater than l, ans is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, k is greater than or equal to 0, n is greater than 1, a is a list of n integers where a[0] and a[n-1] are each decreased by min(a[l], a[r]) if min(a[l], a[r]) * 2 is less than or equal to k, otherwise a remains unchanged, T is True, and the current value of a[l] is either a[1], a[0], or a[2]. If a[r] is 0, then the current value of a[r] is a[n-2]. If min(a[l], a[r]) * 2 is greater than k, then ans is 1 if the current value of a[l] is equal to t plus k // 2, where t is 0 if k is even and 1 if k is odd, otherwise ans remains 0, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r]. If a[l] is 0, then l is either 1 or 2.**
