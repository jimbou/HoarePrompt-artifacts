Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains T-2 inputs: each input contains two lines, the first line contains two integers n and k, the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of n integers, l is 0, r is n-1, ans is 0, mi is not defined, k is an integer between 0 and k (inclusive), and the value of ans which is the number of times k is greater than or equal to the minimum of a[l] and a[r] when l is equal to r is being printed
Code of the loop:
while l < r and k > 0:
    mi = min(a[l], a[r])
    if mi * 2 <= k:
        a[l] -= mi
        a[r] -= mi
        k -= mi * 2
        if a[l] == 0:
            ans += 1
            l += 1
        if a[r] == 0:
            ans += 1
            r -= 1
    else:
        t = k % 2
        if a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0:
            ans += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains T-2 inputs, n is at least 2, k is at least 1, a is a list of n integers, l is 0, r is n-1, ans is 0, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1]. If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, a[l] and a[r] are decremented by mi. If a[l] is 0, l is 1, r is n-1, ans is 1, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1] after decrementing by mi, and k is reduced by mi * 2. The current value of a[l] is a[1]. If a[r] is 0, l is 1, r is n-2, ans is 2, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1] after decrementing by mi, and k is reduced by mi * 2. The current value of a[l] is a[1]. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If mi * 2 is more than k, then t is either 0 (if k is even) or 1 (if k is odd). If a[l] - t - k // 2 equals 0, then ans is 1. Otherwise, ans remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains T-2 inputs, n is at least 2, k is at least 1 and greater than 0, a is a list of n integers. If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, then a[l] and a[r] are decremented by mi. If a[r] is 0, then if a[l] is 0, l is 2, ans is either 2, 3, or 4, mi is the minimum of a[1] and a[r] after decrementing by mi, and k is reduced by mi * 2, r is reduced by 1. Otherwise, l is 1, ans is either 1, 2, or 3, mi is the minimum of a[1] and a[r] after decrementing by mi, and k is reduced by mi * 2, r is reduced by 1. If a[r] is not 0, then if a[l] is 0, l is 2, ans is either 1, 2, or 3, mi is the minimum of a[1] and a[r] after decrementing by mi, and k is reduced by mi * 2. Otherwise, l is 1, ans is either 0, 1, or 2, mi is the minimum of a[1] and a[r] after decrementing by mi, and k is reduced by mi * 2. If mi * 2 is greater than k, then if a[l] - t - k // 2 equals 0, then ans is either 1, 2, or 3. Otherwise, ans remains either 0, 1, or 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains T-2 inputs, n is at least 3, k is at least 1 and greater than 0, a is a list of n integers. If the minimum of a[l] and a[r] (mi) times 2 is less than or equal to k, then a[l] and a[r] are decreased by mi, k is decreased by 2 times mi, and mi is updated to the minimum of the updated a[l] and a[r]. If a[l] is 0, ans is increased by 1 and l is increased by 1. If a[r] is 0, ans is increased by 1 and r is decreased by 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If mi times 2 is greater than k, then if a[l] - t - k // 2 equals 0, where t is 0 if k is even and 1 if k is odd, ans is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
