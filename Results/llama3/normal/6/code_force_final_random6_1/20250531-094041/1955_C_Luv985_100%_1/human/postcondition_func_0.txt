This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers (n and k) and a list of n integers (a_1 to a_n). It then calculates the number of times k is greater than or equal to the minimum of a[l] and a[r] when l is equal to r, and prints this value for each test case. The function continues to read and process test cases until the input is exhausted.
