Output State: **`T` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `T-1` inputs: each input contains two lines, the first line contains two integers `n` and `k`, where `k` must initially be greater than `mi * 2`, the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is 1, `r` is `n-1`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[1]` and `a[n-2]` if `a[r]` is not 0, otherwise `mi` is the minimum of `a[1]` and `a[n-2]`. If `a[l] - t - k // 2` equals 0, then `ans` is either 2 or 3, `t` is either 0 or 1. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of `ans` and `t`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `T`, `stdin`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `mi`, `ans`, and `t` remain the same as in the initial state.
