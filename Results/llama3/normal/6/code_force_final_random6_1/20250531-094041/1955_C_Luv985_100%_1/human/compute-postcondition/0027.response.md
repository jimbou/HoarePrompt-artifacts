Output State: **`T` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `T-1` inputs: each input contains two lines, the first line contains two integers `n` and `k`, where `k` must initially be greater than `mi * 2`, the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is 1, `r` is `n-1`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[1]` and `a[n-2]` if `a[r]` is not 0, otherwise `mi` is the minimum of `a[1]` and `a[n-2]`, `ans` is either 1 or 2, `t` is either 0 or 1.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is either 0 or 1, which is the remainder of `k` divided by 2. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
