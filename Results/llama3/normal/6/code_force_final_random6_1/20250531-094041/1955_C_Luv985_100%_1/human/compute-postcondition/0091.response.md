Output State: **T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains T-2 inputs, n is at least 3, k is at least 1 and greater than 0, a is a list of n integers, r is at least 3, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r], t is 0 if k is even and 1 if k is odd. If a[l] - t - k // 2 equals 0, ans is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables T, n, k, a, r, mi, and t remain the same, and the condition for increasing ans is still valid. The only change is that we exit the loop or if statement.
