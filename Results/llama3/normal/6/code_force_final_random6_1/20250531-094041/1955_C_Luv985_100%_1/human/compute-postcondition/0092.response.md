Postcondition: ***T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains T-2 inputs, n is at least 3, k is at least 1 and greater than 0, a is a list of n integers. If the minimum of a[l] and a[r] (mi) times 2 is less than or equal to k, then a[l] and a[r] are decreased by mi, k is decreased by 2 times mi, and mi is updated to the minimum of the updated a[l] and a[r]. If a[l] is 0, ans is increased by 1 and l is increased by 1. If a[r] is 0, ans is increased by 1 and r is decreased by 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If mi times 2 is greater than k, then if a[l] - t - k // 2 equals 0, where t is 0 if k is even and 1 if k is odd, ans is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
