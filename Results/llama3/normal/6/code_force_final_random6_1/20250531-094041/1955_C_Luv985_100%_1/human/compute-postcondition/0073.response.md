Postcondition: **T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains T-2 inputs, n is at least 2, k is at least 1 and greater than 0, a is a list of n integers where a[l] and a[r] are decremented by mi. If a[l] is 0, then l is 2, ans is either 1, 2, or 3, mi is the minimum of a[1] and a[r] after decrementing by mi, and k is reduced by mi * 2. Otherwise, l is 1, ans is either 0, 1, or 2, mi is the minimum of a[1] and a[r] after decrementing by mi, and k is reduced by mi * 2.**
