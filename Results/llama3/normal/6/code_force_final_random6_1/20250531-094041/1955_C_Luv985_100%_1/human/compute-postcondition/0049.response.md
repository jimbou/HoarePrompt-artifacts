Output: **T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains T-1 inputs: each input contains two lines, the first line contains two integers n and k, the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of n integers, l is an integer between 0 and n-1 (inclusive), r is an integer between 0 and n-1 (inclusive), ans is an integer between 0 and n (inclusive) and is equal to the old value of ans plus 1 if k is greater than or equal to the minimum of a[l] and a[r] when l is equal to r, otherwise ans remains unchanged, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r], k is an integer between 0 and k (inclusive), and the value of ans which is the number of times k is greater than or equal to the minimum of a[l] and a[r] when l is equal to r is being printed**
