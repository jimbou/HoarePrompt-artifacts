Output State: **T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains T-1 inputs: each input contains two lines, the first line contains two integers n and k, where k must initially be greater than mi * 2, the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, n must be greater than 2, a is a list of n integers, l is 1 or 2, r is n-2 or n-3, mi is the minimum of a[1] and a[r] if a[r] is not 0, otherwise mi is the minimum of a[1] and a[n-3], ans is either 2, 3, 4 or 5, k is greater than 0, a[l] is reduced by mi, a[r] is reduced by mi, k is reduced by mi * 2. If a[l] is 0, then l is 2 or 3, r is n-2 or n-3, ans is either 3, 4, 5 or 6.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `r` has been decremented by 1. The values of `T`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, and `mi` remain unchanged. The relationship between `k` and `mi` remains the same, with `k` being greater than `mi * 2`. The list `a` still contains `n` integers, and the values of `l` and `r` are still within their respective ranges. The value of `ans` has been updated to reflect the increment operation.
