Output State: **T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains T-2 inputs, n is at least 3, k is at least 1 and greater than 0, a is a list of n integers, r is at least 3, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r], t is 0 if k is even and 1 if k is odd.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is determined by the remainder of `k` divided by 2. If `k` is even, `t` is 0; if `k` is odd, `t` is 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
