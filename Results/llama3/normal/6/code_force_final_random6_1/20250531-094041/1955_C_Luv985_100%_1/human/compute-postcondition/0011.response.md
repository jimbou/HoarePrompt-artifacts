Output State: **T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains T-1 inputs: each input contains two lines, the first line contains two integers n and k, the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, n must be greater than 1, k must be greater than 0, a is a list of n integers, if a[0] - mi is 0, then l is 1, r is n-1, ans is 2, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1], a[0] is a[0] - mi, a[n-1] is a[n-1] - mi, k is k - mi * 2, the current value of a[l] is a[1]. Otherwise, no changes are made to l, r, ans, mi, a[0], a[n-1], k. The current value of a[r] is a[n-2].**

In this final state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `r` has been decremented by 1. The value of `a[r]` has changed to `a[n-2]` because `r` now points to the second last element of the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
