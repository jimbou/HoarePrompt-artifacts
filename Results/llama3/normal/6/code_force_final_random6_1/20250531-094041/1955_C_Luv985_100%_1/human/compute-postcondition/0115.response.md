Postcondition: ***`l` is 0, `r` is `n-1`, `k` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `T` is True, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, `mi * 2` is greater than `k`, and `t` is 0 if `k` is even, 1 if `k` is odd. If the current value of `a[l]` is equal to `t` plus `k // 2`, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.***
