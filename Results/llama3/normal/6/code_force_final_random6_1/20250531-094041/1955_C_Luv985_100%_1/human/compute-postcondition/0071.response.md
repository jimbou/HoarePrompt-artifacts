Output State: **T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains T-2 inputs, n is at least 2, k is at least 1 and greater than 0, a is a list of n integers where a[l] and a[r] are decremented by mi, l is 1, r is at least 2, ans is either 0, 1, or 2, mi is the minimum of a[1] and a[r] after decrementing by mi, and k is reduced by mi * 2.**

In this output state, the values of T, n, l, r, and ans remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of k is reduced by mi * 2, but it is still greater than 0. The list a is modified, with a[l] and a[r] decremented by mi. The value of mi is updated to be the minimum of a[1] and a[r] after decrementing by mi. Stdin remains unchanged, containing T-2 inputs.
