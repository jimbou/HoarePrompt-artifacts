Output State: **T is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains T-2 inputs, n is at least 2, k is at least 1 and greater than 0, a is a list of n integers where a[l] and a[r] are decremented by mi, l is 2, r is at least 2, ans is either 1, 2, or 3, mi is the minimum of a[1] and a[r] after decrementing by mi, and k is reduced by mi * 2.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `l` has been incremented by 1. The values of `T`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `r`, and `mi` remain unchanged. The state of `stdin` also remains the same, containing `T-2` inputs.
