Postcondition: ***`x` is a list of two integers where the first integer is greater than 0 and the second integer is greater than 1, `i` is 1, if `x` is divisible by `i`, `output1` is a list containing 1 and `output2` is a list containing the integer division of `x` by 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
