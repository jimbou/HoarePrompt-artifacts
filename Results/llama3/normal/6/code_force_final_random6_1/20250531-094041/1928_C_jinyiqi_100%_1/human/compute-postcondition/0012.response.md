Output State: **x is a list of two integers where the first integer is greater than or equal to the second integer and the second integer is greater than 1, output1 is a list containing all the divisors of the first integer of x that are less than or equal to the square root of the first integer of x in reverse order, output2 is a list containing the integer division of the first integer of x by each of the divisors in output1.**

The code reverses the order of the list output1, which contains the divisors of the first integer of x that are less than or equal to the square root of the first integer of x. The values of x and output2 remain unchanged.
