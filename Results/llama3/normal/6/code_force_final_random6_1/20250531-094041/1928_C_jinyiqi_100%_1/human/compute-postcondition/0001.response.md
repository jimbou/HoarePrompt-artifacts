To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` is greater than 1. This means `x ** 0.5` must be greater than 0, which implies that `x` must be greater than 0.

Since `x` is a list of two integers, we need to ensure that the list has at least one element, and the first element is greater than 0.

The state of `output1` and `output2` does not affect the execution of the loop, so we don't need to adjust them.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`x` is a list of two integers where the first integer is greater than 0 and the second integer is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `output1` is an empty list, `output2` is an empty list**
