Output State: **x is a list of two integers where the first integer is greater than 0 and the second integer is greater than 1, i is 1, output1 is a list containing 1, output2 is a list containing the integer division of x by 1.**

The code first appends the value of `i` to `output1`, making `output1` a list containing 1. Then, it appends the integer division of `x` by `i` to `output2`. Since `i` is 1, the integer division of `x` by `i` is simply `x` itself. Therefore, `output2` becomes a list containing the original value of `x`. The values of `x` and `i` remain unchanged.
