To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to continue executing.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):`. This means that the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5)`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.

The state of `x` does not change, as it is not modified in the loop head. The state of `output1` and `output2` also does not change, as they are not modified in the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`x` is a list of two integers where the first integer is greater than 0 and the second integer is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `output1` is a list containing 1, `output2` is a list containing the integer division of `x` by 1**

Note that the state of `output1` and `output2` is still the same as the previous iteration, as they are not modified in the loop head.
