Postcondition: ***`x` is a list of two integers where the first integer is greater than 0 and the second integer is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `output1` is a list containing 1 and 2 if `x` is divisible by 2, otherwise it is a list containing 1, `output2` is a list containing the integer division of `x` by 1 and the integer division of `x` by 2 if `x` is divisible by 2, otherwise it is a list containing the integer division of `x` by 1.***
