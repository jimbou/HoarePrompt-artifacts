This function takes a list of two integers as input, where the first integer is greater than or equal to the second integer and the second integer is greater than 1. It returns a combined list of divisors of the first integer, where the divisors are paired with their corresponding integer divisions. The list is ordered such that the divisors less than or equal to the square root of the first integer are in reverse order, followed by their corresponding integer divisions.
