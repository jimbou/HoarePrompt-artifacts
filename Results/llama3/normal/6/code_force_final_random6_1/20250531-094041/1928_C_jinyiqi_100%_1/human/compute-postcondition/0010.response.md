Postcondition: ***`x` is a list of two integers where the first integer is greater than or equal to 4 and the second integer is greater than 1, `i` is 3. If `x` is divisible by 3, `output1` is a list containing 1, 2, and 3. Otherwise, `output1` is a list containing 1 and 3. `output2` is a list containing the integer division of `x` by 1, the integer division of `x` by 2, and the integer division of `x` by 3 if `x` is divisible by 3. Otherwise, `output2` is a list containing the integer division of `x` by 1.***
