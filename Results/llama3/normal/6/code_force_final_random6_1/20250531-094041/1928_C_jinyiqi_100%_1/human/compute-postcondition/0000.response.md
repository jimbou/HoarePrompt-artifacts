Output State: **x is a list of two integers, the first integer is greater than or equal to the second integer, and the second integer is greater than 1, output1 is an empty list, output2 is an empty list.**

The code initializes two empty lists, output1 and output2, but does not modify the list x. Therefore, the state of x remains unchanged, and the output state includes the newly created empty lists.
