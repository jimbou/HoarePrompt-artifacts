#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a list of two integers, the first integer is greater than or equal to the second integer, and the second integer is greater than 1.
    output1 = []
    output2 = []
    for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            output1.append(i)

    #State: x is a list of two integers where the first integer is greater than or equal to the second integer and the second integer is greater than 1, output1 is a list containing all the divisors of the first integer of x that are less than or equal to the square root of the first integer of x, output2 is a list containing the integer division of the first integer of x by each of the divisors in output1.
    output1.reverse()
    return output2 + output1
    #The program returns a combined list of output2 and output1. output2 is a list containing the integer division of the first integer of x by each of the divisors in output1, where the first integer of x is greater than or equal to the second integer of x and the second integer of x is greater than 1. output1 is a list containing all the divisors of the first integer of x that are less than or equal to the square root of the first integer of x in reverse order.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of two integers as input, where the first integer is greater than or equal to the second integer and the second integer is greater than 1. It returns a combined list of divisors of the first integer, where the divisors are paired with their corresponding integer divisions. The list is ordered such that the divisors less than or equal to the square root of the first integer are in reverse order, followed by their corresponding integer divisions.
