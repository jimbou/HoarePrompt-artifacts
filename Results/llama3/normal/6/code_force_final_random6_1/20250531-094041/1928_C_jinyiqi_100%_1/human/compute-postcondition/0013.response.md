Output State: **The program returns a combined list of output2 and output1. output2 is a list containing the integer division of the first integer of x by each of the divisors in output1, where the first integer of x is greater than or equal to the second integer of x and the second integer of x is greater than 1. output1 is a list containing all the divisors of the first integer of x that are less than or equal to the square root of the first integer of x in reverse order.**
