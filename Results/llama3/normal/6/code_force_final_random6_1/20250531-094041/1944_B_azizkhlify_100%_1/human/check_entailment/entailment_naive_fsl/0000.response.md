Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when the input is:

6 2
5 1 3 3 5 1 2 6 4 6 4 2

The program outputs:

5 1 3 3
6 4 2 4

However, the correct output should be:

5 1 3 3
6 4 2 4

The issue is that the program does not correctly handle the case when there are multiple pairs of identical numbers in the first half of the array. In this case, the program prints the same pair twice, which is not a valid solution.

The program should be modified to correctly handle this case, for example by keeping track of the numbers that have already been printed and avoiding printing the same pair twice.
