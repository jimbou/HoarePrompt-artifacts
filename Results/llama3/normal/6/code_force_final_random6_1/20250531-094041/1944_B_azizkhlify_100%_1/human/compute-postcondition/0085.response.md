Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `k` is an integer equal to 4 * k - ul if ul is less than or equal to n * 2, otherwise k is an integer equal to 2 * k - n * 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 0 for all `i` in range(`n`) and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is either 0 or 2 for all `i` in range(`n`), if `k` is non-zero, then `re` is equal to `k` and `res` is a list containing all elements from `a` where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, otherwise, `re` and `res` remain unchanged, `i` is equal to the last element in `res`, nothing is printed, and `res` is empty, and all elements in `res` have been printed, and the current value of `ul` is not equal to `ur`. If `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, then `ur` is equal to `ur + 2`, and the value of `a[i]` which is equal to the last element in `res` is printed twice.**
