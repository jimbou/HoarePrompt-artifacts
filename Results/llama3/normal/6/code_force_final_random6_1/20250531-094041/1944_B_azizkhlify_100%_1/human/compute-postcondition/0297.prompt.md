Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is 2 * `k` - `ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range `n` to `2 * n - 1`. If `k` is true, then `re` is `k`, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is a list containing the first `k` elements of `a` that have a count of 1 in `l`, and `i` is `n`. Otherwise, the values of `re`, `ul`, `ur`, `res`, and `i` remain unchanged. and nothing is printed
Code of the loop:
for i in res:
    print(i, end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is 2 * `k` - `ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range `n` to `2 * n - 1`. If `k` is true, then `re` is `k`, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is a list containing the first `k` elements of `a` that have a count of 1 in `l` and is not empty, and `i` is `n`. Otherwise, the values of `re`, `ul`, `ur`, `res`, and `i` remain unchanged. and nothing is printed, `i` is an element in `res`, and the value of `i` which is an element in `res` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is 2 * `k` - `ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range `n` to `2 * n - 1`. If `k` is true, then `re` is `k`, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is a list containing the first `k` elements of `a` that have a count of 1 in `l` and is not empty, and `i` is `n`. Otherwise, the values of `re`, `ul`, `ur`, `res`, and `i` remain unchanged. and nothing is printed, `i` is an element in `res`, and the value of `i` which is an element in `res` is being printed, `res` is a list containing the first `k` elements of `a` that have a count of 1 in `l` and is not empty and has at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in the list, and the second element in the list `res` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is 2 * `k` - `ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range `n` to `2 * n - 1`. If `k` is true, then `re` is `k`, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is a list containing the first `k` elements of `a` that have a count of 1 in `l` and is not empty and has at least 3 elements, and `i` is the third element in the list, and the third element in the list `res` which is `i` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
