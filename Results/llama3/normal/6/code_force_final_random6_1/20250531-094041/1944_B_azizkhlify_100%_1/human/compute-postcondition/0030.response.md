Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 0 for the current value of `i` and 1 for all other `i` in range(`n`) and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` for all `i` in range(`n`), `re` is 0, `ul` is 2 if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, otherwise `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `i` is the next index in range(`n`), stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 lines of input, and the value of `a[i]` is printed twice with a space in between if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, otherwise nothing is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, except that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. This means that the program will exit the current loop or conditional statement and continue executing the code outside of it. The rest of the variables and conditions remain unchanged.
