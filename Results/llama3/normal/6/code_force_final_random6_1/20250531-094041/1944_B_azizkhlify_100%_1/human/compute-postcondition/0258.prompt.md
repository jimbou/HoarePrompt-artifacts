Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range `n` to `2 * n - 1`, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is `2 * n - 1`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the list `r` will have its elements at indices `a[i] - 1` incremented by 1 for all `i` in the range from `n` to `2 * n - 1`, while the other variables remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        l[a[i] - 1] = 0
        ul += 2
    if ul == k * 2:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `re` is 0, `ul` is either 0 or equal to 2 times `k`, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 0. If `ul` is equal to 2 times `k`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `re` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 1. If `ul` is equal to 2 times `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the value at index `a[i] - 1` in list `l` is 2, then the 2nd element of the list `a` which is `a[1]` is being printed twice and `ul` is either 2 or equal to 2 times `k` plus 2. Otherwise, no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `re` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 2. If the element at index `a[i] - 1` in list `l` is 2, then `ur` is 2, the element at index `a[i] - 1` in list `l` is 0, and the 3rd element of the list `a` which is `a[2]` is being printed twice. If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
