Output State: **n is greater than 0, i is equal to 2 * n, k is an integer equal to 4 * k - ul if ul is less than or equal to n * 2, otherwise k is an integer equal to 2 * k - n * 2, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where l[a[i] - 1] is 0 for all i in range(n) and the rest are 0, r is a list of n integers where r[a[i] - 1] is 0 for all i in range(n), re is equal to k, res is a list containing all elements from a where l[a[i] - 1] is 1, i is equal to the last element in res, nothing is printed, and res is empty, and all elements in res have been printed, and the current value of ul is either equal to ur or not equal to ur. If r[a[i] - 1] is 0, then ur is equal to ur + 2, and the value of a[i] which is equal to the last element in res is printed twice, and if ul is equal to ur, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the value of a[i] which is equal to the last element in res is printed twice, separated by a space.**
