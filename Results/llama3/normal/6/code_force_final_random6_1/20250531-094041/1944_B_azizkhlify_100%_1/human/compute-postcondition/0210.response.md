Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer equal to 2 * (previous value of k) - ul, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where l[a[i] - 1] is either 0, 1 or 2 and the rest are the same as before, r is a list of n integers where r[a[i] - 1] is either 0 or 2 and the rest are 0, re is 0, ul is either 0 or k * 2, ur is either 0, 2 or 4, res is an empty list, and i is equal to n + 2. If r[a[i] - 1] is 2, then the value of a[i] which is a[n+2] and a[i] which is a[n+2] are printed separated by a space.***
