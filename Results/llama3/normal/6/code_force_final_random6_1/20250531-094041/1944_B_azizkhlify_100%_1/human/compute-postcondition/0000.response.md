According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `int(input())`. If `int(input())` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains multiple test cases. So for the loop to be executed, stdin must contain at least 1 test case and `_` is 0.
State: **stdin contains at least 1 test case, `_` is 0**
