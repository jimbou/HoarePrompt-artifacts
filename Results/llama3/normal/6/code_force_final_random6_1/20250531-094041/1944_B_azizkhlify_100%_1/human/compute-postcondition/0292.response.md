Based on the precondition, the value of `i` is the second element in the list `res`. The list `res` contains the first `k` elements of `a` that have a count of 1 in `l` and is not empty. Since `i` is an element in `res`, it is one of the first `k` elements of `a` that have a count of 1 in `l`.

Output: **the second element in the list of the first k elements of a that have a count of 1 in l**
