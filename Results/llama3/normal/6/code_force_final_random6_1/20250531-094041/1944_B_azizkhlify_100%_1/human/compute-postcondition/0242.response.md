Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `re` is 0, `ul` is either 0 or equal to 2 times `k`, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 0. If `ul` is equal to 2 times `k`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
