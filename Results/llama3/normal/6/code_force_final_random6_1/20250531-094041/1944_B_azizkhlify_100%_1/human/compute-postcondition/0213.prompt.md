Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer equal to 2 * (previous value of `k`) - `ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is either 0, 1 or 2 and the rest are the same as before, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` and the rest are 0, `re` is 0, `ul` is either 0 or `k * 2`, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, and `i` is the last element of the original list `res` before the loop started, and all elements of the original list `res` have been printed. The current value of `ul` is not equal to the current value of `ur`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        r[a[i] - 1] = 0
        ur += 2
    if ul == ur:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer equal to 2 * (previous value of `k`) - `ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is either 0, 1 or 2 and the rest are the same as before, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is either 0 or 2 and the rest are 0, `re` is 0, `ul` is either 0 or `k` * 2, `ur` is either 0 or 2, `res` is an empty list, and `i` is equal to `n`, and all elements of the original list `res` have been printed. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer equal to 2 * (previous value of `k`) - `ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is either 0, 1 or 2 and the rest are the same as before, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is either 0 or 2 and the rest are 0, `re` is 0, `ul` is either 0 or `k` * 2, `ur` is either 0 or 2, `res` is an empty list, and `i` is equal to `n + 1`. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `r`, `ur` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer equal to 2 * (previous value of k) - ul, `a` is a list of n integers, `l` is a list of n integers where l[a[i] - 1] is either 0, 1 or 2 and the rest are the same as before, `r` is a list of n integers where r[a[i] - 1] is either 0 or 2 and the rest are 0, `re` is 0, `ul` is either 0 or k * 2, `ur` is either 0, 2 or 4, `res` is an empty list, and `i` is equal to n + 2. If ul equals ur, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
