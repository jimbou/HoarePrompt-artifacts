Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is 2 * `k` - `ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range `n` to `2 * n - 1`, `i` is 0. If `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, then the current value of `re` is 1, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, and `res` is a list containing the ith element of `a`. The current value of `re` equals `k`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `i`, `ul`, `ur`, and `res` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
