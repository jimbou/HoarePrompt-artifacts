Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer equal to 2 * (previous value of `k`) - `ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is either 0, 1 or 2 and the rest are the same as before, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` and the rest are 0, `re` is 0, `ul` is either 0 or `k * 2`, `ur` is 0, `res` is either an empty list or a list containing the first n elements of `a` or the first n-1 elements of `a` if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, and `i` is `n`. If `k` is non-zero and `re` is equal to `k`, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing without breaking out of the loop or if statement.***
