The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 1 or 2, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is either 2 or 3, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`. 
State: **n is greater than 2 or 3, k is a non-zero integer equal to 2 * (previous value of k) - ul, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where l[a[i] - 1] is either 0, 1 or 2 and the rest are the same as before, r is a list of n integers where r[a[i] - 1] is n and the rest are 0, ul is either 0 or k * 2, ur is 0, if l[a[i] - 1] is 1, then res is a list containing the first two elements of a, and i is 2. Otherwise, res is either an empty list or a list containing the first element of a, and i is 1. If re is equal to k, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, i is either 2 or 3**
