Output: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer equal to 2 * (previous value of `k`) - `ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is either 0, 1 or 2 and the rest are the same as before, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` and the rest are 0, `re` is 0, `ul` is either 0 or `k * 2`, `ur` is 0, `res` is a non-empty list containing the first `n` elements of `a` or the first `n-1` elements of `a` if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, and `i` is the second element of `res`, and the second element of `res` which is `i` is being printed**
