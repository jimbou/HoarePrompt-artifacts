The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `2 * n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least `n`, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is at least `n + 1` and for the loop to execute again `i` must be less than `2 * n`, so `n` must be greater than `i / 2` which is `n` is greater than `(n + 1) / 2` which is always true.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is increased by 1 for `i` equals to the current value of `i`, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is at least `n + 1`**
