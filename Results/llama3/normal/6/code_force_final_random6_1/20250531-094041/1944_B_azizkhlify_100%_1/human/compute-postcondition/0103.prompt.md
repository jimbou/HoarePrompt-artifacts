Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *n is greater than or equal to 0, k is an integer equal to 4 * k - ul if ul is less than or equal to n * 2, otherwise k is an integer equal to 2 * k - n * 2, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where l[a[i] - 1] is 0 for all i in range(n) and the rest are 0, r is a list of n integers where r[a[i] - 1] is n for all i in range(n), if k is non-zero, then re is equal to k and res is a list containing all elements from a where l[a[i] - 1] is 1, otherwise, re and res remain unchanged, i is equal to the last element in res, nothing is printed, and res is empty, and all elements in res have been printed. The current value of ul is not equal to ur.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        r[a[i] - 1] = 0
        ur += 2
    if ul == ur:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `k` is an integer equal to 4 * k - ul if ul is less than or equal to n * 2, otherwise k is an integer equal to 2 * k - n * 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 0 for all `i` in range(`n`) and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is either 0 or 2 for all `i` in range(`n`), if `k` is non-zero, then `re` is equal to `k` and `res` is a list containing all elements from `a` where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, otherwise, `re` and `res` remain unchanged, `i` is equal to the last element in `res`, nothing is printed, and `res` is empty, and all elements in `res` have been printed, and the current value of `ul` is either equal to `ur` or not equal to `ur`. If `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, then `ur` is equal to `ur + 2`, and the value of `a[i]` which is equal to the last element in `res` is printed twice, and if `ul` is equal to `ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `2 * n`, `k` is an integer equal to `4 * k - ul` if `ul` is less than or equal to `n * 2`, otherwise `k` is an integer equal to `2 * k - n * 2`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 0 for all `i` in range(`n`) and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is either 0 or 2 for all `i` in range(`n`), if `k` is non-zero, then `re` is equal to `k` and `res` is a list containing all elements from `a` where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, otherwise, `re` and `res` remain unchanged, `i` is equal to the last element in `res`, nothing is printed, and `res` is empty, and all elements in `res` have been printed, and the current value of `ul` is either equal to `ur` or not equal to `ur`. If `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, then `ur` is equal to `ur + 2`, and the value of `a[i]` which is equal to the last element in `res` is printed twice, and if `ul` is equal to `ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0, then `ur` is equal to `ur + 2`, and the value of `a[i]` which is equal to the last element in `res` is printed twice, separated by a space, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The program executes the if statement when `ul` is equal to `ur`, and in this case, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, then `ur` is equal to `ur` + 2, and the value of `a[i]` which is equal to the last element in `res` is printed twice, and if `ul` is equal to `ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0, then `ur` is equal to `ur` + 2, and the value of `a[i]` which is equal to the last element in `res` is printed twice, separated by a space, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, then the value of `a[i]` which is equal to the last element in `res` is printed twice, separated by a space. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, then the program does not execute the if statement and the program continues to the next statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
