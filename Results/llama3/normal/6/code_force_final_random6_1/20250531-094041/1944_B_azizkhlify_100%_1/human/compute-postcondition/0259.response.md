Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is 2 * `k` - `ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range `n` to `2 * n - 1`, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is `2 * n - 1`.**

In natural language, the output state is that the value of `k` has been updated to be twice its original value minus `ul`, while the other variables remain unchanged.
