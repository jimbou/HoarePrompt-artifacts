The code prints the value of `a[i]` twice, separated by a space, where `i` is equal to `n`. Since `i` is equal to `n`, we are accessing the `n-th` element of the list `a`. However, since list indices in Python are 0-based, the `n-th` element is actually out of bounds for a list of length `n`.

Output: **Error (IndexError: list index out of range)**
