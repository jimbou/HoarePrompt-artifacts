Output: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is 2 * `k` - `ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range `n` to `2 * n - 1`, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 0. The current value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, and the value of `a[i]` which is the ith element of the list `a` is being printed**
