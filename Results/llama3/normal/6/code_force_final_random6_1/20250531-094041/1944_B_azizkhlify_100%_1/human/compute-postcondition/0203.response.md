Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer equal to 2 * (previous value of `k`) - `ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is either 0, 1 or 2 and the rest are the same as before, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is either 0 or 2 and the rest are 0, `re` is 0, `ul` is either 0 or `k` * 2, `ur` is either 0 or 2, `res` is an empty list, and `i` is equal to `n + 1`. If `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, then `r[a[i] - 1]` is updated to 0 and `ur` is updated to either 2 or 4. Otherwise, the values of `r`, `ur` remain unchanged.***
