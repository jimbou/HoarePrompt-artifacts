To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the state of the variable `i` since it is the only variable in the loop head.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `2 * n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is greater than or equal to `2 * n` and less than `3 * n`. To make the loop execute again, `i` must be less than `2 * n`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `i` to be equal to `2 * n`.

State: **`n` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1 for all `i` in range(`n`) and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2 for `i` equals to the current value of `i` and the rest are 0, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `i` is 2 * n, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 lines of input.**
