The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer that must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[0] - 1]` is 1 and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` zeros, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `i` is 2, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 lines of input.**
