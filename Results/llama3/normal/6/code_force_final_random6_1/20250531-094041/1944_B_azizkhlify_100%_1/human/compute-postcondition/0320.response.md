Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is 2 * `k` - `ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range `n`. If `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, then `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0 for all `i` in range `n`, `ul` is unchanged, `ur` is increased by 2, `i` is `n + 1`, and `a[i]` is printed where `a[i]` is the `i`th element of the list `a`. Otherwise, the values of `ul`, `ur`, `i`, and `r` remain unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, and `l` remain the same. If `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, then `r` is updated and `ur` is increased by 2, and `i` is incremented to `n + 1`. Otherwise, `ul`, `ur`, `i`, and `r` remain unchanged. In any case, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
