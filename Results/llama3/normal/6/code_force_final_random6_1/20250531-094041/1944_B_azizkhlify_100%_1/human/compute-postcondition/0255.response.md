Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `re` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `re`, `ur`, `res`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement that we were directly inside.
