Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer equal to 2 * (previous value of k) - ul, `a` is a list of n integers, `l` is a list of n integers where l[a[i] - 1] is either 0, 1 or 2 and the rest are the same as before, `r` is a list of n integers where r[a[i] - 1] is either 0 or 2 and the rest are 0, `re` is 0, `ul` is either 0 or k * 2, `ur` is either 0, 2 or 4, `res` is an empty list, and `i` is equal to n + 2. If ul equals ur, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
