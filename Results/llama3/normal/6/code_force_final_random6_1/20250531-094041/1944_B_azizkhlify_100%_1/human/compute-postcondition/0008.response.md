Output State: **n is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, k is an integer, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where l[a[i] - 1] is 1 for all i in range(n) and the rest are 0, r is a list of n zeros, re is 0, ul is 0, ur is 0, res is an empty list, _ is 0, i is n, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 lines of input.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `l` will have a 1 at each index that corresponds to the values in list `a` minus 1, and the rest of the indices in `l` will be 0. The other variables remain unchanged. The loop variable `i` will be equal to `n` after the loop finishes executing.
