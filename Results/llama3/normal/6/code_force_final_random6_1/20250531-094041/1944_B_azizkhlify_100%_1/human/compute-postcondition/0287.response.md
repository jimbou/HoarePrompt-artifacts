Output: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is 2 * `k` - `ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range `n` to `2 * n - 1`. If `k` is true, then `re` is `k`, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is a list containing the first `k` elements of `a` that have a count of 1 in `l`, and `i` is `n`. Otherwise, the values of `re`, `ul`, `ur`, `res`, and `i` remain unchanged. and nothing is printed**
