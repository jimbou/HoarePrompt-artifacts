Postcondition: ***n is greater than 0, k is a non-zero integer equal to 4 * k - ul if ul is less than or equal to n * 2, otherwise k is a non-zero integer equal to 2 * k - n * 2, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where l[a[i] - 1] is 0 for all i in range(n) and the rest are 0, r is a list of n integers where r[a[i] - 1] is n for all i in range(n), if re is equal to k, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
