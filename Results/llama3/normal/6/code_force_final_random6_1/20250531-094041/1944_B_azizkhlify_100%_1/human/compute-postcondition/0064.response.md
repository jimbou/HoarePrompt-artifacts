Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 2, `k` is a non-zero integer equal to 4 * k - ul if ul is less than or equal to (n - 1) * 2, otherwise k is a non-zero integer equal to 2 * k - (n - 1) * 2, `a` is a list of n integers, `l` is a list of n integers where l[a[i] - 1] is 0 for all i in range(n) and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of n integers where r[a[i] - 1] is n for all i in range(n). If `re` equals `k`, then `res` is a list containing the 3rd element of the list `a` and an additional element from `a` if l[a[i] - 1] is 1, otherwise `res` is unchanged, and `re` is 2 greater than its original value if l[a[i] - 1] is 1, otherwise `re` is unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `re` equals `k`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
