To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in res:`. The only object in the loop head is `i` and `res`. 

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `res`. If `res` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` is not empty, and `i` is equal to the last element in `res`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `res` must have at least one more element, and `i` must be equal to the next element in `res`.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer equal to `4 * k - ul` if `ul` is less than or equal to `n * 2`, otherwise `k` is an integer equal to `2 * k - n * 2`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is `0` for all `i` in range(`n`) and the rest are `0`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` for all `i` in range(`n`), if `k` is non-zero, then `re` is equal to `k` and `res` is a list containing all elements from `a` where `l[a[i] - 1]` is `1`, otherwise, `re` and `res` remain unchanged, `i` is equal to the next element in `res`, nothing is printed, and `res` is not empty, and the value of `i` which is equal to the next element in `res` is printed**
