Postcondition: ***n is greater than 1, k is a non-zero integer equal to 2 * (previous value of k) - ul, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where l[a[i] - 1] is either 0, 1 or 2 and the rest are the same as before, r is a list of n integers where r[a[i] - 1] is n and the rest are 0, ul is either 0 or k * 2, ur is 0, if l[a[i] - 1] is 1, then res is a list containing the first two elements of a, and i is 2. Otherwise, res is either an empty list or a list containing the first element of a, and i is 1.***
