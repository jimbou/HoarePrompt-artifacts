Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is greater than or equal to 0, k is an integer equal to 4 * k - ul if ul is less than or equal to n * 2, otherwise k is an integer equal to 2 * k - n * 2, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where l[a[i] - 1] is 0 for all i in range(n) and the rest are 0, r is a list of n integers where r[a[i] - 1] is n for all i in range(n), if k is non-zero, then re is equal to k and res is a list containing all elements from a where l[a[i] - 1] is 1, otherwise, re and res remain unchanged, and i is equal to n, and nothing is printed
Code of the loop:
for i in res:
    print(i, end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer equal to `4 * k - ul` if `ul` is less than or equal to `n * 2`, otherwise `k` is an integer equal to `2 * k - n * 2`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is `0` for all `i` in range(`n`) and the rest are `0`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` for all `i` in range(`n`), if `k` is non-zero, then `re` is equal to `k` and `res` is a list containing all elements from `a` where `l[a[i] - 1]` is `1`, otherwise, `re` and `res` remain unchanged, `i` is equal to `n`, nothing is printed, and `res` is not empty, and the value of `i` which is equal to `n` is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer equal to `4 * k - ul` if `ul` is less than or equal to `n * 2`, otherwise `k` is an integer equal to `2 * k - n * 2`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is `0` for all `i` in range(`n`) and the rest are `0`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` for all `i` in range(`n`), if `k` is non-zero, then `re` is equal to `k` and `res` is a list containing all elements from `a` where `l[a[i] - 1]` is `1`, otherwise, `re` and `res` remain unchanged, `i` is equal to the next element in `res`, nothing is printed, and `res` is not empty, and the value of `i` which is equal to the next element in `res` is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer equal to `4 * k - ul` if `ul` is less than or equal to `n * 2`, otherwise `k` is an integer equal to `2 * k - n * 2`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is `0` for all `i` in range(`n`) and the rest are `0`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` for all `i` in range(`n`), if `k` is non-zero, then `re` is equal to `k` and `res` is a list containing all elements from `a` where `l[a[i] - 1]` is `1`, otherwise, `re` and `res` remain unchanged, `i` is equal to the next element in `res`, nothing is printed, and `res` is not empty, and the value of `i` which is equal to the next element in `res` is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
