Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer equal to 2 * (previous value of `k`) - `ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is either 0, 1 or 2 and the rest are the same as before, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is either 0 or 2 and the rest are 0, `re` is 0, `ul` is either 0 or `k` * 2, `ur` is either 0 or 2, `res` is an empty list, and `i` is equal to `n + 1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables retain their previous values, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. This means that the execution of the program will continue from the next line of code outside the loop or if statement that we broke out of.
