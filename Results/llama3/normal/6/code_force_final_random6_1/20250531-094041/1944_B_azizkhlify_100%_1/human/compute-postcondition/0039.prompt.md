Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, k is an integer, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where l[a[i] - 1] is 1 for all i in range(n) and the rest are 0, r is a list of n integers where r[a[i] - 1] is n for all i in range(n), re is 0, ul is 0, ur is 0, res is an empty list, _ is 0, i is 2 * n, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 lines of input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        l[a[i] - 1] = 0
        ul += 2
    if ul == k * 2:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where l[a[i] - 1] is 0 for the current value of i and 1 for all other i in range(n) and the rest are 0, r is a list of n integers where r[a[i] - 1] is n for all i in range(n), re is 0, ul is 2 if l[a[i] - 1] is 2, otherwise ul is 0, ur is 0, res is an empty list, _ is 0, i is the current index in range(n), stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 lines of input, and the value of a[i] is printed twice with a space in between if l[a[i] - 1] is 2, otherwise nothing is printed. If ul is equal to k * 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 0 for the current value of `i` and 1 for all other `i` in range(`n`) and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` for all `i` in range(`n`), `re` is 0, `ul` is 2 if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, otherwise `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `i` is the next index in range(`n`), stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 lines of input, and the value of `a[i]` is printed twice with a space in between if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, otherwise nothing is printed. If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 0 for the current value of `i` and 1 for all other `i` in range(`n`) and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` for all `i` in range(`n`), `re` is 0, `ul` is 2 if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, otherwise `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `i` is the next index in range(`n`), stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 lines of input. If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement and the value of `a[i]` is printed twice with a space in between if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, otherwise nothing is printed. If `ul` is not equal to `k * 2`, the program continues to the next iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
