Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `re` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 2. If the element at index `a[i] - 1` in list `l` is 2, then `ur` is 2, the element at index `a[i] - 1` in list `l` is 0, and the 3rd element of the list `a` which is `a[2]` is being printed twice. If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
