Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4, 1 <= k <= floor(n/2)). The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_2n (1 <= a_i <= n). Every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 * 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    l = [0] * n
    r = [0] * n
    re = ul = ur = 0
    res = []
    for i in range(n):
        l[a[i] - 1] += 1
    for i in range(n, 2 * n):
        r[a[i] - 1] += 1
    for i in range(n):
        if l[a[i] - 1] == 2:
            print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
            l[a[i] - 1] = 0
            ul += 2
        if ul == k * 2:
            break
    k = 2 * k - ul
    if k:
        for i in range(n):
            if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
                print(a[i], end=' ')
                re += 1
                res.append(a[i])
            if re == k:
                break
    print()
    for i in res:
        print(i, end=' ')
    if ul != ur:
        for i in range(n, 2 * n):
            if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
                print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
                r[a[i] - 1] = 0
                ur += 2
            if ul == ur:
                break
    print()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is greater than or equal to 0, k is an integer equal to 4 * k - ul if ul is less than or equal to n * 2, otherwise k is an integer equal to 2 * k - n * 2, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where l[a[i] - 1] is 0 for all i in range(n) and the rest are 0, r is a list of n integers where r[a[i] - 1] is either 0 or 2 for all i in range(n), if k is non-zero, then re is equal to k and res is a list containing all elements from a where l[a[i] - 1] is 1, otherwise, re and res remain unchanged, i is equal to the last element in res, nothing is printed, and res is empty, and all elements in res have been printed. If ul is not equal to ur, then n is greater than 0, i is equal to 2 * n, k is an integer equal to 4 * k - ul if ul is less than or equal to n * 2, otherwise k is an integer equal to 2 * k - n * 2, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where l[a[i] - 1] is 0 for all i in range(n) and the rest are 0, r is a list of n integers where r[a[i] - 1] is either 0 or 2 for all i in range(n), if k is non-zero, then re is equal to k and res is a list containing all elements from a where l[a[i] - 1] is 1, otherwise, re and res remain unchanged, i is equal to the last element in res, nothing is printed, and res is empty, and all elements in res have been printed, and the current value of ul is either equal to ur or not equal to ur. If r[a[i] - 1] is 2, then ur is equal to ur + 2, and the value of a[i] which is equal to the last element in res is printed twice, and if ul is equal to ur, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If r[a[i] - 1] is 0, then ur is equal to ur + 2, and the value of a[i] which is equal to the last element in res is printed twice, separated by a space, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If ul is equal to ur, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If r[a[i] - 1] is 2, then the value of a[i] which is equal to the last element in res is printed twice, separated by a space. If ul is not equal to ur, then the program does not execute the if statement and the program continues to the next statement, and a newline character is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer equal to 2 * (previous value of `k`) - `ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is either 0, 1 or 2 and the rest are the same as before, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0 and the rest are 0, `re` is 0, `ul` is either 0 or `k` * 2, `ur` is either 0 or a multiple of 2, `res` is an empty list, and `i` is equal to 2 * `n`, and all elements of the original list `res` have been printed. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute, and a new line is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is 2 * `k` - `ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range `n` to `2 * n - 1`. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, then `ul` is equal to `ur` and `i` is `2 * n`. If `k` is true, then `re` is `k`, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is a list containing the first `k` elements of `a` that have a count of 1 in `l` and is not empty and has at least `k` elements, and nothing is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
