Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is either 0 or 2 and the rest are the same as before, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` and the rest are 0, `re` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 1. If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, the second element of the list `a` is printed twice, separated by a space, and `ul` is 2. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
