Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `k` is a non-zero integer equal to `4 * k - ul` if `ul` is less than or equal to `n * 2`, otherwise `k` is a non-zero integer equal to `2 * k - n * 2`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 0 for all `i` in range(`n`) and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` for all `i` in range(`n`), `re` is 0, `ul` is `k * 2` if `k * 2` is less than or equal to `n * 2`, otherwise `ul` is `n * 2`, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `i` is `n`, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 lines of input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
        print(a[i], end=' ')
        re += 1
        res.append(a[i])
    if re == k:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is greater than 0, k is a non-zero integer equal to 4 * k - ul if ul is less than or equal to n * 2, otherwise k is a non-zero integer equal to 2 * k - n * 2, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where l[a[i] - 1] is 0 for all i in range(n) and the rest are 0, r is a list of n integers where r[a[i] - 1] is n for all i in range(n), if re is equal to k, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is greater than 1, k is a non-zero integer equal to 4 * k - ul if ul is less than or equal to (n - 1) * 2, otherwise k is a non-zero integer equal to 2 * k - (n - 1) * 2, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where l[a[i] - 1] is 0 for all i in range(n) and the rest are 0, r is a list of n integers where r[a[i] - 1] is n for all i in range(n). If l[a[i] - 1] is 1, then i is 2, res is a list containing the 2nd element of the list a, and re is 1 greater than its original value. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if re equals k.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than 2, `k` is a non-zero integer equal to 4 * k - ul if ul is less than or equal to (n - 1) * 2, otherwise k is a non-zero integer equal to 2 * k - (n - 1) * 2, `a` is a list of n integers, `l` is a list of n integers where l[a[i] - 1] is 0 for all i in range(n) and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of n integers where r[a[i] - 1] is n for all i in range(n). If `re` equals `k`, then `res` is a list containing the 3rd element of the list `a` and an additional element from `a` if l[a[i] - 1] is 1, otherwise `res` is unchanged, and `re` is 2 greater than its original value if l[a[i] - 1] is 1, otherwise `re` is unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `re` equals `k`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
