Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer equal to 2 * (previous value of k) - ul, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where l[a[i] - 1] is either 0, 1 or 2 and the rest are the same as before, r is a list of n integers where r[a[i] - 1] is 0 and the rest are 0, re is 0, ul is either 0 or k * 2, ur is either 2 or 4, res is an empty list, and i is equal to n + 2, and the value of a[i] which is a[n+2] and a[i] which is a[n+2] are printed separated by a space.**

The first line sets the value of `r[a[i] - 1]` to 0. Since `i` is equal to `n + 2`, this means that the value of `r[a[n+2] - 1]` is set to 0. The second line increments the value of `ur` by 2. Since `ur` is either 0 or 2, this means that `ur` is now either 2 or 4. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
