Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1 for all `i` in range(`n`) and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2 for `i` equals to the current value of `i` and the rest are 0, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `i` is greater than or equal to `2 * n` and less than `3 * n`, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 lines of input.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state except that the value of `r[a[i] - 1]` has been incremented by 1, making it 2 for the current value of `i`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
