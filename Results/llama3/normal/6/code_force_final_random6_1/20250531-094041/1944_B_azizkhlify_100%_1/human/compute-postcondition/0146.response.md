Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is either 0 or 2 and the rest are the same as before, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` and the rest are 0, `re` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 2. If `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, then `ul` is increased by 2 and the third element of the list `a` which is `a[2]` is printed twice. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
