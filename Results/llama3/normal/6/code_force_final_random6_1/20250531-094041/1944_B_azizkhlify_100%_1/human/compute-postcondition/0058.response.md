State: **n is greater than 2, k is a non-zero integer equal to 4 * k - ul if ul is less than or equal to (n - 1) * 2, otherwise k is a non-zero integer equal to 2 * k - (n - 1) * 2, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where l[a[i] - 1] is 0 for all i in range(n) and the rest are 0, r is a list of n integers where r[a[i] - 1] is n for all i in range(n). If l[a[i] - 1] is 1, then i is 3, res is a list containing the 3rd element of the list a, and re is 1 greater than its original value. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if re equals k.**
