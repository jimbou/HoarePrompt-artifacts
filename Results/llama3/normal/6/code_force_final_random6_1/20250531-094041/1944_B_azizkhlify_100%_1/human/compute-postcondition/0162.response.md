The code prints the element at index `i` of the list `a`, where `i` is 1. Since `i` is 1, the code will print the second element of the list `a`. The value of the second element of the list `a` is not explicitly provided in the precondition, but we know that `a` is a list of `n` integers. Therefore, the code will print the second integer in the list `a`.

Output: **the second element of the list a (which is an integer)**
