Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer equal to 2 * (previous value of `k`) - `ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is either 0, 1 or 2 and the rest are the same as before, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` and the rest are 0, `re` is 0, `ul` is either 0 or `k * 2`, `ur` is 0, `res` is either an empty list or a list containing the first n elements of `a` or the first n-1 elements of `a` if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, and `i` is `n`. If `k` is non-zero and `re` is equal to `k`, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing without breaking out of the loop or if statement, and nothing is printed
Code of the loop:
for i in res:
    print(i, end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer equal to 2 * (previous value of `k`) - `ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is either 0, 1 or 2 and the rest are the same as before, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` and the rest are 0, `re` is 0, `ul` is either 0 or `k * 2`, `ur` is 0, `res` is a non-empty list containing the first `n` elements of `a` or the first `n-1` elements of `a` if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, and `i` is the first element of `res`, and the first element of `res` which is `i` is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer equal to 2 * (previous value of `k`) - `ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is either 0, 1 or 2 and the rest are the same as before, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` and the rest are 0, `re` is 0, `ul` is either 0 or `k * 2`, `ur` is 0, `res` is a non-empty list containing the first `n` elements of `a` or the first `n-1` elements of `a` if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, and `i` is the second element of `res`, and the second element of `res` which is `i` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer equal to 2 * (previous value of `k`) - `ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is either 0, 1 or 2 and the rest are the same as before, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` and the rest are 0, `re` is 0, `ul` is either 0 or `k * 2`, `ur` is 0, `res` is a non-empty list containing the first `n` elements of `a` or the first `n-1` elements of `a` if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, and `i` is the third element of `res`, and the third element of `res` which is `i` is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
