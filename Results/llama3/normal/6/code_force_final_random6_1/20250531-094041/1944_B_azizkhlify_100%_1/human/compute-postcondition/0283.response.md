Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `k` is 2 * `ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range `n` to `2 * n - 1`, `i` is 2. If `re` is equal to `k`, then if `l[a[2] - 1]` is 1, `re` is 3, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, and `res` is a list containing the 3rd element of `a` which is `a[2]`. If `l[a[2] - 1]` is not 1, then no changes are made to `re`, `ul`, `ur`, or `res`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
