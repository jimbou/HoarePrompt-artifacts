The code prints the value of `a[i]`, where `a` is a list of `n` integers and `i` is the current index, which is 0.

Since `i` is 0, `a[i]` refers to the first element of the list `a`. The value of this element is not explicitly provided in the initial state, so we can only describe it as the first element of the list `a`.

Output: **the first element of the list a**
