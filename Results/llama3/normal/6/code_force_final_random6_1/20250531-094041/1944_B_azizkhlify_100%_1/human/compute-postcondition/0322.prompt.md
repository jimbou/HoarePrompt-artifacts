Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is 2 * `k` - `ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range `n` to `2 * n - 1`. If `k` is true, then `re` is `k`, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is a list containing the first `k` elements of `a` that have a count of 1 in `l` and is not empty and has at least `k` elements, and `i` is the last element in the list, and the last element in the list `res` which is `i` is being printed. The current value of `ul` is not equal to the current value of `ur`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        r[a[i] - 1] = 0
        ur += 2
    if ul == ur:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is greater than 0, k is 2 * k - ul, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where l[a[i] - 1] is increased by 1 for all i in range n, r is a list of n integers where r[a[i] - 1] is either 0 or 2 and r[a[j] - 1] is increased by 1 for all j in range n to 2 * n - 1 and j is not equal to i, if r[a[i] - 1] is 2, ul is increased by 2, i is n. If ul is equal to ur, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is greater than 0, k is 2 * k - ul, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where l[a[i] - 1] is increased by 1 for all i in range n, r is a list of n integers where r[a[i] - 1] is either 0 or 2 and r[a[j] - 1] is increased by 1 for all j in range n to 2 * n - 1 and j is not equal to i. If r[a[i] - 1] is 2, ul is increased by 2, ur is increased by 2 and i is n + 1. Otherwise, the values of ul, ur and i remain unchanged. If ul is equal to ur, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is greater than 0, k is 2 * k - ul, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where l[a[i] - 1] is increased by 1 for all i in range n. If r[a[i] - 1] is 2, then r is a list of n integers where r[a[i] - 1] is 0 for all i in range n, ul is unchanged, ur is increased by 2, i is n + 1, and a[i] is printed where a[i] is the ith element of the list a. Otherwise, the values of ul, ur, i, and r remain unchanged. If ul is equal to ur, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of ul, ur, i, and r remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
