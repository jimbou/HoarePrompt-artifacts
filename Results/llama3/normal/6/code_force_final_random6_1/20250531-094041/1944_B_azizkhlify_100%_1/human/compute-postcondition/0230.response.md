State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is increased by 1 for `i` equals to the current value of `i` and also increased by 1 at index `a[i] - 1`, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is at least `n + 2`**
