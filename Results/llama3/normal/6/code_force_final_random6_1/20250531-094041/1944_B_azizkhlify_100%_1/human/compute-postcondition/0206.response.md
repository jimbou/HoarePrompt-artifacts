The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `2 * n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is `n + 2` and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer equal to 2 * (previous value of `k`) - `ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is either 0, 1 or 2 and the rest are the same as before, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is either 0 or 2 and the rest are 0, `re` is 0, `ul` is either 0 or `k` * 2, `ur` is either 0 or 2, `res` is an empty list, and `i` is equal to `n + 2**
