Postcondition: ***n is greater than 2 or 3, k is a non-zero integer equal to 2 * (previous value of k) - ul, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where l[a[i] - 1] is either 0, 1 or 2 and the rest are the same as before, r is a list of n integers where r[a[i] - 1] is n and the rest are 0, ul is either 0 or k * 2, ur is 0, if l[a[i] - 1] is 1, then res is a list containing the first three elements of a, otherwise res is either an empty list or a list containing the first two elements of a, and i is 3. If re is equal to k, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing without breaking out of the loop or if statement.***
