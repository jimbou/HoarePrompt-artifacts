Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer equal to 2 * (previous value of `k`) - `ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is either 0, 1 or 2 and the rest are the same as before, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` and the rest are 0, `re` is 0, `ul` is either 0 or `k * 2`, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, and `i` is the last element of the original list `res` before the loop started, and all elements of the original list `res` have been printed. The current value of `ul` is not equal to the current value of `ur`.***
