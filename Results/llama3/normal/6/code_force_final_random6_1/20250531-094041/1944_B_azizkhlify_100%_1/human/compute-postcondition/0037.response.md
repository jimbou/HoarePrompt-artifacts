Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 0 for the current value of `i` and 1 for all other `i` in range(`n`) and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` for all `i` in range(`n`), `re` is 0, `ul` is 2 if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, otherwise `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `i` is the next index in range(`n`), stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 lines of input, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, the value of `a[i]` is printed twice with a space in between. If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement and the value of `a[i]` is printed twice with a space in between if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, otherwise nothing is printed.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables remain the same, but the program's control flow changes. If certain conditions are met, the value of `a[i]` is printed twice with a space in between.
