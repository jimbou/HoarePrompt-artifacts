The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than `2 * n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be `n + 1`.
State: **`n` is an integer that must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is the number of occurrences of `a[i]` in `a` and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2 and the rest are 0, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is `n + 1`, nothing is printed, and stdin contains no input.**
