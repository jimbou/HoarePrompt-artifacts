Output: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer equal to `4 * k - ul` if `ul` is less than or equal to `n * 2`, otherwise `k` is an integer equal to `2 * k - n * 2`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is `0` for all `i` in range(`n`) and the rest are `0`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` for all `i` in range(`n`), if `k` is non-zero, then `re` is equal to `k` and `res` is a list containing all elements from `a` where `l[a[i] - 1]` is `1`, otherwise, `re` and `res` remain unchanged, `i` is equal to `n`, nothing is printed, and `res` is not empty, and the value of `i` which is equal to `n` is printed**
