Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `k` is a non-zero integer equal to 2 * (previous value of `k`) - `ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is either 0 or 2 and the rest are the same as before, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` and the rest are 0, `re` is 0, `ul` is either 0 or `k * 2`, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is `n`, nothing is printed, and stdin contains no input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
        print(a[i], end=' ')
        re += 1
        res.append(a[i])
    if re == k:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than 0, `k` is a non-zero integer equal to 2 * (previous value of `k`) - `ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is either 0, 1 or 2 and the rest are the same as before, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` and the rest are 0, `ul` is either 0 or `k * 2`, `ur` is 0, `res` is either an empty list or a list containing the first element of `a`, and `i` is 0. If `re` is equal to `k`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is greater than 1, k is a non-zero integer equal to 2 * (previous value of k) - ul, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where l[a[i] - 1] is either 0, 1 or 2 and the rest are the same as before, r is a list of n integers where r[a[i] - 1] is n and the rest are 0, ul is either 0 or k * 2, ur is 0, if l[a[i] - 1] is 1, then res is a list containing the first two elements of a, and i is 2. Otherwise, res is either an empty list or a list containing the first element of a, and i is 1. If re is equal to k, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is greater than 2 or 3, k is a non-zero integer equal to 2 * (previous value of k) - ul, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where l[a[i] - 1] is either 0, 1 or 2 and the rest are the same as before, r is a list of n integers where r[a[i] - 1] is n and the rest are 0, ul is either 0 or k * 2, ur is 0, if l[a[i] - 1] is 1, then res is a list containing the first three elements of a, otherwise res is either an empty list or a list containing the first two elements of a, and i is 3. If re is equal to k, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing without breaking out of the loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
