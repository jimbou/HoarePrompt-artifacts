Postcondition: ***n is greater than 0, k is 2 * k - ul, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where l[a[i] - 1] is increased by 1 for all i in range n, r is a list of n integers where r[a[i] - 1] is either 0 or 2 and r[a[j] - 1] is increased by 1 for all j in range n to 2 * n - 1 and j is not equal to i. If r[a[i] - 1] is 2, ul is increased by 2, ur is increased by 2 and i is n + 1. Otherwise, the values of ul, ur and i remain unchanged.***
