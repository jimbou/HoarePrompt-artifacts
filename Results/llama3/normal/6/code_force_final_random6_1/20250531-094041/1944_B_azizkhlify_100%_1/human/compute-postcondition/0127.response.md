Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is the number of occurrences of `a[i]` in `a` and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` and the rest are 0, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 0, nothing is printed, and stdin contains no input. The current value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, indicating that the number of occurrences of `a[i]` in `a` is exactly 2.**
