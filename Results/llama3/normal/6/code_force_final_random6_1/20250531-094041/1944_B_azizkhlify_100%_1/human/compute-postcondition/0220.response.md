Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is increased by 1, `r` is a list of `n` zeros, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is increased by 1, where `a[i]` is the first element of the list `a` because `i` is 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
