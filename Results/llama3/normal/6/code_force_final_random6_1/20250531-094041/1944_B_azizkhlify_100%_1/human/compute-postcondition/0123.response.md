Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is the number of occurrences of `a[i]` in `a` and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is 3 and the rest are 0, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is `n + 1`, nothing is printed, and stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `r[a[i] - 1]` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `r[a[i] - 1]` being 3. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
