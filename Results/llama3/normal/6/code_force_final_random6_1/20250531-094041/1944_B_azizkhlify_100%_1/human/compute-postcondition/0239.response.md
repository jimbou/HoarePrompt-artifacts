Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 0. If `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, then `l[a[i] - 1]` is 0, `ul` is 2, and `r[a[i] - 1]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range `n` to `2 * n - 1`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
