Output: **n is greater than 0, k is 2 * k - ul, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where l[a[i] - 1] is increased by 1 for all i in range n, r is a list of n integers where r[a[i] - 1] is either 0 or 2 and r[a[j] - 1] is increased by 1 for all j in range n to 2 * n - 1 and j is not equal to i, if r[a[i] - 1] is 2, ul is increased by 2, i is n + 1. If ul is equal to ur, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the value of a[i] is printed twice with a space in between, but since i is n + 1 which is out of range of the list a, an "IndexError: list index out of range" will be printed**
