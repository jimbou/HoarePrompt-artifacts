The code prints the third element in the list `res` which contains the first `k` elements of `a` that have a count of 1 in `l` and is not empty and has at least 3 elements, and the value of `i` which is the third element in the list `res`.
Output: **the third element in the list res (which contains the first k elements of a that have a count of 1 in l and is not empty and has at least 3 elements), the third element in the list res (which contains the first k elements of a that have a count of 1 in l and is not empty and has at least 3 elements)**
