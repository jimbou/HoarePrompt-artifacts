Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is either 0 or 2 and the rest are the same as before, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` and the rest are 0, `re` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 0. If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
