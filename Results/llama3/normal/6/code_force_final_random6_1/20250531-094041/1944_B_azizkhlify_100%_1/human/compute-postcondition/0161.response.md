The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `k` is a non-zero integer equal to 2 * (previous value of `k`) - `ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is either 0, 1 or 2 and the rest are the same as before, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` and the rest are 0, `ul` is either 0 or `k * 2`, `ur` is 0, `res` is either an empty list or a list containing the first element of `a`, and `i` is 1**
