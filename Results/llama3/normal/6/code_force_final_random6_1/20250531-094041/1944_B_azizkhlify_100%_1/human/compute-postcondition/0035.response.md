Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where l[a[i] - 1] is 0 for the current value of i and 1 for all other i in range(n) and the rest are 0, r is a list of n integers where r[a[i] - 1] is n for all i in range(n), re is 0, ul is 2 if l[a[i] - 1] is 2, otherwise ul is 0, ur is 0, res is an empty list, _ is 0, i is the next index in range(n), stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 lines of input, and the value of a[i] is printed twice with a space in between if l[a[i] - 1] is 2, otherwise nothing is printed. If ul is equal to k * 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and this is printed: the value of a[i] twice with a space in between if l[a[i] - 1] is 2, otherwise nothing is printed.**

The code modifies the value of `l[a[i] - 1]` to 0 and increments `ul` by 2. The value of `ul` is now 2 if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, otherwise it is 0. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
