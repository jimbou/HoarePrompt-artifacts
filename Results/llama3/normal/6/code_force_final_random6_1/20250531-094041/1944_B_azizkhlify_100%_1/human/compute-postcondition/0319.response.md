Postcondition: ***n is greater than 0, k is 2 * k - ul, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where l[a[i] - 1] is increased by 1 for all i in range n. If r[a[i] - 1] is 2, then r is a list of n integers where r[a[i] - 1] is 0 for all i in range n, ul is unchanged, ur is increased by 2, i is n + 1, and a[i] is printed where a[i] is the ith element of the list a. Otherwise, the values of ul, ur, i, and r remain unchanged.***
