Output: **n is greater than or equal to 0, k is an integer equal to 4 * k - ul if ul is less than or equal to n * 2, otherwise k is an integer equal to 2 * k - n * 2, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where l[a[i] - 1] is 0 for all i in range(n) and the rest are 0, r is a list of n integers where r[a[i] - 1] is either 0 or 2 for all i in range(n), if k is non-zero, then re is equal to k and res is a list containing all elements from a where l[a[i] - 1] is 1, otherwise, re and res remain unchanged, i is equal to the last element in res, nothing is printed, and res is empty, and all elements in res have been printed. If ul is not equal to ur, then n is greater than 0, i is equal to 2 * n, k is an integer equal to 4 * k - ul if ul is less than or equal to n * 2, otherwise k is an integer equal to 2 * k - n * 2, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where l[a[i] - 1] is 0 for all i in range(n) and the rest are 0, r is a list of n integers where r[a[i] - 1] is either 0 or 2 for all i in range(n), if k is non-zero, then re is equal to k and res is a list containing all elements from a where l[a[i] - 1] is 1, otherwise, re and res remain unchanged, i is equal to the last element in res, nothing is printed, and res is empty, and all elements in res have been printed, and the current value of ul is either equal to ur or not equal to ur. If r[a[i] - 1] is 2, then ur is equal to ur + 2, and the value of a[i] which is equal to the last element in res is printed twice, and if ul is equal to ur, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If r[a[i] - 1] is 0, then ur is equal to ur + 2, and the value of a[i] which is equal to the last element in res is printed twice, separated by a space, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If ul is equal to ur, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If r[a[i] - 1] is 2, then the value of a[i] which is equal to the last element in res is printed twice, separated by a space. If ul is not equal to ur, then the program does not execute the if statement and the program continues to the next statement, and a newline character is printed**
