Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `k` is a non-zero integer equal to 2 * (previous value of `k`) - `ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is either 0, 1 or 2 and the rest are the same as before, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` and the rest are 0, `re` is either 0 or 1, `ul` is either 0 or `k * 2`, `ur` is 0, `res` is either an empty list or a list containing the first element of `a`, `i` is 0. If `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, then `re` is 1 and `res` contains the first element of `a`. Otherwise, `re` is 0 and `res` is an empty list.***
