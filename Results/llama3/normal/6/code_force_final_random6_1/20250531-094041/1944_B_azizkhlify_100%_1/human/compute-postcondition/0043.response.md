Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `k` is a non-zero integer equal to `4 * k - ul` if `ul` is less than or equal to `n * 2`, otherwise `k` is a non-zero integer equal to `2 * k - n * 2`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1 for all `i` in range(`n`) and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` for all `i` in range(`n`), `re` is 0, `ul` is `k * 2` if `k * 2` is less than or equal to `n * 2`, otherwise `ul` is `n * 2`, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 lines of input. The current value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1***
