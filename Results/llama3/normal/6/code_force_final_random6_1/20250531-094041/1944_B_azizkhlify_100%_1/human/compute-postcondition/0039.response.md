Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, k is an integer, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where l[a[i] - 1] is 0 for all i in range(n) and the rest are 0, r is a list of n integers where r[a[i] - 1] is n for all i in range(n), re is 0, ul is k * 2 if k * 2 is less than or equal to n * 2, otherwise ul is n * 2, ur is 0, res is an empty list, _ is 0, i is n, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 lines of input.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

- The value of `n` remains unchanged, which is an integer greater than or equal to 0.
- The value of `k` remains unchanged, which is an integer.
- The list `a` remains unchanged, which is a list of `n` integers.
- The list `l` is modified such that `l[a[i] - 1]` is 0 for all `i` in range(`n`) and the rest are 0.
- The list `r` remains unchanged, which is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` for all `i` in range(`n`).
- The value of `re` remains unchanged, which is 0.
- The value of `ul` is either `k * 2` if `k * 2` is less than or equal to `n * 2`, otherwise it is `n * 2`.
- The value of `ur` remains unchanged, which is 0.
- The list `res` remains unchanged, which is an empty list.
- The value of `_` remains unchanged, which is 0.
- The value of `i` is `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations.
- The stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 lines of input.

Note that the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement when `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, and the value of `a[i]` is printed twice with a space in between if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, otherwise nothing is printed.
