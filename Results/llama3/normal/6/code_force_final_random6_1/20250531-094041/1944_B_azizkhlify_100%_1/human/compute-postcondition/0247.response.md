Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `re` is 0, `ul` is either 0 or equal to 2 times `k`, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 1. If the value at index `a[i] - 1` in list `l` is 2, then the 2nd element of the list `a` which is `a[1]` is being printed twice and `ul` is either 2 or equal to 2 times `k` plus 2. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
