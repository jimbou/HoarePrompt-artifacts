Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[0] - 1]` is 1 and `l[a[2] - 1]` is 1 and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` zeros, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `i` is 2, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 lines of input.**

In this output state, the value of `l[a[2] - 1]` has been incremented by 1, making it 1, while the rest of the values in `l` remain the same. The other variables remain unchanged.
