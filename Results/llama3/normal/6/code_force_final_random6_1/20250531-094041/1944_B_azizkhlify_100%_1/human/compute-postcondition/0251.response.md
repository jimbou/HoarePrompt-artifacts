The code prints the value of `a[i]` twice, separated by a space, without appending a newline character at the end.

Since `i` is 2, `a[i]` refers to the third element of the list `a`. The precondition states that `a` is a list of `n` integers, but it does not provide the exact values of these integers. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `a[i]`.

However, we can describe the output as the third element of the list `a`, printed twice, separated by a space.

Output: **a[2] a[2]**
