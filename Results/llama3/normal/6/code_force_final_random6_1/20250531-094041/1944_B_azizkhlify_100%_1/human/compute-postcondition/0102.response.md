Postcondition: **The program executes the if statement when `ul` is equal to `ur`, and in this case, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, then `ur` is equal to `ur` + 2, and the value of `a[i]` which is equal to the last element in `res` is printed twice, and if `ul` is equal to `ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0, then `ur` is equal to `ur` + 2, and the value of `a[i]` which is equal to the last element in `res` is printed twice, separated by a space, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, then the value of `a[i]` which is equal to the last element in `res` is printed twice, separated by a space. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, then the program does not execute the if statement and the program continues to the next statement.**
