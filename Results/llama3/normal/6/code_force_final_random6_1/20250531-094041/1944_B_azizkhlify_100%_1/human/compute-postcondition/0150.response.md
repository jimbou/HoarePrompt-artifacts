Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer equal to 2 * (previous value of `k`) - `ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is either 0 or 2 and the rest are the same as before, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` and the rest are 0, `re` is 0, `ul` is either 0 or `k * 2`, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is `n`, nothing is printed, and stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `k` has been updated to be twice its previous value minus `ul`. All other variables remain unchanged, and the program state is the same as before, with no input in stdin and no output printed.
