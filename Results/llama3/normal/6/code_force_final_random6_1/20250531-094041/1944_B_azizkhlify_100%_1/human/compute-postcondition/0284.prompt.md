Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is 2 * `k` - `ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range `n` to `2 * n - 1`, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is `2 * n - 1`. The current value of `k` is not zero.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
        print(a[i], end=' ')
        re += 1
        res.append(a[i])
    if re == k:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than 0, `k` is 2 * `k` - `ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range `n` to `2 * n - 1`, `i` is 0. If `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, then `re` is 1, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, and `res` is a list containing the ith element of `a`. If the current value of `re` equals `k`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than 0, `k` is 2 * `k` - `ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range `n` to `2 * n - 1`, `i` is 1. If `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, then `re` is 2, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, and `res` is a list containing the ith element of `a`. If `l[a[i] - 1]` is not 1, then no changes are made to `re`, `ul`, `ur`, or `res`. If `re` is equal to `k`, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 1, `k` is 2 * `ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range `n` to `2 * n - 1`, `i` is 2. If `re` is equal to `k`, then if `l[a[2] - 1]` is 1, `re` is 3, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, and `res` is a list containing the 3rd element of `a` which is `a[2]`. If `l[a[2] - 1]` is not 1, then no changes are made to `re`, `ul`, `ur`, or `res`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
