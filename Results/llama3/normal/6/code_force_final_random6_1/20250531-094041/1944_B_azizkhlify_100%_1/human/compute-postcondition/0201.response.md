Output: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer equal to 2 * (previous value of `k`) - `ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is either 0, 1 or 2 and the rest are the same as before, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is either 0 or 2 and the rest are 0, `re` is 0, `ul` is either 0 or `k` * 2, `ur` is either 0 or 2, `res` is an empty list, and `i` is equal to `n + 1`, and this is printed: "a[n+1] a[n+1]"**
