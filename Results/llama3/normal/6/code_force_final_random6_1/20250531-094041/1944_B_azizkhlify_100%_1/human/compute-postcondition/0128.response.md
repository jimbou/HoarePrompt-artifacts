The code prints the value of `a[i]` twice, separated by a space, without appending a newline character at the end.

Since `i` is 0 and `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, indicating that the number of occurrences of `a[i]` in `a` is exactly 2, we can infer that `a[i]` is an integer that appears twice in the list `a`.

However, the exact value of `a[i]` is not provided in the precondition. Therefore, we can only describe the output in terms of the value of `a[i]`.

Output: **a[i] a[i] (where a[i] is the integer at index i in the list a, which appears exactly twice in the list)**
