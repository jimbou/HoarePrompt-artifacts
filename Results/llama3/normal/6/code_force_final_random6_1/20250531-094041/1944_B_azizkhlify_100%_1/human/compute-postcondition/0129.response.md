Output: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is the number of occurrences of `a[i]` in `a` and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` and the rest are 0, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 0, and the value of `a[i]` is printed twice, separated by a space, where `a[i]` is the element at index `i` in the list `a` and its value is the same as the value of `a[i]` which is the element at index `i` in the list `a`**
