Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is increased by 1 for `i` equals to the current value of `i`, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is at least `n`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is increased by 1 for the current value of `i`, while the other variables remain unchanged.
