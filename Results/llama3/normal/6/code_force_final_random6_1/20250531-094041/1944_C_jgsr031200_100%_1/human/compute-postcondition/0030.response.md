The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.
State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of integers where the value at index `i` is the frequency of `i` in `arr`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.**
