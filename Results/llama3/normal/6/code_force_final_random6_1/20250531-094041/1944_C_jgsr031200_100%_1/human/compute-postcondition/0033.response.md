Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of integers where the value at index `i` is the frequency of `i` in `arr`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `cou` is increased by 1. If the frequency of `i` in `arr` is 2 or more, the program moves on to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program does nothing.**

In this output state, the value of `cou` has been incremented by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. The program still checks the frequency of `i` in `arr` and moves on to the next iteration of the loop if the frequency is 2 or more, or does nothing otherwise.
