Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of integers where the value at index `i` is the frequency of `i` in `arr`, `i` is `n`, `n` is the length of `arr`, `cou` is the number of elements in `arr` that appear only once.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `n`, which is the length of the list `arr`. The list `freq` will still contain the frequency of each element in `arr`, and the variable `cou` will hold the count of elements in `arr` that appear only once. The list `arr` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
