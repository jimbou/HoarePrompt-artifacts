Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of zeros with length equal to the maximum value in `arr` plus one.**

In this output state, the list `arr` remains unchanged as it was in the initial state. The new variable `freq` is introduced, which is a list of zeros with a length equal to the maximum value in `arr` plus one. This means that if the maximum value in `arr` is `n`, then `freq` will have `n+1` elements, all initialized to zero.
