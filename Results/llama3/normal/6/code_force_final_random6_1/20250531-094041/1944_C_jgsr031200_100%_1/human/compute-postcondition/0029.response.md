Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of integers where the value at index `i` is the frequency of `i` in `arr`, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1. If `cou` equals 2 or the frequency of `i` in `arr` is 0, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement and the value of `i` which is 1 is being printed. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
