Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the final score of a game played between Alice and Bob. The game involves picking elements from an array and appending them to another array, with the goal of maximizing or minimizing the MEX (minimum excludant) of the resulting array.

The program uses a frequency array `freq` to count the occurrences of each element in the input array `arr`. It then iterates through the frequency array, checking for elements that appear only once or not at all. The first such element is printed as the final score.

The program's logic is correct, as it accurately implements the strategy for finding the final score of the game. The use of the frequency array allows for efficient counting of element occurrences, and the iteration through the frequency array ensures that the first element that meets the conditions is printed.

However, there is a small issue with the program. The function `func_1(arr)` is called, but its definition is not provided in the given code. Assuming that the function is defined elsewhere and correctly implements the logic described above, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
