Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of integers where the value at index `i` is the frequency of `i` in `arr`, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `cou` is increased by 1, If the frequency of `i` in `arr` is 2 or more, the program skips to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no action is taken.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of non-negative integers `arr` and the frequency list `freq` remain unchanged. The value of `cou` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` is still 1, and `n` is still greater than or equal to 1. The program's behavior regarding the frequency of `i` in `arr` also remains the same.
