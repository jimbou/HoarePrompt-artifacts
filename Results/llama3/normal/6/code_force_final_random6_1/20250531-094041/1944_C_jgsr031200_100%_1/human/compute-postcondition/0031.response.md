The code `continue` skips the rest of the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration of the loop. Since the initial state does not specify any loop, we assume that this `continue` statement is inside a loop.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of integers where the value at index `i` is the frequency of `i` in `arr`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, and we move on to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we move on to the next iteration of the loop. The values of `arr`, `freq`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.
