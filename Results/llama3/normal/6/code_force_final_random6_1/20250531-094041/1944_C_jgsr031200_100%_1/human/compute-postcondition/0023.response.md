Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of integers where the value at index `i` is the frequency of `i` in `arr`, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1. If the frequency of `i` in `arr` is 2 or more, the program skips to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
