To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the list `arr`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If `arr` is not empty, the loop can execute. Since `arr` is a list of non-negative integers, we can adjust its state to ensure it has at least one element.

State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `freq` is a list of zeros with length equal to the maximum value in `arr` plus one, `i` is the first element in `arr`**
