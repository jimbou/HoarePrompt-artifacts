Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of integers where the value at index `i` is the frequency of `i` in `arr`, `i` is 0, `cou` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0. The current value of `freq[i]` is greater than or equal to 2 and we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop or if statement and move to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop or if statement and move to the next iteration of the loop. The values of the variables do not change, but the execution of the program continues with the next iteration of the loop.
