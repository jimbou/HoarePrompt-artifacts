The value of `freq[i]` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` is the second element in `arr`. The value of `freq[i]` was 0 before the increment. So, the value of `freq[i]` is now 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, `freq` is a list of integers where the value at index `i` (which is the second element in `arr`) is 1 and all other values are 0, `i` is the second element in `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, `freq` is a list of integers where the value at index `i` (which is the second element in `arr`) is 1 and all other values are 0, `i` is the second element in `arr`.**
