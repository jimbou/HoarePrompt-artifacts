Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `freq` is a list of integers where the value at index `i` (which is the first element in `arr`) is 1 and all other values are 0, `i` is the first element in `arr`**

In this output state, the value of `freq[i]` has been incremented by 1, where `i` is the first element in the list `arr`. The other elements in `freq` remain 0. The values of `arr` and `i` are unchanged.
