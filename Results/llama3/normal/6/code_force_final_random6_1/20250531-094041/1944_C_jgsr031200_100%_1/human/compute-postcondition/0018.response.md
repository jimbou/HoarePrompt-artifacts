Output: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of integers where the value at index `i` is the frequency of `i` in `arr`, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0. If the frequency of the current element `i` in `arr` is exactly 1, then the current value of `cou` is 2. Otherwise, the current value of `freq[i]` is 0, and the value of `i` which is 0 is being printed**
