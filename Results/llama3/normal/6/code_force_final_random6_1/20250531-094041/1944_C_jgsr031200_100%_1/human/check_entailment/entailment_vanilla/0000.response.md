Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the final score of a game played between Alice and Bob on an array. The game's score is defined as the MEX (minimum excludant) of the array c, which is the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array.

The program first reads the input, which includes the number of test cases, the size of the array, and the elements of the array. It then defines a function func_1 that takes the array as input and calculates the frequency of each element in the array.

The function then iterates over the frequency array and checks for the first element that has a frequency of 1 or 0. If it finds an element with a frequency of 1, it increments a counter. If it finds an element with a frequency of 0, or if the counter is equal to 2, it prints the current index and breaks the loop.

The reasoning behind this approach is that Alice wants to maximize the score, so she will try to pick elements that will make the MEX of the array c as large as possible. Bob, on the other hand, wants to minimize the score, so he will try to pick elements that will make the MEX of the array c as small as possible.

By iterating over the frequency array and checking for elements with a frequency of 1 or 0, the program is essentially simulating the game and finding the optimal strategy for both players. The program prints the index of the first element that has a frequency of 1 or 0, which represents the final score of the game.

Correctness: **True**
