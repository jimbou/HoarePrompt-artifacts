Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of integers where the value at index `i` is the frequency of `i` in `arr`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2. If the frequency of `i` in `arr` is 1, `cou` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the program does nothing. If `cou` equals 2 or `freq[i]` equals 0, the value of `i` which is 2 is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
