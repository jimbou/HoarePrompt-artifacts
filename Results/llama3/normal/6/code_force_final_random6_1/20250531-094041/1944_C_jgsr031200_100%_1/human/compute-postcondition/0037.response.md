Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of integers where the value at index `i` is the frequency of `i` in `arr`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2. If the frequency of `i` in `arr` is 1, `cou` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the program does nothing, and the value of `i` which is 2 is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `arr`, `freq`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. The value of `cou` is increased by 1 only if the frequency of `i` (which is 2) in `arr` is 1. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the value of `i` (which is 2) is being printed.
