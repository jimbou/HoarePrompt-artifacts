#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of non-negative integers.
    freq = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in arr:
        freq[i] += 1
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of integers where the value at index `i` is the frequency of `i` in `arr`, `i` is the last element in `arr`.
    cou = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if freq[i] >= 2:
            continue
        
        if freq[i] == 1:
            cou += 1
        
        if cou == 2 or freq[i] == 0:
            print(i)
            break
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of integers where the value at index `i` is the frequency of `i` in `arr`, `i` is `n`, `n` is the length of `arr`, `cou` is the number of elements in `arr` that appear only once.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of non-negative integers as input and prints the first integer that appears only once in the list, or the first integer that does not appear in the list at all. If no such integer is found, it prints the last integer in the list. The function also counts the number of elements that appear only once in the list.
