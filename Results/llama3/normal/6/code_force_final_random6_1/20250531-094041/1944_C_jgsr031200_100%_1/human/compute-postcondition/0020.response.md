Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of integers where the value at index `i` is the frequency of `i` in `arr`, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0. If the frequency of the current element `i` in `arr` is exactly 1, then the current value of `cou` is 2. Otherwise, the current value of `freq[i]` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If neither of these conditions is met, the code inside the if statement is skipped and the next iteration of the loop is executed.***
