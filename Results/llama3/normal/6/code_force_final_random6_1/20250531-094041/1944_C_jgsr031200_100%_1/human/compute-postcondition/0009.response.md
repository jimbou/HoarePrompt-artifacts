The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of integers where the value at index `i` is the frequency of `i` in `arr`, `i` is the last element in `arr`, and `cou` is 0. These states do not ensure that the loop will execute, so they need to be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to 0 and `i` is now 0.

State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of integers where the value at index `i` is the frequency of `i` in `arr`, `i` is 0, `cou` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0**
