Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of integers where the value at index `i` is the frequency of `i` in `arr`, `i` is 0, `cou` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0. If the frequency of the current element `i` in `arr` is greater than or equal to 2, the rest of the code inside the current loop or if statement is skipped and the next iteration of the loop is executed. Otherwise, the code inside the if statement is executed.***
