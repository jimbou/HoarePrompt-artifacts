Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of integers where the value at index `i` is the frequency of `i` in `arr`, `i` is the last element in `arr`, `cou` is 0.**

In this output state, the code has introduced a new variable `cou` and assigned it the value 0. The values of the other variables, `arr`, `freq`, and `i`, remain unchanged. The precondition that `arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of integers where the value at index `i` is the frequency of `i` in `arr`, and `i` is the last element in `arr` is still valid after the code has been executed.
