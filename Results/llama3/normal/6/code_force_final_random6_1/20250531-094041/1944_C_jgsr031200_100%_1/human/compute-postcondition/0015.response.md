Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of integers where the value at index `i` is the frequency of `i` in `arr`, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0. If the frequency of the current element `i` in `arr` is exactly 1, then `cou` is 1. Otherwise, the code inside the if statement is skipped and the next iteration of the loop is executed.***
