Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of integers where the value at index `i` is the frequency of `i` in `arr`, `i` is the last element in `arr`, `cou` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n + 1):
    if freq[i] >= 2:
        continue
    if freq[i] == 1:
        cou += 1
    if cou == 2 or freq[i] == 0:
        print(i)
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of integers where the value at index `i` is the frequency of `i` in `arr`, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0. If the frequency of the current element `i` in `arr` is exactly 1, then the current value of `cou` is 2. Otherwise, the current value of `freq[i]` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If neither of these conditions is met, the code inside the if statement is skipped and the next iteration of the loop is executed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of integers where the value at index `i` is the frequency of `i` in `arr`, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1. If `cou` equals 2 or the frequency of `i` in `arr` is 0, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement and the value of `i` which is 1 is being printed. Otherwise, no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of integers where the value at index `i` is the frequency of `i` in `arr`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2. If the frequency of `i` in `arr` is 1, `cou` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the program does nothing. If `cou` equals 2 or `freq[i]` equals 0, the value of `i` which is 2 is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
