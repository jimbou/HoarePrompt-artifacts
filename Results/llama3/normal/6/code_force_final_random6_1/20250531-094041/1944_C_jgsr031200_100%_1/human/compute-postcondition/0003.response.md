The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `arr`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr`. If `arr` has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least 1 element, `freq` is a list of integers where the value at index `i` (which is the first element in `arr`) is 1 and all other values are 0, `i` is the first element in `arr`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the `i` is the second element in the `arr`.
State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, `freq` is a list of integers where the value at index `i` (which is the first element in `arr`) is 1 and all other values are 0, `i` is the second element in `arr`**
