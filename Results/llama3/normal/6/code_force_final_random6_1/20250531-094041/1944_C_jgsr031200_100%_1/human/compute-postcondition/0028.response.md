Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of integers where the value at index `i` is the frequency of `i` in `arr`, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and the value of `i` which is 1 is being printed.**

In this output state, the values of `arr`, `freq`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the value of `i` which is 1 is being printed.
