Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the game's final score if both players play optimally. The program first counts the frequency of each number in the array. Then, it iterates through the numbers from 0 to n (the size of the array) and checks if the frequency of the current number is 1 or 0. If the frequency is 1, it increments a counter. If the frequency is 0 or the counter is 2, it prints the current number and breaks the loop. This is because the game's final score is the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array or occurs only once.

Correctness: **True**
