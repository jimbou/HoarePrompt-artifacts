Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of integers where the value at index `i` is the frequency of `i` in `arr`, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0. If the frequency of the current element `i` in `arr` is exactly 1, then the current value of `cou` is 2. Otherwise, the current value of `freq[i]` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `arr`, `freq`, `i`, and `n` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `cou` is still dependent on the frequency of the current element `i` in `arr`. However, since the `break` statement is executed, we exit the most internal loop or if statement, which means that the current iteration or condition is terminated.
