Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the game's final score if both players play optimally.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It first reads the input array `arr` and creates a frequency array `freq` to store the frequency of each element in `arr`.

2. It then iterates over the frequency array `freq` from index 0 to `n` (where `n` is the length of `arr`). For each index `i`, it checks if the frequency of `i` is greater than or equal to 2. If it is, it skips to the next iteration.

3. If the frequency of `i` is 1, it increments a counter `cou` by 1.

4. If `cou` becomes 2 or if the frequency of `i` is 0, it prints the current index `i` and breaks out of the loop.

The program's logic is correct because it correctly identifies the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array `c` (which is the MEX of `c`). The MEX of `c` is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in `c`, which is the same as the smallest non-negative integer that is not in `arr` and has a frequency of 1 in `arr`.

The program's time complexity is O(n) and its space complexity is also O(n), where n is the length of the input array `arr`.

Correctness: **True**
