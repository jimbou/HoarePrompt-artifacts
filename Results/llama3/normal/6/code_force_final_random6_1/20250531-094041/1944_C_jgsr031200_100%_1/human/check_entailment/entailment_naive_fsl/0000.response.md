Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the game's logic and finds the final score if both players play optimally. The program first counts the frequency of each number in the array, then iterates through the numbers from 0 to n. If a number has a frequency of 1, it increments a counter. If the counter reaches 2 or the frequency of a number is 0, it prints the current number as the final score.

The program's logic is correct because it takes into account the fact that Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to minimize it. By counting the frequency of each number and iterating through the numbers, the program can determine the optimal strategy for both players.

The program also handles edge cases correctly. For example, if the input array is empty, the program will print 0 as the final score, which is correct. If the input array contains only one element, the program will print 0 as the final score, which is also correct.

Overall, the program is correct and will produce the correct output for all possible inputs.
