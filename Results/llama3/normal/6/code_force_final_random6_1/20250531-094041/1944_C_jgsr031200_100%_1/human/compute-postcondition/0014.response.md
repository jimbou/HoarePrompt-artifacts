Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of integers where the value at index `i` is the frequency of `i` in `arr`, `i` is 0, `cou` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0. The frequency of the current element `i` in `arr` is exactly 1.**

In this output state, the value of `cou` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `cou` being 1. The other variables remain unchanged, with `arr` still being a list of non-negative integers, `freq` still representing the frequency of each element in `arr`, `i` still being 0, and `n` still being greater than or equal to 0. Additionally, the frequency of the current element `i` in `arr` is still exactly 1.
