Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a list of integers where the value at index `i` is the frequency of `i` in `arr`, `i` is the last element in `arr`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the `freq` list will contain the frequency of each integer in the `arr` list, and the variable `i` will hold the value of the last element in `arr`. The `arr` list remains unchanged.
