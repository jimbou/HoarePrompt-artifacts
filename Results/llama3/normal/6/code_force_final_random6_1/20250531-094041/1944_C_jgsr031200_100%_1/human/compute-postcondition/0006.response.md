The value of `freq[i]` is incremented by 1. Since `i` is the third element in `arr`, the value at index `i` in `freq` is initially 0. Therefore, the value at index `i` in `freq` is now 1. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 3 elements, `freq` is a list of integers where the value at index `i` (which is the third element in `arr`) is 1 and all other values are as before, `i` is the third element in `arr`.**
