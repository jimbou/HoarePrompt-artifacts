Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is 0, `k` is at least 3, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n*(n-1)` modulo `M`, `s` is 2*c * a + 2*c * i * c * m + 2*c * a, `a` is the original value of `a` plus the sum of all `f` values, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `i` is 2, stdin contains no more test cases**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s` has been updated to include an additional term `c * i * c * m + c * a`, which is added to its original value. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.
