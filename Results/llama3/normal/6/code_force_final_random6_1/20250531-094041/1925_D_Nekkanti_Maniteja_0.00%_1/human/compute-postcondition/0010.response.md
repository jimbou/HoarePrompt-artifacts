Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is 0, `k` is at least 1, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n*(n-1)` modulo `M`, `s` is `c * a`, `a` is the original value of `a` plus the sum of all `f` values, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `i` is 0, stdin contains no more test cases**

The value of `s` is updated to be the sum of its original value and the product of `c`, `i`, `c`, and `m`, and the product of `c` and `a`. Since `i` is 0 and `m` is 0, the first product is 0, and the value of `s` becomes `c * a`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
