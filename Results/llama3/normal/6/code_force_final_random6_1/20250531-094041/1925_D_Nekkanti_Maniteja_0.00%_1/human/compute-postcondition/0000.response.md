The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains multiple test cases does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is now 0 and stdin contains at least 1 test case.
State: **stdin contains at least 1 test case, `i` is 0**
