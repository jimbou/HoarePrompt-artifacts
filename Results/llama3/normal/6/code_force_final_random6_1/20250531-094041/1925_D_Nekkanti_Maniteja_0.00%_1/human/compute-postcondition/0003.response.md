Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer and must be greater than 0, k is an integer, M is 1000000007, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n*(n-1) modulo M, s is 0, a is the original value of a plus f, i is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `a` is incremented by the value of `f`, which is one of the inputs from stdin. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by one as one test case is consumed by the `input()` function.
