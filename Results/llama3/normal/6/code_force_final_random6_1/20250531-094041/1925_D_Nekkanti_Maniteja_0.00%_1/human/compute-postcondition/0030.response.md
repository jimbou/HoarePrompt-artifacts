Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is at least 2, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n*(n-1)` modulo `M`, `s` is `c * a + c * m * c * 0 + c * i * c * m + c * a`, `a` is the original value of `a` plus `m` times `f`, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `i` is 1, stdin contains no more inputs.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s` has been updated to include additional terms, specifically `c * i * c * m` and another `c * a`, while all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `s` can now be expressed as the sum of four terms: `c * a`, `c * m * c * 0`, `c * i * c * m`, and `c * a`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c`, `a`, `u`, `v`, `f`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state, and there are no more inputs in stdin.
