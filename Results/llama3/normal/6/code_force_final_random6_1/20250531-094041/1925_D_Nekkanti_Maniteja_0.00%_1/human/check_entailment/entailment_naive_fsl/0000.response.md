Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The issue lies in the line where the sum `s` is calculated. The correct formula for the expected value should be the sum of the probabilities of each pair being chosen multiplied by their friendship value, plus the sum of the probabilities of each pair being chosen multiplied by the number of times they are chosen. However, the program incorrectly calculates this by multiplying the probability of a pair being chosen by the total number of pairs and the total number of excursions, which is not correct.

A correct implementation would involve calculating the probability of each pair being chosen and then summing up these probabilities multiplied by their friendship values. This would require a different approach than the one used in the provided program.

For example, consider the case where there are 3 children, 2 pairs of friends, and 2 excursions. The pairs have friendship values of 1 and 2, respectively. The program would calculate the sum `s` as `c * 0 * c * 2 + c * 3`, which is incorrect. The correct calculation would involve calculating the probability of each pair being chosen and then summing up these probabilities multiplied by their friendship values.
