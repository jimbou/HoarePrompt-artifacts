Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer and must be greater than 2, k is an integer, M is 1000000007, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n*(n-1) modulo M, s is 0, a is the original value of a plus 2f plus the original value of f, u is an integer, v is an integer, f is an integer, i is 2, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 3**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line reads three integers from stdin and assigns them to u, v, and f, respectively. This reduces the number of test cases in stdin by 1. The second line increments a by the value of f. Since a was originally the sum of the original value of a, f, and the original value of f, adding f again makes a equal to the original value of a plus 2f plus the original value of f. No other variables are affected.
