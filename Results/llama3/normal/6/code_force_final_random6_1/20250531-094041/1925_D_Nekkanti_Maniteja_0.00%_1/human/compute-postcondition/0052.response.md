The code prints the value of `s` modulo `M`. Where `s` is the value of `k * c * a + c * m * (k * (k-1) / 2)`, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n*(n-1)` modulo `M`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `M` is 1000000007, `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer.

Output: **(k * c * a + c * m * (k * (k-1) / 2)) % 1000000007 (where a is the sum of all f values, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n*(n-1) modulo 1000000007, k is an integer greater than or equal to 0, m is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, f is an integer)**
