To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `k`. The loop will execute if `k` is at least 1. Since `i` is currently `m-1`, we need to adjust it to be 0, which is the starting value of the range.

State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is at least 1, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n*(n-1)` modulo `M`, `s` is 0, `a` is the original value of `a` plus `m` times `f`, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `i` is 0, stdin contains no more inputs.**
