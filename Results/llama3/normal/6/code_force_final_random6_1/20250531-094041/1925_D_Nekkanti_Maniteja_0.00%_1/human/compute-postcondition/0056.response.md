Functionality: This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, each containing an integer k, followed by k lines of three integers (n, m, k), and then m lines of three integers (a_i, b_i, f_i). It calculates the sum of all f_i values and uses this sum, along with the values of n, m, and k, to compute a result s. The function then prints the remainder of s divided by a large modulus M (1000000007) for each test case.
