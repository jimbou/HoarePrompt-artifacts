Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than 1, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n*(n-1)` modulo `M`, `s` is `c * a + c * i * c * m + c * a`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `i` is 1, `stdin` is empty**

The value of `s` has been updated to include the additional terms `c * i * c * m` and `c * a`, where `i` is 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
