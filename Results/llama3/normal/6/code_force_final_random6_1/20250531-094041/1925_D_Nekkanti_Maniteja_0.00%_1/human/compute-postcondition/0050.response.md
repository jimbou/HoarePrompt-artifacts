Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than 2, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n*(n-1)` modulo `M`, `s` is 2*c * i * c * m + 2*c * a, `a` is the sum of all `f` values, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `i` is 2, `stdin` is empty**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to `2*c * i * c * m + 2*c * a`, which is the result of adding `c * i * c * m + c * a` to the original value of `s`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
