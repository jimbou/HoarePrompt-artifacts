Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer and must be greater than 1, k is an integer, M is 1000000007, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n*(n-1) modulo M, s is 0, a is the original value of a plus f plus the original value of f, u is an integer, v is an integer, f is an integer, i is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `a` is updated by adding the value of `f` to its original value plus the original value of `f`. The variables `u`, `v`, and `f` are assigned integer values from the input. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 1.
