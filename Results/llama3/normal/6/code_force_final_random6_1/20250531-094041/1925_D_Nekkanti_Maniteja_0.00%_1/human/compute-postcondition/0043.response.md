Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer greater than 2, k is an integer, M is 1000000007, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n*(n-1) modulo M, s is 0, a is f plus the original value of f plus the new value of f, u is an integer, v is an integer, f is an integer, i is 2, stdin is empty**

The code first reads three integers from stdin and assigns them to u, v, and f. Since stdin was empty, this operation does not change the state of stdin. The second line increments a by the value of f. Since a was initially f plus the original value of f, it now becomes f plus the original value of f plus the new value of f. No other variables are affected.
