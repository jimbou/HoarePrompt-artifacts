Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer and must be 0, k is an integer, M is 1000000007, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n*(n-1) modulo M, s is 0, a is the original value of a plus the sum of all f values, u is an integer, v is an integer, f is an integer, i is m, stdin contains no more test cases.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for n, k, M, and c as in the initial state. The value of m will be 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The value of a will be the original value plus the sum of all f values read from the input during the loop iterations. The values of u, v, and f will be the last values read from the input. The value of i will be equal to the original value of m, indicating the number of iterations the loop has executed. The stdin will contain no more test cases.
