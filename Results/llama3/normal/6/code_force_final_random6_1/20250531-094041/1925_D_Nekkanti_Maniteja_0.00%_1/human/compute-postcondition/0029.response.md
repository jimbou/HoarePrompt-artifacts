The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `k` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute again `k` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is at least 2, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n*(n-1)` modulo `M`, `s` is `c * a + c * m * c * 0`, `a` is the original value of `a` plus `m` times `f`, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `i` is 1, stdin contains no more inputs.**
