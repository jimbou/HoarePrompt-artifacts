Output: **`n` is an integer, `m` is 0, `k` is at least `k`, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n*(n-1)` modulo `M`, `s` is `k*c * a + k*(k-1)/2*c * c * m`, `a` is the original value of `a` plus the sum of all `f` values, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `i` is `k-1`, stdin contains no more test cases, and the value of `s` modulo `M` is being printed.**
