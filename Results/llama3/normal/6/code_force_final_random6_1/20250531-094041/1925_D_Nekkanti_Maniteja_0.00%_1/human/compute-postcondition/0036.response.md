State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is 0, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n*(n-1)` modulo `M`, `s` is `c * a * k + c^2 * m * k * (k - 1) / 2`, `a` is the original value of `a` plus `m` times `f`, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `i` is `m`, stdin contains no more inputs, and the remainder of `s` when divided by `M` is being printed**
