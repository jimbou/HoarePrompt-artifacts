Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is 0, `k` is at least 2, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n*(n-1)` modulo `M`, `s` is `c * a + c * i * c * m + c * a`, `a` is the original value of `a` plus the sum of all `f` values, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `i` is 1, stdin contains no more test cases**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to include the additional terms `c * i * c * m` and `c * a`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Note that since `m` is 0, the term `c * i * c * m` is also 0, so the update to `s` simplifies to `s = c * a + c * a = 2 * c * a`.
