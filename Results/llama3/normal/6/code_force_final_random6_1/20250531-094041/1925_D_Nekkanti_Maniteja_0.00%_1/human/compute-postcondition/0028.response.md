Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is at least 1, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n*(n-1)` modulo `M`, `s` is `c * a + c * m * c * 0`, `a` is the original value of `a` plus `m` times `f`, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `i` is 0, stdin contains no more inputs.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s` has been updated to be the sum of `c` times `a` and `c` times `m` times `c` times `i`, where `i` is 0. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
