The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line reads three integers from stdin and assigns them to `u`, `v`, and `f`, respectively. The second line increments `a` by the value of `f`.

Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer greater than 0, k is 0, M is 1000000007, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n*(n-1) modulo M, s is 0, a is the original value of a plus f, u is an integer, v is an integer, f is an integer, i is 1, stdin contains at least one test case minus one input**
