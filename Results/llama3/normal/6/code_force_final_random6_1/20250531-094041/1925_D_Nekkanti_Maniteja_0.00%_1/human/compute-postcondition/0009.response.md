To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `k`. The loop will execute if `k` is at least 1. Since `i` is initialized to `m`, which is 0, we can adjust `i` to be 0 and `k` to be at least 1.

State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is 0, `k` is at least 1, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n*(n-1)` modulo `M`, `s` is 0, `a` is the original value of `a` plus the sum of all `f` values, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `i` is 0, stdin contains no more test cases**
