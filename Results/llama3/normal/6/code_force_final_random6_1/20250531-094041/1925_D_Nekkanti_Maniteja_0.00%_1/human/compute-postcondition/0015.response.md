Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is 0, `k` is at least `k`, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n*(n-1)` modulo `M`, `s` is `k*c * a + k*(k-1)/2*c * c * m`, `a` is the original value of `a` plus the sum of all `f` values, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `i` is `k-1`, stdin contains no more test cases.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: The value of `n`, `M`, `c`, `a`, `u`, `v`, and `f` remain unchanged. The value of `m` is still 0. The value of `k` is at least `k`, meaning the loop has executed `k` times. The value of `s` is the sum of `k` times `c` times `a` plus the sum of the first `k-1` integers times `c` times `c` times `m`. The value of `i` is `k-1`, indicating the loop has finished executing.
