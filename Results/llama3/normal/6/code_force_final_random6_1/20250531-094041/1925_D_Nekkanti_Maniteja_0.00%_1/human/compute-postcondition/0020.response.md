To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `m`. The loop will execute if `m` is at least 1. Since `i` is initialized to `k` before the loop, we need to adjust `k` to be 0 (the starting value of `i` in the range) for the loop to start executing. 

State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `k` is 0, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n*(n-1)` modulo `M`, `s` is 0, `a` is 0, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `i` is 0, stdin contains at least one test case minus one input**
