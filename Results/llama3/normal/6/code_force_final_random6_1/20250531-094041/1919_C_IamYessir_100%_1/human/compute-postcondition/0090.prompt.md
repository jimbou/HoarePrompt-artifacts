Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, lit is a list of integers, a is an empty list, b is an empty list, cp is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if len(a) == 0:
        x = float('inf')
    else:
        x = a[-1]
    if len(b) == 0:
        y = float('inf')
    else:
        y = b[-1]
    if x > y:
        if y >= lit[i]:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
    elif x == y:
        a.append(lit[i])
    elif x < y:
        if x >= lit[i]:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If `b` is empty, `x` is infinity. Otherwise, `b` is a non-empty list, `y` is the last element of `b`. If `a` is empty, `x` is infinity. Otherwise, `a` is a list of integers and `x` is the last element of `a`. The value of `x` and `y` are compared and updated based on their values and the values in `lit`. If `x` is greater than `y`, then `y` is updated to the first element of `lit` if `y` is greater than or equal to the first element of `lit`, otherwise `x` is updated to the first element of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is greater than `y`. If `x` is less than or equal to `y`, then either `x` is updated to the last element of `a` which is equal to `lit[i]`, or `y` is updated to the last element of `b` which is equal to `lit[i]`, or `x` is updated to the first element of `lit` if `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, or `y` is updated to `lit[i]` if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `b` is a list of integers, `a` is either empty or a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If `x` > `y`, then if `y` is greater than or equal to the second element of `lit`, `b` contains the second element of `lit` and `y` is the last element of `b` which is the second element of `lit`. If `y` is less than the second element of `lit`, and the second element of `lit` is greater than `x`, `b` contains the second element of `lit` and `y` is the last element of `b` which is the second element of `lit`. If `y` is less than the second element of `lit`, and the second element of `lit` is less than or equal to `x`, and the second element of `lit` is greater than `y`, then the second element of `lit` is appended to `a`. If `b` is empty, `y` is infinity and `x` is the last element of `a`. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b` and `x` is either infinity or the last element of `a`. If `x` equals `y`, `a` contains one more element which is the second element of `lit` (at index 1). If `x` is less than `y`, then if `x` is greater than or equal to the second element of `lit`, `a` contains an extra element which is the second element of `lit`. If `x` is less than the second element of `lit`, `a` remains unchanged. If `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, `a` will have an additional element which is the second element of `lit`. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y`, and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, `b` will have an additional element equal to `lit[1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is greater than 2, i is 2, lit is a list of integers, cp is 0, b is a list of integers, a is either empty or a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If b is empty, y is infinity and x is the last element of a. Otherwise, y is the last element of b and x is either infinity or the last element of a. If x > y, then if y is greater than or equal to the second element of lit, b contains the second element of lit and y is the last element of b which is the second element of lit. If y is less than the second element of lit, and the second element of lit is greater than x, b contains the second element of lit and y is the last element of b which is the second element of lit. If y is less than the second element of lit, and the second element of lit is less than or equal to x, and the second element of lit is greater than y, then the second element of lit is appended to a. If x equals y, a contains one more element which is the second element of lit (at index 1). If x is less than y, then if x is greater than or equal to the second element of lit, a contains an extra element which is the second element of lit. If x is less than the second element of lit, a remains unchanged. If lit[i] is greater than y, a will have an additional element which is the second element of lit. If lit[i] is less than or equal to y, and lit[i] is greater than x, b will have an additional element equal to lit[1]. If y is greater than or equal to lit[i] and lit[i] is greater than x, b contains the element at index i of lit which is the third element of lit, y is the last element of b which is the third element of lit and x is either infinity or the last element of a.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
