To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is: `for i in range(1, len(b)):`

The objects in the loop head are `i` and `b`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `b`. If `i` is less than the length of `b`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `b` must have at least 3 elements.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. Additionally, `b` must still have at least 3 elements.

The other variables `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `a`, and `s` are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is 0, `i` is 3, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `b` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `a` is a list of integers, `s` is the number of times `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]` for all `i` in the range from 1 to the length of `a`.**
