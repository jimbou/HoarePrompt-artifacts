Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `b` is a list of integers, `a` is either empty or a list of integers with the second element of `lit` appended to it, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If `b` is empty, `y` is infinity and `x` is the last element of `a` which is the second element of `lit`. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b` and `x` is either infinity or the last element of `a` which is the second element of `lit`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n`, `cp`, `b`, and `lit` remains the same. The value of `i` is still 1. The list `a` now contains the second element of `lit` appended to it. The value of `x` and `y` depends on whether `b` is empty or not. If `b` is empty, `y` is infinity and `x` is the second element of `lit`. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b` and `x` is either infinity or the second element of `lit`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
