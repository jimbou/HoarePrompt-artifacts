Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `y` is the last element of `b`, `x` is either infinity or the last element of `a`, `b` is a non-empty list, `a` is either empty or a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been updated to be the last element of list `b`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that `x` is still either infinity or the last element of `a`, depending on whether `a` is empty or not. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
