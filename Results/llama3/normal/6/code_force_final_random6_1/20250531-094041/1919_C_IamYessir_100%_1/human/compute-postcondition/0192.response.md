Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `s` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list with its last two elements being the element of `lit` at index `i`, `y` is the last element of `b`, which is the element of `lit` at index `i`, and `x` is either the last element of `a` or positive infinity if `a` is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated by appending the element of `lit` at index `i` to it. As a result, `b` now has two elements, both of which are the element of `lit` at index `i`. The value of `y` has also been updated to be the last element of `b`, which is the element of `lit` at index `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.
