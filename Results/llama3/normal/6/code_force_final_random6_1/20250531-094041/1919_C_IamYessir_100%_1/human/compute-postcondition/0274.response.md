Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `s` is not defined. If the length of list `b` is 0, then `b` remains an empty list and `y` remains positive infinity. Otherwise, `b` is a list of integers with at least one element and `y` is the last element of `b`. If the length of list `a` is 0, then `a` remains an empty list and `x` remains positive infinity. Otherwise, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and `x` is an integer. Additionally, `x` is less than `y`. If `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, then `x` is the last element of `a`, `y` is the last element of `b` and is greater than `x`. If `x` is less than `lit[i]`, then either `lit[i]` is greater than `y` and the last element of `a` is `lit[i]`, or `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y` and greater than `x` and `y` is equal to `lit[i]`.***
