Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `s` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, and `b` is a non-empty list with its last element being the element of `lit` at index `i`. If `b` is empty, then `y` is positive infinity. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`, which is either the element of `lit` at index `i` or less than the element of `lit` at index `i`. If `a` is empty, then `x` is positive infinity. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `a`, which is either the element of `lit` at index `i` or positive infinity if `a` is empty. If `x` is equal to `y`, then `x` is the last element of `a`, which is the element of `lit` at index `i`. If `x` is less than `y`, then if `x` is greater than or equal to the element of `lit` at index `i`, the last element of `a` is the element of `lit` at index `i`. If `x` is less than the element of `lit` at index `i`, then either the last element of `a` is the element of `lit` at index `i` if the element of `lit` at index `i` is greater than `y`, or the last two elements of `b` are the element of `lit` at index `i` and `y` is the last element of `b`, which is the element of `lit` at index `i`, if the element of `lit` at index `i` is less than or equal to `y` and greater than `x`.***
