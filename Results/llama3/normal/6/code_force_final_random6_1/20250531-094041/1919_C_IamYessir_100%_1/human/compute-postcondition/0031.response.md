Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. `a` is a non-empty list, `x` is the last element of `a` which is equal to `lit[i]`, `b` is a non-empty list, `y` is the last element of `b`, `x` is less than `y`.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated by appending the current value of `lit[i]`, which is now the last element of `a` and also the value of `x`. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions regarding the relationship between `x` and `y` and the value of `x` compared to `lit[i]` are still valid.
