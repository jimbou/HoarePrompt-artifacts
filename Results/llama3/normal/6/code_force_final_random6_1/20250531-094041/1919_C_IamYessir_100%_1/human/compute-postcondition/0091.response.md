Output State: **`n` is 0, `i` is 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `b` is a list of integers, `a` is either empty or a list of integers, `s` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If `b` is empty, `y` is infinity and `x` is the last element of `a`. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b` and `x` is either infinity or the last element of `a`. The values of `x` and `y` are compared and updated based on their values and the values in `lit`. If `x` is greater than `y`, then `y` is updated to the last element of `lit` if `y` is greater than or equal to the last element of `lit`, otherwise `x` is updated to the last element of `lit` if the last element of `lit` is greater than `y`. If `x` is less than or equal to `y`, then either `x` is updated to the last element of `a` which is equal to the last element of `lit`, or `y` is updated to the last element of `b` which is equal to the last element of `lit`, or `x` is updated to the last element of `lit` if the last element of `lit` is greater than `y`, or `y` is updated to the last element of `lit` if `y` is greater than or equal to the last element of `lit` and the last element of `lit` is greater than `x`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `s` which is initialized to 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions for `x` and `y` are still valid.
