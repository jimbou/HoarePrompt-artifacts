You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for understanding the program state at the start of the for loop. You will be provided with the program state after the previous iteration, which you need to modify. You will also see the for loop statement. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 10, `i` is 3, `n` must be  greater than 3.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.


Example Answer:
The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 4 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 4.
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 4, `n` must be  greater than 4**

Example 2:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 0, students_list is a list of students that must have at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list, index is 1 
```
for index, student in enumerate(students_list):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.


Example Answer:
The only objects in the loop head are variables  index, students  and list  students_list, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the student_list.  If the list has at least 3 students the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, students_list has at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list, index is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 students and the index is 2 and student is the trird student in the list.
State: **`total` is 0, students_list is a list of students that must have at least 3 students, student is the third student in the list, index is 3**


Your Task:
State at the end of the previous iteration: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `s` is 0. If `x` is greater than `y`, then if `y` is greater than or equal to the element of `lit` at index `i`, `b` is a non-empty list and its last element is the element of `lit` at index `i`, `y` is the last element of `b` which is the element of `lit` at index `i`, `a` is a list of integers and `x` is the last element of `a` which is greater than `y`. If `y` is less than the element of `lit` at index `i`, then if the element of `lit` at index `i` is greater than `x`, `b` is a non-empty list and its last element is `lit[i]`, `y` is `lit[i]`, `a` is a list of integers, if `a` is empty then `x` is positive infinity, otherwise `a` is a non-empty list and `x` is the last element of `a`. The current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `y`. The value of `y` is less than the value of `lit` at index `i`. The value of `lit` at index `i` is greater than the current value of `x`. Otherwise, if `x` is greater than or equal to the value of `lit` at index `i` and the value of `lit` at index `i` is greater than `y`, then `a` is a list of integers with the last element being the same as the element of `lit` at index `i`, `b` is a non-empty list, `y` is the last element of `b`, and `x` is the last element of `a` which is also the element of `lit` at index `i`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `x` is less than or equal to `y`, then if `x` is equal to `y`, `a` is a list of integers where the last element is the first element of `lit`, `b` is a non-empty list and `y` is the last element of `b`, and `x` is equal to `y`. If `x` is less than `y`, then either `a` is a list of integers that includes the `i`-th element of `lit`, `x` is the last element of `a` which is the `i`-th element of `lit`, `b` is a non-empty list and `y` is the last element of `b`, and `x` is less than `y`; or one of the following conditions holds: (1) `a` is a list of integers where the last element is `lit[i]`, `b` is a non-empty list and `y` is the last element of `b`, `x` is the last element of `a` and is less than `y`, and `lit[i]` is greater than `y` and is the last element of `a`; (2) `b` is a non-empty list and its last element is `lit[i]`, `y` is `lit[i]`, `a` is a list of integers and `x` is the last element of `a`, `x` is less than `lit[i]`, `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y`, and `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`; (3) otherwise, the values of `x`, `y`, `a`, `b`, `lit`, `n`, `cp`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged. If `x` is not less than `y`, then the values of `x`, `y`, `a`, `b`, `lit`, `n`, `cp`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged.
```
for i in range(0, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.
