Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is an integer if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is positive infinity, `y` is an integer if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is positive infinity, and `s` is the number of times `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]` for `i` in the range from 1 to `len(a) - 1` plus one. The current value of `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been incremented by 1, indicating that the number of times `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]` has increased by one. All other variables remain unchanged.
