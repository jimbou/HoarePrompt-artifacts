Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (n) and then a list of n integers. The integer is a positive integer and does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    lit = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a, b = [], []
    cp = 0
    for i in range(0, n):
        if len(a) == 0:
            x = float('inf')
        else:
            x = a[-1]
        if len(b) == 0:
            y = float('inf')
        else:
            y = b[-1]
        if x > y:
            if y >= lit[i]:
                b.append(lit[i])
            elif lit[i] > x:
                b.append(lit[i])
            elif x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y:
                a.append(lit[i])
        elif x == y:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif x < y:
            if x >= lit[i]:
                a.append(lit[i])
            elif lit[i] > y:
                a.append(lit[i])
            elif y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x:
                b.append(lit[i])
    s = 0
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        if a[i] > a[i - 1]:
            s += 1
    for i in range(1, len(b)):
        if b[i] > b[i - 1]:
            s += 1
    print(s)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is 0, `i` is equal to the length of `b`, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `b` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `s` is the number of times `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]` for all `i` in the range from 1 to the length of `a` plus the number of times `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]` for all `i` in the range from 1 to the length of `b`, and the value of `s` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is equal to `len(b)`, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `x` is either the last element of `a` or positive infinity if `a` is empty, and `y` is either the last element of `b` or positive infinity if `b` is empty. `s` is equal to the number of times `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]` for `i` in the range from 1 to `len(a) - 1`, plus the number of times `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]` for `i` in the range from 1 to `len(b) - 1`, and the sum of the number of times each element in the list `a` is greater than its previous element, and the number of times each element in the list `b` is greater than its previous element is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is equal to `len(b)`, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `x` is an integer if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is positive infinity, `y` is an integer if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is positive infinity, and `s` is the number of times `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]` for `i` in the range from 1 to `len(a) - 1` and the number of times `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]` for `i` in the range from 1 to `len(b) - 1`, and the value of `s` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
