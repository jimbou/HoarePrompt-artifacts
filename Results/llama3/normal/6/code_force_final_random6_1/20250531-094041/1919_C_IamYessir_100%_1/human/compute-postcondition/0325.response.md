Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `x` is an integer if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is positive infinity, `y` is an integer if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is positive infinity, and `s` is not defined.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

* The value of `n` remains unchanged.
* The list `lit` remains unchanged.
* The value of `cp` remains unchanged.
* The value of `i` is equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has executed `n` times.
* The list `a` contains a sequence of integers, where each integer is either the last element of `a` before the if-else block or the element at index `i` in the list `lit`.
* The list `b` contains a sequence of integers, where each integer is either the last element of `b` before the if-else block or the element at index `i` in the list `lit`.
* The value of `x` is an integer if `a` is not empty, otherwise it is positive infinity.
* The value of `y` is an integer if `b` is not empty, otherwise it is positive infinity.
* The variable `s` remains undefined.

Note that the output state only describes the changes made to the variables within the loop head and body, and does not affect the state of other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop.
