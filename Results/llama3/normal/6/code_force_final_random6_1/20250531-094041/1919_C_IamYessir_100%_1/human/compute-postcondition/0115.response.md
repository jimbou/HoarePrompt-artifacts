Output: **`n` is 0, `i` is equal to the length of `b`, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `b` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `s` is the number of times `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]` for all `i` in the range from 1 to the length of `a` plus the number of times `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]` for all `i` in the range from 1 to the length of `b`, and the value of `s` is being printed**
