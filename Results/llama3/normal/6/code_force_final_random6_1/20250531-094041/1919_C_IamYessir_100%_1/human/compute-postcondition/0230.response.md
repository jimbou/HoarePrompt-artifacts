Output State: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is equal to `len(b)`, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `x` is either the last element of `a` or positive infinity if `a` is empty, and `y` is either the last element of `b` or positive infinity if `b` is empty. `s` is equal to the number of times `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]` for `i` in the range from 1 to `len(a) - 1`, plus the number of times `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]` for `i` in the range from 1 to `len(b) - 1`.

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to the length of list `b`, and the value of `s` will be the sum of the number of times `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]` for `i` in the range from 1 to `len(a) - 1` and the number of times `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]` for `i` in the range from 1 to `len(b) - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
