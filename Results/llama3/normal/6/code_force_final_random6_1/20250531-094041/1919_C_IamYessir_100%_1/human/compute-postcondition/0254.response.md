Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `s` is not defined. `b` is a list of integers with at least one element and `y` is the last element of `b`. `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and `x` is an integer. The current value of `x` is greater than or equal to the current value of `lit[i]`, and the current value of `lit[i]` is greater than the current value of `y`. Additionally, the current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `y`.**
