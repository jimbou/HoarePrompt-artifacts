Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If `b` is empty, `x` is infinity. Otherwise, `b` is a non-empty list, `y` is the last element of `b`. If `a` is empty, `x` is infinity. Otherwise, `a` is a list of integers and `x` is the last element of `a`. The value of `x` and `y` are compared and updated based on their values and the values in `lit`. If `x` is greater than `y`, then `y` is updated to the first element of `lit` if `y` is greater than or equal to the first element of `lit`, otherwise `x` is updated to the first element of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is greater than `y`. If `x` is less than or equal to `y`, then either `x` is updated to the last element of `a` which is equal to `lit[i]`, or `y` is updated to the last element of `b` which is equal to `lit[i]`, or `x` is updated to the first element of `lit` if `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, or `y` is updated to `lit[i]` if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`.***
