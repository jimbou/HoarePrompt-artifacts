According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers**
