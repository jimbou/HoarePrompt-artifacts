Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If `b` is empty, `x` is infinity. Otherwise, `b` is a non-empty list, `y` is the last element of `b`. If `a` is empty, `x` is infinity. Otherwise, `a` is a list of integers and `x` is the last element of `a`. The current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `y`. If `y` is greater than or equal to the first element of `lit`, then `y` is the first element of `lit`. If `y` is less than the first element of `lit`, then `y` is the first element of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is greater than `x`. Otherwise, `x` is the first element of `lit` if the first element of `lit` is greater than `y`.***
