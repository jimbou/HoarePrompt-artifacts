Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `b` is a list of integers with at least one element, `y` is the last element of `b` which is equal to the element at index `i` in the list `lit`, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `x` is an integer greater than `y`.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to include the element at index `i` from the list `lit`. The value of `y` has also been updated to be the last element of the updated list `b`, which is equal to the element at index `i` in the list `lit`. The other variables remain unchanged.
