Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `b` is a list of integers with an additional element equal to `lit[1]`, `a` is either empty or a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If `b` is empty, `y` is infinity and `x` is the last element of `a`. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b` which is `lit[1]` and `x` is either infinity or the last element of `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated by appending the element at index `i` (which is 1) of the list `lit`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `y` is now the last element of `b`, which is `lit[1]`, and the value of `x` is either infinity or the last element of `a`, depending on whether `a` is empty or not.
