Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `b` is a list of integers, `a` is either empty or a list of integers with an additional element which is the second element of `lit`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If `b` is empty, `y` is infinity and `x` is the last element of `a` which is the second element of `lit`. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b` and `x` is either infinity or the last element of `a` which is the second element of `lit`.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated by appending the second element of `lit` to it. The values of other variables remain the same. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. The relationship between `x` and `y` is also updated based on the new value of `a`.
