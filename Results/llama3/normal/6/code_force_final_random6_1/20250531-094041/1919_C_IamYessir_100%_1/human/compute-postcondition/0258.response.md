Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `b` is a list of integers with at least one element, `y` is the last element of `b`. If the length of list `a` is 0, then `a` remains an empty list and `x` remains positive infinity. Otherwise, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and `x` is an integer. If `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, then `y` is equal to the element at index `i` in the list `lit`. If `y` is less than `lit[i]`, then either `y` is updated to `lit[i]` if `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, or `a` is a list of integers with at least two elements, the last element of `a` is greater than `y` and less than or equal to `x`, and `x` is an integer. In all cases, the current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `y`.***
