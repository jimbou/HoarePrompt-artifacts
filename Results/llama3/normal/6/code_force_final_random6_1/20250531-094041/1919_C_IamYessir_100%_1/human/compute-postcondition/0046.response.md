Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `x` is the last element of `a`**.

The value of `x` is updated to be the last element of list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.
