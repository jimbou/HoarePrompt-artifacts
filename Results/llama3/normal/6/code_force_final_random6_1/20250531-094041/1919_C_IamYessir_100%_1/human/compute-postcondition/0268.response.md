Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and the last element of `a` is `lit[i]`, `x` is an integer and `x` is less than `y` and `x` is less than `lit[i]`, `b` is a list of integers with at least one element and `y` is the last element of `b` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to include the current value of `lit[i]`, which is greater than `y`. The other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `x` and `y` and `lit[i]` is still valid, and `x` is still less than `y` and `lit[i]`.
