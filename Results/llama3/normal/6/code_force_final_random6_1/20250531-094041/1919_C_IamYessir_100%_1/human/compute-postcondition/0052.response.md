Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `b` is a list of integers that contains the second element of `lit`, `a` is either empty or a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If `b` is empty, `y` is infinity and `x` is the last element of `a`. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b` which is the second element of `lit` and `x` is either infinity or the last element of `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still greater than 1, `i` is still 1, `lit` is still a list of integers, `cp` is still 0, `b` now contains the second element of `lit`, `a` is still either empty or a list of integers, and stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. The values of `y` and `x` depend on whether `b` is empty or not. If `b` is empty, `y` is infinity and `x` is the last element of `a`. Otherwise, `y` is the second element of `lit` and `x` is either infinity or the last element of `a`.
