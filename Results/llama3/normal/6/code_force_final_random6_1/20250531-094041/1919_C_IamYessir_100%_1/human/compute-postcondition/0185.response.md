Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `s` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, and `b` is a non-empty list with its last element being the element of `lit` at index `i`. If `b` is empty, then `y` is positive infinity. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`, which is either the element of `lit` at index `i` or less than the element of `lit` at index `i`. `x` is positive infinity.**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been updated to positive infinity, while the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to `x` and `y` are still valid, but since `x` is now positive infinity, the conditions that depend on the comparison between `x` and `y` are not applicable.
