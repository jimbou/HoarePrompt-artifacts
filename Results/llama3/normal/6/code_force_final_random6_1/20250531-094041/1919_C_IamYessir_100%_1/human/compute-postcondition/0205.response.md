Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `s` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, and `b` is a list with its last element being the element of `lit` at index `i`. If `a` is empty, then `x` is positive infinity. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `a`, which is either the element of `lit` at index `i` or positive infinity if `a` is empty. If `b` is empty, then `y` is positive infinity. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`, which is either the element of `lit` at index `i` or less than the element of `lit` at index `i`. If `x` equals `y`, then `a` and `b` have their last elements as the element of `lit` at index `i`. If `x` is less than `y`, then `a` has its last element as the element of `lit` at index `i` if `x` is greater than or equal to the element of `lit` at index `i` or if `x` is less than the element of `lit` at index `i` and the element of `lit` at index `i` is greater than `y`. Otherwise, `b` has its last two elements as the element of `lit` at index `i` if `y` is greater than or equal to the element of `lit` at index `i` and the element of `lit` at index `i` is greater than `x`.***
