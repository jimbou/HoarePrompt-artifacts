Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1. If the length of list `a` is 0, then `x` is positive infinity, `y` is positive infinity, `a` is an empty list, and `b` is either an empty list or a list of integers with at least one element. If the length of list `a` is not 0, then `x` is an integer and is the last element of `a`, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `b` is either an empty list and `y` is positive infinity, or `b` is a list of integers with at least one element and `y` is positive infinity.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been updated to positive infinity, regardless of the length of list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
