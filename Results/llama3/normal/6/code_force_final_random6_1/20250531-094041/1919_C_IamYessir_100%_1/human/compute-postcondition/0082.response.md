Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `b` is a list of integers, `a` is either empty or a list of integers and contains one more element which is the second element of `lit`, `y` is either infinity or the last element of `b`, `x` is either infinity or the last element of `a`. If `b` is empty, `y` is infinity and `x` is the last element of `a`. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b` and `x` is either infinity or the last element of `a`. stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to include one more element which is the second element of `lit`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The conditions related to `x` and `y` are still valid, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
