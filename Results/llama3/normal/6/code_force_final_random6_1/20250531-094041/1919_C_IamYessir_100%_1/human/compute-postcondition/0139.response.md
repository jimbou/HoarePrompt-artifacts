Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `s` is 0. If `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `b` is a non-empty list and its last element is `lit[i]`, `y` is `lit[i]`, `a` is a list of integers, if `a` is empty then `x` is positive infinity, otherwise `a` is a non-empty list and `x` is the last element of `a`. The current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `y`. The value of `y` is less than the value of `lit` at index `i`. The value of `lit` at index `i` is greater than the current value of `x`. Otherwise, if `x` is greater than or equal to the value of `lit` at index `i` and the value of `lit` at index `i` is greater than `y`, then `a` is a list of integers with the last element being the same as the element of `lit` at index `i`, `b` is a non-empty list, `y` is the last element of `b`, and `x` is the last element of `a` which is also the element of `lit` at index `i`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
