Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, then `a` is a non-empty list, `x` is the last element of `a` which is equal to `lit[i]`, `b` is a non-empty list, `y` is the last element of `b`, `x` is less than `y`. If `x` is less than `lit[i]`, then either `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, in which case `a` is a list of integers and its last element is `lit[0]`, `x` is `lit[0]`, `y` is the last element of `b`, `b` is a non-empty list, `x` is less than `y`, or `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, in which case `y` is equal to `lit[i]`.***
