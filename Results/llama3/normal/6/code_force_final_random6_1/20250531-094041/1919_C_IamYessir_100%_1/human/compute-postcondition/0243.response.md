Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `b` is an empty list, `y` is positive infinity, and `s` is not defined. If the length of list `a` is 0, then `a` remains an empty list and `x` remains positive infinity. Otherwise, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and `x` is an integer.**

The code `y = float('inf')` assigns the value of positive infinity to `y`. Since `y` was already positive infinity in the initial state, its value remains unchanged. The values of the other variables are not affected by this code. The stdin still contains no input.
