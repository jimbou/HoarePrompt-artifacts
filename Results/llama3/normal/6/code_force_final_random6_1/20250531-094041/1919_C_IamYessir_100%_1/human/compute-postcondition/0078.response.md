Postcondition: ***n is greater than 2, i is 2, lit is a list of integers, cp is 0, b is a list of integers, a is either empty or a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If b is empty, y is infinity and x is the last element of a. Otherwise, y is the last element of b and x is either infinity or the last element of a. If lit[i] is greater than x, b contains the second element of lit and y is the last element of b which is the second element of lit. If lit[i] is less than or equal to x, and x is greater than or equal to the second element of lit, and the second element of lit is greater than y, then a contains an extra element which is the second element of lit (at index 1).***
