Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `s` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list with its last two elements being the element of `lit` at index `i`, and `y` is the last element of `b`, which is the element of `lit` at index `i`. If `a` is empty, then `x` is positive infinity. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `a`, which is either the element of `lit` at index `i` or positive infinity if `a` is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to include the element of `lit` at index `i` as its last element. As a result, `y` is now the last element of `b`, which is the element of `lit` at index `i`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
