Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `b` is a list of integers, `a` is either empty or a list of integers and contains one more element which is the second element of `lit`, `y` is either infinity or the last element of `b` or the second element of `lit`, `x` is either infinity or the last element of `a` or the second element of `lit`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to include one more element which is the second element of `lit`. The values of `n`, `i`, `lit`, `cp`, `b`, `y`, and `x` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.
