Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `s` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a non-empty list with its last two elements being the element of `lit` at index `i`, and `y` is the last element of `b`, which is the element of `lit` at index `i`. If `a` is empty, then `x` is positive infinity. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `a`, which is either the element of `lit` at index `i` or positive infinity if `a` is empty.**

In this output state, the code has appended the element of `lit` at index `i` to the list `b`, making it a non-empty list with its last two elements being the same, which is the element of `lit` at index `i`. The value of `y` is now the last element of `b`, which is the element of `lit` at index `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.
