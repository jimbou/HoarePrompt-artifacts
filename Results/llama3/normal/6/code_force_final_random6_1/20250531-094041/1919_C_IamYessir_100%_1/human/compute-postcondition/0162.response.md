Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `s` is 0, `x` is the last element of `a` which is either the element of `lit` at index `i` or positive infinity if `a` is empty, `y` is the last element of `b` which is either the element of `lit` at index `i` or less than the element of `lit` at index `i`, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a non-empty list.**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been updated to be the last element of `a`, which is either the element of `lit` at index `i` or positive infinity if `a` is empty. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
