Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is 0, `i` is 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `b` is a list of integers, `a` is either empty or a list of integers, `s` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If `b` is empty, `y` is infinity and `x` is the last element of `a`. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b` and `x` is either infinity or the last element of `a`. The values of `x` and `y` are compared and updated based on their values and the values in `lit`. If `x` is greater than `y`, then `y` is updated to the last element of `lit` if `y` is greater than or equal to the last element of `lit`, otherwise `x` is updated to the last element of `lit` if the last element of `lit` is greater than `y`. If `x` is less than or equal to `y`, then either `x` is updated to the last element of `a` which is equal to the last element of `lit`, or `y` is updated to the last element of `b` which is equal to the last element of `lit`, or `x` is updated to the last element of `lit` if the last element of `lit` is greater than `y`, or `y` is updated to the last element of `lit` if `y` is greater than or equal to the last element of `lit` and the last element of `lit` is greater than `x`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    if a[i] > a[i - 1]:
        s += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is 0, `i` is 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `b` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `s` is 1 if `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, otherwise `s` is 0. stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If `b` is empty, `y` is infinity and `x` is the last element of `a`. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b` and `x` is either infinity or the last element of `a`. The values of `x` and `y` are compared and updated based on their values and the values in `lit`. If `x` is greater than `y`, then `y` is updated to the last element of `lit` if `y` is greater than or equal to the last element of `lit`, otherwise `x` is updated to the last element of `lit` if the last element of `lit` is greater than `y`. If `x` is less than or equal to `y`, then either `x` is updated to the last element of `a` which is equal to the last element of `lit`, or `y` is updated to the last element of `b` which is equal to the last element of `lit`, or `x` is updated to the last element of `lit` if the last element of `lit` is greater than `y`, or `y` is updated to the last element of `lit` if `y` is greater than or equal to the last element of `lit` and the last element of `lit` is greater than `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is 0, `i` is 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `b` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is 2, otherwise `s` is 1. stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If `b` is empty, `y` is infinity and `x` is the last element of `a`. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b` and `x` is either infinity or the last element of `a`. The values of `x` and `y` are compared and updated based on their values and the values in `lit`. If `x` is greater than `y`, then `y` is updated to the last element of `lit` if `y` is greater than or equal to the last element of `lit`, otherwise `x` is updated to the last element of `lit` if the last element of `lit` is greater than `y`. If `x` is less than or equal to `y`, then either `x` is updated to the last element of `a` which is equal to the last element of `lit`, or `y` is updated to the last element of `b` which is equal to the last element of `lit`, or `x` is updated to the last element of `lit` if the last element of `lit` is greater than `y`, or `y` is updated to the last element of `lit` if `y` is greater than or equal to the last element of `lit` and the last element of `lit` is greater than `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is 0, `i` is 3, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `b` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is 3, otherwise `s` is 2. stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If `b` is empty, `y` is infinity and `x` is the last element of `a`. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b` and `x` is either infinity or the last element of `a`. The values of `x` and `y` are compared and updated based on their values and the values in `lit`. If `x` is greater than `y`, then `y` is updated to the last element of `lit` if `y` is greater than or equal to the last element of `lit`, otherwise `x` is updated to the last element of `lit` if the last element of `lit` is greater than `y`. If `x` is less than or equal to `y`, then either `x` is updated to the last element of `a` which is equal to the last element of `lit`, or `y` is updated to the last element of `b` which is equal to the last element of `lit`, or `x` is updated to the last element of `lit` if the last element of `lit` is greater than `y`, or `y` is updated to the last element of `lit` if `y` is greater than or equal to the last element of `lit` and the last element of `lit` is greater than `x`. If `a[i]` is not greater than `a[i - 1]`, then the values of `x` and `y` are not updated.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
