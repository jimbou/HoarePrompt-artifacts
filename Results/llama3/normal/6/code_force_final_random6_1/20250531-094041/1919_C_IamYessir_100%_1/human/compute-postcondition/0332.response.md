Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `b` is a list of integers, `x` is an integer if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is positive infinity, `y` is an integer if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is positive infinity. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is 2. Otherwise, `s` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s` has been incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is now 2. Otherwise, `s` is now 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
