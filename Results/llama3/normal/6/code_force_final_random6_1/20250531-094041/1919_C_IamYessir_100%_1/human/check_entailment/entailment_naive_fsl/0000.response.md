Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, consider the input [3, 1, 4, 1, 5]. The program will split this into two subsequences [3, 4, 1, 5] and [1], but the optimal split is [3, 4, 5] and [1, 1] which has a lower penalty.

The issue with the program is that it makes decisions based on the last element of the subsequences, but it does not consider the overall optimal solution. It does not try to minimize the penalty by considering all possible splits of the array.

A correct solution would involve using dynamic programming to consider all possible splits of the array and choose the one that minimizes the penalty.
