Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, `y` is infinity, `x` is infinity, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.**

In this output state, the value of `y` is set to infinity, and the value of `x` is still infinity because `a` is empty. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.
