Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `s` is 0. If `b` is an empty list, then `y` is positive infinity. Otherwise, `b` is a non-empty list and `y` is the last element of `b`. If `a` is an empty list, then `x` is positive infinity. Otherwise, `a` is a list of integers and `x` is the last element of `a`. Additionally, `x` is less than or equal to `y` and `x` is not equal to `y`. The current value of `x` is less than `y`. `x` is less than `lit[i]`.***
