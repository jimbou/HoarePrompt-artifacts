Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `b` is a list of integers and contains the second element of `lit` at the end, `a` is either empty or a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If `b` is empty, `y` is infinity and `x` is the last element of `a`. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b` which is the second element of `lit` and `x` is either infinity or the last element of `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to include the second element of `lit` at the end. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The condition for `x` and `y` has also been updated based on the new value of `b`.
