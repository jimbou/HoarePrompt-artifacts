Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `s` is 0, `a` is a list of integers with its last element being the element of `lit` at index `i`, `b` is a list with its last element being the element of `lit` at index `i`, `x` is the last element of `a`, which is the element of `lit` at index `i`, and if `b` is empty, then `y` is positive infinity, otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`, which is either the element of `lit` at index `i` or less than the element of `lit` at index `i`.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated by appending the element of `lit` at index `i` to it. As a result, the last element of `a` is now the element of `lit` at index `i`, and `x` is equal to this last element. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
