Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `a` is either an empty list or a list containing one element which is the first element of `lit`, `x` is either positive infinity if `a` is empty or the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, `b` is a list of integers with at least one element, `y` is the last element of `b` which is either the last element of `b` before the append operation or the element at index `i` in the list `lit`. If the length of list `a` is 0, then `x` is positive infinity. If the length of list `a` is not 0, then `x` is the last element of `a`. If `x` is greater than `y`, then `y` is either equal to the element at index `i` in the list `lit` if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, or `y` is updated to `lit[i]` if `lit[i]` is greater than `x`. If `x` is not greater than `y`, then if `x` is equal to `y`, `a` is a list of integers with at least one or two elements and its last element is either the last element of `a` before the if else block or the first element of `lit`. If `x` is not equal to `y`, then if `x` is less than `y`, either `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `x` is the last element of `a`, `y` is the last element of `b` and is greater than `x`, or `x` is less than `lit[i]` and either `lit[i]` is greater than `y` and the last element of `a` is `lit[i]`, or `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y` and greater than `x` and `y` is equal to `lit[i]`.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows:

The value of `n` is still an integer greater than 2, and the list `lit` remains unchanged. The variable `cp` is still 0, and the value of `i` is still 2. The list `a` can be either empty or contain one element, which is the first element of `lit`. The value of `x` depends on the length of `a`: if `a` is empty, `x` is positive infinity; otherwise, `x` is the last element of `a`. The list `b` now has at least one element, and the value of `y` is the last element of `b`, which is either the last element of `b` before the append operation or the element at index `i` in the list `lit`. The relationship between `x` and `y` is still dependent on their values, and the list `b` has been updated to include the element at index `i` in the list `lit`.
