Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, lit is a list of integers, cp is 0, i is equal to len(b), a is an empty list, b is an empty list, x is positive infinity, y is positive infinity, and s is not defined. Stdin contains no input.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

After executing the code, the value of `n` remains an integer greater than or equal to 0. The list `lit` is now populated with a list of integers obtained from the input. The variable `cp` is still 0. The variable `i` is equal to the length of the list `b`, which is initially empty, so `i` is 0. The lists `a` and `b` are reset to empty lists. Since `a` is empty, the value of `x` is positive infinity. Similarly, since `b` is empty, the value of `y` is also positive infinity. The variable `s` is not defined in the output state because it was not assigned a value in the code. Finally, the standard input (stdin) is empty, as all inputs have been consumed by the code.
