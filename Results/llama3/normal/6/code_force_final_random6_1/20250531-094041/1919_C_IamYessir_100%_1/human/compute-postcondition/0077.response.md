Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `b` is a list of integers, `a` is either empty or a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If `b` is empty, `y` is infinity and `x` is the last element of `a`. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b` and `x` is either infinity or the last element of `a`. If `x` is greater than or equal to the second element of `lit` and the second element of `lit` is greater than `y`, `a` contains an extra element which is the second element of `lit` (at index 1).***
