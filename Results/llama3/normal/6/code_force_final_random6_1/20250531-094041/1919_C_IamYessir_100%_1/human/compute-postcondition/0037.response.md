Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `b` is a non-empty list, `y` is the last element of `b` which is equal to `lit[i]`, `x` is less than `lit[i]`, `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y` which is equal to `lit[i]`, `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` which is equal to `y`, `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to include the current element of `lit` at index `i`. The value of `y` has also been updated to be equal to the last element of `b`, which is now `lit[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions regarding the relationships between `x`, `y`, and `lit[i]` are still valid, with `x` being less than `lit[i]`, `lit[i]` being less than or equal to `y` (which is now equal to `lit[i]`), and `lit[i]` being greater than `x`.
