Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is either the last element of `a` or positive infinity if `a` is empty, and `y` is either the last element of `b` or positive infinity if `b` is empty. `s` is equal to the number of times `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]` for `i` in the range from 1 to `len(a) - 1` plus 1. The current value of `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `s` has been incremented by 1. This means that the number of times `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]` for `i` in the range from 1 to `len(a) - 1` has increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
