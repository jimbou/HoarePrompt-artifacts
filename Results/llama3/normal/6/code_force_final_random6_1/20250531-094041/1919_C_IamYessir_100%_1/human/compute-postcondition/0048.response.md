Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `y` is infinity, `b` is a non-empty list, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is the last element of `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been updated to infinity, while the values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The precondition that `y` is the last element of `b` is no longer valid, as `y` is now infinity. The precondition that `x` is the last element of `a` is still valid. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
