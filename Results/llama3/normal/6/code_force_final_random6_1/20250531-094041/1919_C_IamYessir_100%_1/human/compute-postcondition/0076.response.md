Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `b` is a list of integers, `a` is either empty or a list of integers and contains an extra element which is the second element of lit (at index 1), stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If `b` is empty, `y` is infinity and `x` is the last element of `a`. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b` and `x` is either infinity or the last element of `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to include an extra element which is the second element of `lit` (at index 1). The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to `x` and `y` are still valid, but the value of `a` has been updated.
