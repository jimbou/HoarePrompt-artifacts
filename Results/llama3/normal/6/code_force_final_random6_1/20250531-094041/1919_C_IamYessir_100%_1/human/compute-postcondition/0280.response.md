Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `x` is positive infinity, `y` is either positive infinity or the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, `a` is either an empty list or a list of integers with at least one element, `b` is either an empty list or a list of integers with at least one element.**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been updated to positive infinity, while the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to the lists `a` and `b`, as well as the variables `x` and `y`, are still valid as they were in the initial state.
