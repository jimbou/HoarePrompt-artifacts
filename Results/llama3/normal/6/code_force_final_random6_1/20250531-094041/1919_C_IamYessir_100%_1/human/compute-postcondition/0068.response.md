Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `b` is a list of integers, `a` is either empty or a list of integers, `x` is infinity, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If `y` > `x`, then if `y` is greater than or equal to the second element of `lit`, `b` contains the second element of `lit` and `y` is the last element of `b` which is the second element of `lit`. If `y` is less than the second element of `lit`, and the second element of `lit` is greater than `x`, `b` contains the second element of `lit` and `y` is the last element of `b` which is the second element of `lit`. If `y` is less than the second element of `lit`, and the second element of `lit` is less than or equal to `x`, and the second element of `lit` is greater than `y`, then the second element of `lit` is appended to `a`. If `b` is empty, `y` is infinity and `x` is the last element of `a`. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b` and `x` is either infinity or the last element of `a`. If `x` equals `y`, `a` contains one more element which is the second element of `lit` (at index 1). If `x` is less than `y`, then if `x` is greater than or equal to the second element of `lit`, `a` contains an extra element which is the second element of `lit`. If `x` is less than the second element of `lit`, `a` remains unchanged. If `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, `a` will have an additional element which is the second element of `lit`. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y`, and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, `b` will have an additional element equal to `lit[1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that `x` is now infinity. The relationships between the variables and the conditions on the lists `a` and `b` remain the same.
