Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `s` is 0. If `x` is greater than or equal to the value of `lit` at index `i` and the value of `lit` at index `i` is greater than `y`, then `a` is a list of integers with the last element being the same as the element of `lit` at index `i`, `b` is a non-empty list, `y` is the last element of `b`, and `x` is the last element of `a` which is also the element of `lit` at index `i`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
