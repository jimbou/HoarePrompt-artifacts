Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `s` is 0, `a` is a list of integers with the last element being the same as the element of `lit` at index `i`, `b` is a non-empty list, `y` is the last element of `b`, `x` is the last element of `a` which is also the element of `lit` at index `i`.**

In this output state, the value of `x` is still greater than or equal to the value of `lit` at index `i`, but now `x` is exactly equal to the value of `lit` at index `i` because `a` has been appended with the element of `lit` at index `i`. The value of `y` is still less than the value of `lit` at index `i`, which is now equal to `x`. The other variables remain unchanged.
