Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is equal to `len(b)`, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `x` is an integer if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is positive infinity, `y` is an integer if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is positive infinity, and `s` is the number of times `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]` for `i` in the range from 1 to `len(a) - 1` and the number of times `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]` for `i` in the range from 1 to `len(b) - 1`.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the variable `i`, which is now equal to the length of list `b`, and the variable `s`, which now includes the number of times `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]` for `i` in the range from 1 to `len(b) - 1`.
