Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list of integers and its last element is `lit[0]`, `x` is `lit[0]`, `y` is the last element of `b`, `b` is a non-empty list, `x` is less than `y`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to include the first element of `lit`, which is now the last element of `a`. The value of `x` has also been updated to be equal to the last element of `a`, which is `lit[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions regarding the relationship between `x` and `y`, and the relationship between `lit[i]` and `y` are still valid.
