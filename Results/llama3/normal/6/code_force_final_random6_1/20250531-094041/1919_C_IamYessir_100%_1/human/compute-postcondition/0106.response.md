Postcondition: ***`n` is 0, `i` is 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `b` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `a` is a list of integers. `s` is the number of times `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]` for all `i` in the range from 1 to the length of `a`. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged.***
