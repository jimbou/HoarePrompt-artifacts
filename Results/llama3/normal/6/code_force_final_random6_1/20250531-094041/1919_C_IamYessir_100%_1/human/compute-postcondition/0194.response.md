Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `s` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, and `b` is a list with its last element being the element of `lit` at index `i`. If `x` is greater than or equal to the element of `lit` at index `i` and the element of `lit` at index `i` is greater than `y`, then `a` is updated to have its last element as the element of `lit` at index `i`, and `x` is updated to be the last element of `a`, which is the element of `lit` at index `i`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `a`, `x`, `b`, or `y`.***
