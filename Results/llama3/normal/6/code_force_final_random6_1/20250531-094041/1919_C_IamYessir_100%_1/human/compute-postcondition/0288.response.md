Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1. If the length of list `a` is 0, then `x` is positive infinity, `y` is either positive infinity if `b` is empty, or `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, `a` is a list containing one element which is the first element of `lit`, and `b` is either an empty list or a list of integers with at least one element. If the length of list `a` is not 0, then `x` is an integer and is the last element of `a`, `a` is a list of integers with at least two elements, the last element of `a` is the element at index `i` in the list `lit`, `b` is either an empty list and `y` is positive infinity, or `b` is a list of integers with at least one element and `y` is the last element of `b`. If `x` is greater than `y`, then `y` is either equal to the element at index `i` in the list `lit` if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, or `y` is updated to `lit[i]` if `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, or `a` is a list of integers with at least two elements, the last element of `a` is greater than `y` and less than or equal to `x`, and `x` is an integer. If `x` is not greater than `y`, then if `x` is equal to `y`, `a` is a list of integers with at least two elements and its last element is the first element of `lit`, `b` is a list of integers with at least one element, `x` is an integer and is equal to `y` which is the last element of `b`. If `x` is not equal to `y`, then if `x` is less than `y`, either `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `x` is the last element of `a`, `y` is the last element of `b` and is greater than `x`, or `x` is less than `lit[i]` and either `lit[i]` is greater than `y` and the last element of `a` is `lit[i]`, or `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y` and greater than `x` and `y` is equal to `lit[i]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n`, `lit`, `cp`, and `i` remains the same. The list `a` now contains at least one element, which is the first element of `lit`. The value of `x` and `y` depends on the length of list `a` and the comparison between `x` and `y`. If the length of list `a` is 0, then `x` is positive infinity and `y` is either positive infinity or the last element of `b`. If the length of list `a` is not 0, then `x` is an integer and is the last element of `a`, and `y` is either positive infinity or the last element of `b`. The relationship between `x` and `y` also depends on the comparison between `x` and `y`, and the value of `lit[i]`.
