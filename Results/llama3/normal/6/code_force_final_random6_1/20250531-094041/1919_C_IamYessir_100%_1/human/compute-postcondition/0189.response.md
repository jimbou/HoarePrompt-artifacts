Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `s` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a non-empty list with its last element being the element of `lit` at index `i`, `y` is the last element of `b`, which is either the element of `lit` at index `i` or less than the element of `lit` at index `i`, and `x` is the last element of `a`, which is either the element of `lit` at index `i` or positive infinity if `a` is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been updated to be the last element of `b`, which is either the element of `lit` at index `i` or less than the element of `lit` at index `i`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
