Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `s` is not defined, `b` is a list of integers with at least one element and `y` is the last element of `b` which is equal to `lit[i]`, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and `x` is an integer, `x` is less than `y` and `x` is less than `lit[i]`. `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y`. The current value of `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and the current value of `lit[i]` is greater than `x`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n`, `cp`, `i`, and `s` remains the same. The list `b` now has at least one element which is the current value of `lit[i]` and `y` is updated to be equal to `lit[i]`. The list `a` and the value of `x` remains the same. The relationship between `x`, `y`, and `lit[i]` remains the same.
