To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0. Also, `i` is equal to `len(b)`, which is 0 since `b` is an empty list. For the loop to execute, `i` should be 0.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `x` is positive infinity, `y` is positive infinity, and `s` is not defined. Stdin contains no input.**
