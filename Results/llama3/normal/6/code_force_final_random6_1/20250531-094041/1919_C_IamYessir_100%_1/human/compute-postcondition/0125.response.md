Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `s` is 0, `y` is positive infinity. If `a` is an empty list, then `x` is positive infinity. Otherwise, `a` is a list of integers and `x` is the last element of `a`.**

In this output state, all the variables from the initial state remain unchanged, except for the addition of a new variable `y`, which is assigned the value of positive infinity. The conditions related to the list `a` and the variable `x` also remain the same, as they are not affected by the code.
