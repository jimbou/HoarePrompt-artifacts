Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer n and a list of n integers. It then processes the list of integers, splitting it into two lists a and b based on certain conditions. The function counts the number of times an element in list a is greater than its previous element, and the number of times an element in list b is greater than its previous element. Finally, it prints the total count of these occurrences for each test case.**
