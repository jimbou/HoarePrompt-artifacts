Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `b` is a list of integers with at least one element, `y` is the last element of `b`, and `s` is not defined. If the length of list `a` is 0, then `a` remains an empty list and `x` remains positive infinity. Otherwise, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and `x` is an integer.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been updated to be the last element of the list `b`. All other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions related to the list `a` and variable `x` are still applicable.
