Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `s` is 0, `a` is a list of integers that includes the `i`-th element of `lit`, `x` is the last element of `a` which is the `i`-th element of `lit`, `b` is a non-empty list and `y` is the last element of `b`. Additionally, `x` is less than `y` and `x` is greater than or equal to the `i`-th element of `lit`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n`, `cp`, `i`, `s` remains unchanged. The list `a` now includes the `i`-th element of `lit` and `x` is updated to be the last element of `a` which is the `i`-th element of `lit`. The list `b` and the value of `y` remains unchanged. The relationship between `x` and `y` and the relationship between `x` and the `i`-th element of `lit` remains valid.
