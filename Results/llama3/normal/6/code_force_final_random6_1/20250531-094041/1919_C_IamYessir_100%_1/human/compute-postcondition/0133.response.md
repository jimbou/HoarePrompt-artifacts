Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `s` is 0. `b` is a list, if `b` is empty then `y` is positive infinity, otherwise `b` is a non-empty list and `y` is the last element of `b`. `a` is a list of integers, if `a` is empty then `x` is positive infinity, otherwise `a` is a non-empty list and `x` is the last element of `a`. The current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `y`. The value of `y` is less than the value of `lit` at index `i`. The value of `lit` at index `i` is greater than the current value of `x`.***
