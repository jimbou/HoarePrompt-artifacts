Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `s` is 0, `b` is a non-empty list and its last element is `lit[i]`, `y` is `lit[i]`, `a` is a list of integers, if `a` is empty then `x` is positive infinity, otherwise `a` is a non-empty list and `x` is the last element of `a`. The current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `y`. The value of `y` is less than the value of `lit` at index `i`. The value of `lit` at index `i` is greater than the current value of `x`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n`, `cp`, `i`, `s` remains the same. The list `b` is no longer empty and its last element is the element of `lit` at index `i`. The value of `y` is now `lit[i]`. The list `a` and the value of `x` remain the same. The relationship between `x` and `y` is still the same, i.e., `x` is greater than `y`. Also, the relationship between `y` and the element of `lit` at index `i` is still the same, i.e., `y` is less than the element of `lit` at index `i`. However, this relationship is now contradictory because `y` is now equal to the element of `lit` at index `i`.
