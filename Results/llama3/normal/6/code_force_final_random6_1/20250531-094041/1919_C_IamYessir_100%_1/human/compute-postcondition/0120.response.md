Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `s` is 0, `x` is positive infinity, and the length of `a` is 0.**

In this output state, all the variables from the initial state remain unchanged, and a new variable `x` is introduced with a value of positive infinity.
