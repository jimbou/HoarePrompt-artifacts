Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `s` is 0, `b` is a non-empty list and its last element is the element of `lit` at index `i`, `y` is the last element of `b` which is the element of `lit` at index `i`, `a` is a list of integers and `x` is the last element of `a` which is greater than `y`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still greater than 0, `lit` is still a list of integers, `cp` is still 0, `i` is still 0, and `s` is still 0. The list `b` is no longer empty and its last element is the element of `lit` at index `i`. The value of `y` is now the last element of `b`, which is the element of `lit` at index `i`. The list `a` is still a list of integers and `x` is still the last element of `a`, but `x` is greater than `y`.
