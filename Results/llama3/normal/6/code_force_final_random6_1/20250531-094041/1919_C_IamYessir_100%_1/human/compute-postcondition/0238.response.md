Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `x` is positive infinity, `y` is positive infinity, and `s` is not defined. The length of list `a` is 0. Stdin contains no input.**

The code `x = float('inf')` assigns the value of positive infinity to `x`. Since `x` was already positive infinity in the initial state, its value does not change. The values of the other variables remain the same, and the stdin still contains no input.
