Postcondition: ***`n` is 0, `i` is 3, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `b` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `a` is a list of integers, if `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, `s` is the number of times `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]` for all `i` in the range from 1 to the length of `a` plus one. Otherwise, `s` remains the number of times `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]` for all `i` in the range from 1 to the length of `a`.***
