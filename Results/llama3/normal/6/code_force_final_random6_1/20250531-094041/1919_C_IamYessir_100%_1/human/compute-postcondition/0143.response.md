Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `s` is 0, `a` is a list of integers where the last element is the first element of `lit`, `b` is a non-empty list and `y` is the last element of `b`, `x` is the first element of `lit` and is equal to `y`.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to include the first element of `lit`. The values of `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `i`, `s`, `b`, `y`, and the relationship between `x` and `y` remain unchanged. The value of `x` is now equal to the first element of `lit`, which is also equal to `y`.
