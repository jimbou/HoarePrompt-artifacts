The code `a.append(lit[i])` adds the value of `lit[i]` to the end of the list `a`. Since `lit[i]` is greater than `y` and `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, the new last element of `a` is greater than `y` and less than or equal to `x`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `s` is not defined, `b` is a list of integers with at least one element and `y` is the last element of `b`, `a` is a list of integers with at least two elements, the last element of `a` is greater than `y` and less than or equal to `x`, and `x` is an integer.**
