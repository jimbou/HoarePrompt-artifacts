Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `x` is an integer if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is positive infinity, `y` is an integer if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is positive infinity, and `s` is 0.**

In this output state, all the variables from the initial state are still valid, and their values remain unchanged. The only change is that the variable `s` is now defined and has a value of 0.
