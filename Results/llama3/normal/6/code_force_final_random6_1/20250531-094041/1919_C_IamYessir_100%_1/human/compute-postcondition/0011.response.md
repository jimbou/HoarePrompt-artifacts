Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `b` is a non-empty list, `cp` is 0, `y` is the last element of `b`, If `a` is empty, `x` is infinity. Otherwise, `a` is a list of integers and `x` is the last element of `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still greater than 0, `i` is still 0, `lit` is still a list of integers, `b` is still a non-empty list, `cp` is still 0. A new variable `y` is introduced and is assigned the value of the last element of `b`. The value of `a` and `x` remains the same, if `a` is empty then `x` is infinity otherwise `a` is a list of integers and `x` is the last element of `a`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.
