Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers and is not empty, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, `x` is the last element of `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers**

In this output state, the value of `x` is assigned the last element of the list `a`, which is not empty. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.
