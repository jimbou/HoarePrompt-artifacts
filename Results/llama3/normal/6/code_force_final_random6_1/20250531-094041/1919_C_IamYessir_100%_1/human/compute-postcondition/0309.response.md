Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `b` is a list of integers with at least one element, `y` is the last element of `b` which is the element at index `i` in the list `lit`, `a` is either an empty list or a list containing one element which is the first element of `lit`, or `a` is a list of integers with at least one or two elements, the last element of `a` is either the last element of `a` before the if else block or the element at index `i` in the list `lit`, `x` is either positive infinity if `a` is empty or the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty.**

In natural language, the output state is that the list `b` has been appended with the element at index `i` in the list `lit`, and the value of `y` has been updated to be the last element of `b`, which is the element at index `i` in the list `lit`. The other variables remain unchanged.
