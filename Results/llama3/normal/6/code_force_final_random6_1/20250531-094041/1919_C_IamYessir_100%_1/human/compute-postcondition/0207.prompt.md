Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than 0, lit is a list of integers, a is an empty list, b is an empty list, cp is 0, i is 0, s is the number of times a[i] is greater than a[i - 1] for all i in the range from 1 to the length of a plus the number of times b[i] is greater than b[i - 1] for all i in the range from 1 to the length of b
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if len(a) == 0:
        x = float('inf')
    else:
        x = a[-1]
    if len(b) == 0:
        y = float('inf')
    else:
        y = b[-1]
    if x > y:
        if y >= lit[i]:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
    elif x == y:
        a.append(lit[i])
    elif x < y:
        if x >= lit[i]:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `s` is 0. If `x` is greater than `y`, then if `y` is greater than or equal to the element of `lit` at index `i`, `b` is a non-empty list and its last element is the element of `lit` at index `i`, `y` is the last element of `b` which is the element of `lit` at index `i`, `a` is a list of integers and `x` is the last element of `a` which is greater than `y`. If `y` is less than the element of `lit` at index `i`, then if the element of `lit` at index `i` is greater than `x`, `b` is a non-empty list and its last element is `lit[i]`, `y` is `lit[i]`, `a` is a list of integers, if `a` is empty then `x` is positive infinity, otherwise `a` is a non-empty list and `x` is the last element of `a`. The current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `y`. The value of `y` is less than the value of `lit` at index `i`. The value of `lit` at index `i` is greater than the current value of `x`. Otherwise, if `x` is greater than or equal to the value of `lit` at index `i` and the value of `lit` at index `i` is greater than `y`, then `a` is a list of integers with the last element being the same as the element of `lit` at index `i`, `b` is a non-empty list, `y` is the last element of `b`, and `x` is the last element of `a` which is also the element of `lit` at index `i`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `x` is less than or equal to `y`, then if `x` is equal to `y`, `a` is a list of integers where the last element is the first element of `lit`, `b` is a non-empty list and `y` is the last element of `b`, and `x` is equal to `y`. If `x` is less than `y`, then either `a` is a list of integers that includes the `i`-th element of `lit`, `x` is the last element of `a` which is the `i`-th element of `lit`, `b` is a non-empty list and `y` is the last element of `b`, and `x` is less than `y`; or one of the following conditions holds: (1) `a` is a list of integers where the last element is `lit[i]`, `b` is a non-empty list and `y` is the last element of `b`, `x` is the last element of `a` and is less than `y`, and `lit[i]` is greater than `y` and is the last element of `a`; (2) `b` is a non-empty list and its last element is `lit[i]`, `y` is `lit[i]`, `a` is a list of integers and `x` is the last element of `a`, `x` is less than `lit[i]`, `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y`, and `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`; (3) otherwise, the values of `x`, `y`, `a`, `b`, `lit`, `n`, `cp`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged. If `x` is not less than `y`, then the values of `x`, `y`, `a`, `b`, `lit`, `n`, `cp`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `s` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, and `b` is a non-empty list with its last element being the element of `lit` at index `i`. If `b` is empty, then `y` is positive infinity. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`, which is either the element of `lit` at index `i` or less than the element of `lit` at index `i`. If `a` is empty, then `x` is positive infinity. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `a`, which is either the element of `lit` at index `i` or positive infinity if `a` is empty. If `x` is greater than `y`, then if `y` is greater than or equal to the element of `lit` at index `i`, `a` is a list of integers and `b` is a non-empty list with its last two elements being the element of `lit` at index `i`. If `y` is less than the element of `lit` at index `i`, then if `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, `b` is a non-empty list with its last two elements being the element of `lit` at index `i`, and `y` is the last element of `b`, which is the element of `lit` at index `i`. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x`, then if `x` is greater than or equal to the element of `lit` at index `i` and the element of `lit` at index `i` is greater than `y`, then `a` is a list of integers with its last element being the element of `lit` at index `i`, and `b` is a non-empty list with its last element being the element of `lit` at index `i`. Otherwise, `a` and `b` remain unchanged. If `x` is less than or equal to `y`, then if `x` is equal to `y`, `x` is the last element of `a`, which is the element of `lit` at index `i`. If `x` is less than `y`, then if `x` is greater than or equal to the element of `lit` at index `i`, the last element of `a` is the element of `lit` at index `i`. If `x` is less than the element of `lit` at index `i`, then either the last element of `a` is the element of `lit` at index `i` if the element of `lit` at index `i` is greater than `y`, or the last two elements of `b` are the element of `lit` at index `i` and `y` is the last element of `b`, which is the element of `lit` at index `i`, if the element of `lit` at index `i` is less than or equal to `y` and greater than `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `s` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, and `b` is a list with its last element being the element of `lit` at index `i`. If `x` is greater than `y`, then if `y` is greater than or equal to the element of `lit` at index `i`, `b` is updated to have its last two elements as the element of `lit` at index `i`, and `y` is updated to be the last element of `b`, which is the element of `lit` at index `i`. If `y` is less than the element of `lit` at index `i`, then if `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, `b` is updated to have its last two elements as the element of `lit` at index `i`, and `y` is updated to be the last element of `b`, which is the element of `lit` at index `i`. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x`, then if `x` is greater than or equal to the element of `lit` at index `i` and the element of `lit` at index `i` is greater than `y`, `a` is updated to have its last element as the element of `lit` at index `i`, and `x` is updated to be the last element of `a`, which is the element of `lit` at index `i`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `a`, `x`, `b`, or `y`. If `x` is not greater than `y`, then if `a` is empty, `x` is positive infinity. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `a`, which is either the element of `lit` at index `i` or positive infinity if `a` is empty. If `b` is empty, then `y` is positive infinity. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`, which is either the element of `lit` at index `i` or less than the element of `lit` at index `i`. If `x` equals `y`, then `a` and `b` have their last elements as the element of `lit` at index `i`. If `x` is less than `y`, then `a` has its last element as the element of `lit` at index `i` if `x` is greater than or equal to the element of `lit` at index `i` or if `x` is less than the element of `lit` at index `i` and the element of `lit` at index `i` is greater than `y`. Otherwise, `b` has its last two elements as the element of `lit` at index `i` if `y` is greater than or equal to the element of `lit` at index `i` and the element of `lit` at index `i` is greater than `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
