The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1. If the length of list `b` is 0, then `b` remains an empty list and `y` remains positive infinity. Otherwise, `b` is a list of integers with at least one element and `y` is the last element of `b`. If the length of list `a` is 0, then `a` remains an empty list and `x` remains positive infinity. Otherwise, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and `x` is an integer. If `x` is greater than `y`, then `y` is either equal to the element at index `i` in the list `lit` if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, or `y` is updated to `lit[i]` if `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, or `a` is a list of integers with at least two elements, the last element of `a` is greater than `y` and less than or equal to `x`, and `x` is an integer. If `x` is not greater than `y`, then if `x` is equal to `y`, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and its last element is the first element of `lit`, `b` is a list of integers with at least one element, `x` is an integer and is equal to `y` which is the last element of `b`. If `x` is not equal to `y`, then if `x` is less than `y`, either `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `x` is the last element of `a`, `y` is the last element of `b` and is greater than `x`, or `x` is less than `lit[i]` and either `lit[i]` is greater than `y` and the last element of `a` is `lit[i]`, or `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y` and greater than `x` and `y` is equal to `lit[i]`.
