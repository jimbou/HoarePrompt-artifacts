Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `s` is 0, `x` is positive infinity, `y` is less than the element of `lit` at index `i`, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a non-empty list and its last element is the element of `lit` at index `i`.**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been updated to positive infinity, and the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to `x` and `y` are still valid, and the lists `a` and `b` maintain their previous properties.
