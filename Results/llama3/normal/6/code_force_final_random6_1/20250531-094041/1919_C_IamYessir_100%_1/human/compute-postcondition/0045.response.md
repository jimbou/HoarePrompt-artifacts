Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `x` is infinity, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If `b` is empty, `x` is infinity. Otherwise, `b` is a non-empty list, `y` is the last element of `b`. If `a` is empty, `x` is infinity. Otherwise, `a` is a list of integers and `x` is the last element of `a`.**

The code sets the value of `x` to infinity, regardless of its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The state of `b` and `a` is still valid, as the code does not affect them. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
