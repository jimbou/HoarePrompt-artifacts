Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `s` is not defined. If the length of list `b` is 0, then `b` remains an empty list and `y` remains positive infinity. Otherwise, `b` is a list of integers with at least one element and `y` is the last element of `b`. If the length of list `a` is 0, then `a` remains an empty list and `x` remains positive infinity. Otherwise, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and `x` is an integer. The current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `y`. Additionally, the value of `y` is less than the value of `lit[i]`. If `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `y` is updated to `lit[i]`. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x`, then `a` is a list of integers with at least two elements, the last element of `a` is greater than `y` and less than or equal to `x`, and `x` is an integer. Otherwise, the state of `a` remains unchanged.***
