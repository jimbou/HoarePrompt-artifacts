Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is `n`, `s` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `x` is either the last element of `a` or positive infinity if `a` is empty, and `y` is either the last element of `b` or positive infinity if `b` is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been reset to 0, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The lists `a` and `b` still contain their original elements, and the variables `x` and `y` still hold their respective values based on the last elements of `a` and `b` or positive infinity if the lists are empty.
