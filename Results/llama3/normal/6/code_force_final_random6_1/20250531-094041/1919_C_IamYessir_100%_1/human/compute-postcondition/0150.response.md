Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `s` is 0, `a` is a list of integers where the last element is `lit[i]`, `b` is a non-empty list and `y` is the last element of `b`, `x` is the last element of `a` and is less than `y`, `lit[i]` is greater than `y` and is the last element of `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n`, `cp`, `i`, `s` remains the same. The list `a` now has an additional element which is the current element of `lit` at index `i`. The value of `x` is now the last element of `a` which is `lit[i]`. The value of `y` remains the same as the last element of list `b`. The relationship between `x` and `y` remains the same, where `x` is less than `y`. The current element of `lit` at index `i` is greater than `y` and is the last element of `a`.
