Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `x` is an integer if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is positive infinity, `y` is an integer if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is positive infinity, and `s` is the number of times `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]` for `i` in the range from 1 to `len(a) - 1`, plus one, and if `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is increased by one.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the variable `s` has been incremented by one. This means that the number of times `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]` for `i` in the range from 1 to `len(a) - 1` has increased by one, and if `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is also increased by one. All other variables remain unchanged.
