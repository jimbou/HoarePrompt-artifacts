Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is at least 3, `a` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `b` is a list of integers, `x` is either the last element of `a` or positive infinity if `a` is empty, and `y` is either the last element of `b` or positive infinity if `b` is empty. If the current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is 3. Otherwise, `s` is 2.***
