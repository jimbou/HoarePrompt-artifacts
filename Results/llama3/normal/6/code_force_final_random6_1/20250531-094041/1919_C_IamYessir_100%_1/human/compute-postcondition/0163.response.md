Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `s` is 0. If `a` is empty, then `x` is positive infinity, `y` is less than the element of `lit` at index `i`, `a` is a list of integers, and `b` is a non-empty list with its last element being the element of `lit` at index `i`. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `a`, which is either the element of `lit` at index `i` or positive infinity if `a` is empty, and `y` is the last element of `b`, which is either the element of `lit` at index `i` or less than the element of `lit` at index `i`.***
