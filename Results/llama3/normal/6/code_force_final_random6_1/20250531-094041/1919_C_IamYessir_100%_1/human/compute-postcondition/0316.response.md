Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers with at least one or two elements, the last element of `a` is the element at index `i` in the list `lit`, `b` is either an empty list or a list of integers with at least one element, and `y` is either positive infinity if `b` is empty or the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, `x` is the last element of `a` which is the element at index `i` in the list `lit`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still greater than 2, `lit` is still a list of integers, `cp` is still 0, and `i` is still 2. The list `a` now has at least one or two elements, and its last element is the element at index `i` in the list `lit`. The list `b` is either empty or has at least one element, and `y` is either positive infinity if `b` is empty or the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty. The value of `x` is now the last element of `a`, which is the element at index `i` in the list `lit`.
