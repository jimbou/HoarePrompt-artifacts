The code `b.append(lit[i])` appends the value of `lit[i]` to the end of the list `b`. Since `i` is 0, the value of `lit[i]` is the first element of the list `lit`.

The value of `y` is the last element of `b`, which was previously greater than or equal to the current value of `lit[i]`. After appending `lit[i]` to `b`, the last element of `b` is now `lit[i]`, so `y` is updated to be equal to `lit[i]`.

The value of `x` is still greater than the current value of `y`, since the value of `x` has not changed.

The values of `n`, `i`, `lit`, and `cp` are not affected by the code.

The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `b` is a non-empty list, `y` is the first element of `lit`, `x` is greater than `y`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.**
