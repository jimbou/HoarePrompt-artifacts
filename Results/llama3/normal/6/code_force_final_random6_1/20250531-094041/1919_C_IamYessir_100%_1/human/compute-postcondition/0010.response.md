Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `b` is a non-empty list, `cp` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If `a` is empty, `x` is infinity. Otherwise, `a` is a list of integers and `x` is the last element of `a`.***
