Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `s` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a non-empty list with its last element being the element of `lit` at index `i`, `x` is either the last element of `a` or positive infinity if `a` is empty, and `y` is positive infinity.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been updated to positive infinity, regardless of its previous value. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
