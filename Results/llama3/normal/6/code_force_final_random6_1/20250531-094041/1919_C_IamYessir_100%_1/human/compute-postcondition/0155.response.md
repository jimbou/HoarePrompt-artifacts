Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `s` is 0. If `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, then `a` is a list of integers where the last element is `lit[i]`, `b` is a non-empty list and `y` is the last element of `b`, `x` is the last element of `a` and is less than `y`, `lit[i]` is greater than `y` and is the last element of `a`. Otherwise, if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `b` is a non-empty list and its last element is `lit[i]`, `y` is `lit[i]`, `a` is a list of integers and `x` is the last element of `a`, `x` is less than `lit[i]`, `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y` and `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`. Otherwise, the values of `x`, `y`, `a`, `b`, `lit`, `n`, `cp`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged.**
