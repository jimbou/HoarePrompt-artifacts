Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If `b` is empty, `x` is infinity. Otherwise, `b` is a non-empty list, `y` is the last element of `b`. If `a` is empty, `x` is infinity. Otherwise, `a` is a list of integers and `x` is the last element of `a`. The current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `y`. `y` is less than the element of `lit` at index `i`. The element of `lit` at index `i` is less than or equal to `x`. If `x` is greater than or equal to the element of `lit` at index `i` and the element of `lit` at index `i` is greater than `y`, then `x` is the element of `lit` at index `i`.***
