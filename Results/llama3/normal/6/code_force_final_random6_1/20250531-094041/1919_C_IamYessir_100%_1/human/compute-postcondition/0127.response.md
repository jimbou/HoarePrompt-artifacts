Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `b` is a non-empty list, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `s` is 0, `y` is the last element of `b`. If `a` is an empty list, then `x` is positive infinity. Otherwise, `a` is a list of integers and `x` is the last element of `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still greater than 0, `lit` is still a list of integers, `b` is still a non-empty list, `cp` is still 0, `i` is still 0, `s` is still 0. The variable `y` is assigned the value of the last element of `b`. The value of `x` is still dependent on the list `a`. If `a` is empty, then `x` is still positive infinity. Otherwise, `x` is still the last element of `a`.
