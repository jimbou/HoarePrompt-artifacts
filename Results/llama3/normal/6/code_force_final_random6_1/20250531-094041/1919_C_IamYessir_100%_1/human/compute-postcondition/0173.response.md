Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `s` is 0, `a` is a list of integers with its last element being the element of `lit` at index `i`, and `b` is a non-empty list with its last element being the element of `lit` at index `i`. If `b` is empty, then `y` is positive infinity. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`, which is either the element of `lit` at index `i` or less than the element of `lit` at index `i`. If `a` is empty, then `x` is positive infinity. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `a`, which is the element of `lit` at index `i`.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to include the element of `lit` at index `i` as its last element. The value of `x` has also been updated to be the last element of `a`, which is the element of `lit` at index `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.
