Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `s` is not defined. If the length of list `b` is 1, then `b` is a list of integers with one element and `y` is the last element of `b` which is `lit[i]`. Otherwise, `b` is a list of integers with at least two elements and `y` is the last element of `b` which is `lit[i]`. If the length of list `a` is 0, then `a` remains an empty list and `x` remains positive infinity. Otherwise, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and `x` is an integer. The current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `y`. Additionally, the value of `y` is less than the value of `lit[i]`. The current value of `lit[i]` is greater than the current value of `x`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `i`, and `s` remains the same. The list `b` now has at least one element, which is `lit[i]`, and `y` is updated to be the last element of `b`, which is `lit[i]`. The list `a` and the value of `x` remain the same. The relationship between `x` and `y` is still that `x` is greater than `y`, and `y` is less than `lit[i]`, which is greater than `x`.
