Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `s` is 0. If `x` is greater than `y`, then if `y` is greater than or equal to the element of `lit` at index `i`, `b` is a non-empty list and its last element is the element of `lit` at index `i`, `y` is the last element of `b` which is the element of `lit` at index `i`, `a` is a list of integers and `x` is the last element of `a` which is greater than `y`. If `y` is less than the element of `lit` at index `i`, then if the element of `lit` at index `i` is greater than `x`, `b` is a non-empty list and its last element is `lit[i]`, `y` is `lit[i]`, `a` is a list of integers, if `a` is empty then `x` is positive infinity, otherwise `a` is a non-empty list and `x` is the last element of `a`. The current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `y`. The value of `y` is less than the value of `lit` at index `i`. The value of `lit` at index `i` is greater than the current value of `x`. Otherwise, if `x` is greater than or equal to the value of `lit` at index `i` and the value of `lit` at index `i` is greater than `y`, then `a` is a list of integers with the last element being the same as the element of `lit` at index `i`, `b` is a non-empty list, `y` is the last element of `b`, and `x` is the last element of `a` which is also the element of `lit` at index `i`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `x` is less than or equal to `y`, then if `x` is equal to `y`, `a` is a list of integers where the last element is the first element of `lit`, `b` is a non-empty list and `y` is the last element of `b`, and `x` is equal to `y`. If `x` is less than `y`, then either `a` is a list of integers that includes the `i`-th element of `lit`, `x` is the last element of `a` which is the `i`-th element of `lit`, `b` is a non-empty list and `y` is the last element of `b`, and `x` is less than `y`; or one of the following conditions holds: (1) `a` is a list of integers where the last element is `lit[i]`, `b` is a non-empty list and `y` is the last element of `b`, `x` is the last element of `a` and is less than `y`, and `lit[i]` is greater than `y` and is the last element of `a`; (2) `b` is a non-empty list and its last element is `lit[i]`, `y` is `lit[i]`, `a` is a list of integers and `x` is the last element of `a`, `x` is less than `lit[i]`, `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y`, and `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`; (3) otherwise, the values of `x`, `y`, `a`, `b`, `lit`, `n`, `cp`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged. If `x` is not less than `y`, then the values of `x`, `y`, `a`, `b`, `lit`, `n`, `cp`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged.***
