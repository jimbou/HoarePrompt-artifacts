Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `x` is the last element of `a` and is equal to `y`, `y` is the last element of `b`, `x` is less than or equal to `y`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to include the element at index `i` of `lit`, which is the first element of `lit` since `i` is 0. The value of `x` is now equal to the last element of `a`, which is the same as the last element of `b` and therefore equal to `y`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
