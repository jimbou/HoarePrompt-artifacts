The code `x = a[-1]` assigns the value of the last element of list `a` to `x`. Since `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, the last element is an integer. Therefore, the value of `x` is now an integer.

The values of the other variables are not affected by this code. `n` is still an integer greater than 0, `lit` is still a list of integers, `cp` is still 0, `i` is still 0, `a` is still a list of integers with at least one element, `b` is still an empty list, `y` is still positive infinity, and `s` is still not defined.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `b` is an empty list, `x` is an integer, `y` is positive infinity, and `s` is not defined.**
