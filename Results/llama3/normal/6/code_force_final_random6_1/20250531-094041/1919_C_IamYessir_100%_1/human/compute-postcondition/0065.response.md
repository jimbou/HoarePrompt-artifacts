Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `b` is a list of integers, `a` is either empty or a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If `x` equals `y`, `a` contains one more element which is the second element of `lit` (at index 1). If `x` is less than `y`, then if `x` is greater than or equal to the second element of `lit`, `a` contains an extra element which is the second element of `lit`. If `x` is less than the second element of `lit`, `a` remains unchanged. If `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, `a` will have an additional element which is the second element of `lit`. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y`, and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, `b` will have an additional element equal to `lit[1]`.***
