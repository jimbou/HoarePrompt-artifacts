Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `s` is 0, `y` is positive infinity, `a` is a list of integers, and `b` is a non-empty list with its last element being the element of `lit` at index `i`. If `a` is empty, then `x` is positive infinity. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `a`, which is either the element of `lit` at index `i` or positive infinity if `a` is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been updated to positive infinity, while the values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The conditions on `x` and the last element of `b` are still valid, but the value of `y` is now fixed to positive infinity.
