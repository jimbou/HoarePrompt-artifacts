Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `s` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, and `b` is a non-empty list with its last two elements being the element of `lit` at index `i`. If `a` is empty, then `x` is positive infinity. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `a`, which is either the element of `lit` at index `i` or positive infinity if `a` is empty. `y` is the last element of `b`, which is the element of `lit` at index `i`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `i`, `s`, and `a` remains the same as in the initial state. The list `b` now has an additional element at the end, which is the same as the element of `lit` at index `i`. The value of `x` remains the same, but the value of `y` is now the last element of `b`, which is the element of `lit` at index `i`.
