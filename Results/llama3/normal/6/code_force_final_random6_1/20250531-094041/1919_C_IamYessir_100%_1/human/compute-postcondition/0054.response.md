Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `b` is a list of integers, `a` is either empty or a list of integers. If `x` is greater than or equal to the second element of `lit` and the second element of `lit` is greater than `y`, then the second element of `lit` is appended to `a`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `a`. If `b` is empty, `y` is infinity and `x` is the last element of `a`. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b` and `x` is either infinity or the last element of `a`.***
