Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If `b` is empty, `x` and `y` are infinity. Otherwise, `b` is a non-empty list, `y` is the last element of `b`, If `a` is empty, `x` is infinity. Otherwise, `a` is a list of integers and `x` is the last element of `a`. Additionally, `x` is less than or equal to `y`. `x` is not equal to `y`. The current value of `x` is less than the current value of `y`. `x` is less than `lit[i]`. The current value of `lit[i]` is greater than the current value of `y`***
