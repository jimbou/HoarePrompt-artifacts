Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is at least 2, `a` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `b` is a list of integers, `x` is either the last element of `a` or positive infinity if `a` is empty, `y` is either the last element of `b` or positive infinity if `b` is empty, and `s` is either 2 or 1. If the current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is 2. Otherwise, `s` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been incremented by 1. If the current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is now 2. Otherwise, `s` is now 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
