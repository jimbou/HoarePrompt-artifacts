Output State: **n is greater than 2, i is 2, lit is a list of integers, cp is 0, b is a list of integers, a is either empty or a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, y is infinity, x is either infinity or the last element of a if a is not empty.**

In this output state, the value of y has been changed to infinity. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of x is still dependent on whether a is empty or not. If a is empty, x is infinity. Otherwise, x is either infinity or the last element of a. The rest of the conditions and relationships between the variables remain the same as in the initial state.
