Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list of integers and the current value of `x` is the last element of `a` which is the element of `lit` at index `i`, `b` is a non-empty list, `y` is the last element of `b`, the current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `y`, the current value of `y` is less than the element of `lit` at index `i`, the element of `lit` at index `i` is less than or equal to the current value of `x`, the current value of `x` is greater than or equal to the element of `lit` at index `i`, and the element of `lit` at index `i` is greater than the current value of `y`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still greater than 0, `i` is still 0, `lit` is still a list of integers, and `cp` is still 0. The list `a` now contains the element of `lit` at index `i`, which is also the current value of `x`. The list `b` is still non-empty, and `y` is still the last element of `b`. The current value of `x` is still greater than the current value of `y`, and the current value of `y` is still less than the element of `lit` at index `i`. The element of `lit` at index `i` is still less than or equal to the current value of `x`, and the current value of `x` is still greater than or equal to the element of `lit` at index `i`. Additionally, the element of `lit` at index `i` is still greater than the current value of `y`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.
