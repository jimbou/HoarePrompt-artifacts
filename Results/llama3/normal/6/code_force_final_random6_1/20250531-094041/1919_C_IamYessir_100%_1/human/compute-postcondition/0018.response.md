Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. `b` is a non-empty list, `y` is the element of `lit` at index `i`. If `a` is empty, `x` is infinity. Otherwise, `a` is a list of integers and `x` is the last element of `a`. The current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `y`. The element of `lit` at index `i` is greater than the current value of `x`.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been updated to be the element of `lit` at index `i`, which is also the last element of `b`. The other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `x` and `y` is still maintained, with `x` being greater than `y`. Additionally, the element of `lit` at index `i` is still greater than the current value of `x`.
