Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `x` is positive infinity, `a` is either an empty list or a list containing one element which is the first element of `lit`, `b` is either an empty list or a list of integers with at least one element, and if the length of list `a` is 0, then `y` is either positive infinity if `b` is empty, or `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, else `y` is an integer and is the last element of `a`.**

The code sets the value of `x` to positive infinity, regardless of its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to the length of list `a`, the values of `x` and `y`, and the lists `a` and `b` are still valid, but the value of `x` is now specifically positive infinity.
