Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `b` is a list of integers, `a` is either empty or a list of integers and now contains one more element which is the second element of `lit` (at index 1), stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If `b` is empty, `y` is infinity and `x` is the last element of `a` which is the second element of `lit` (at index 1). Otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b` and `x` is either infinity or the last element of `a` which is the second element of `lit` (at index 1).**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables keep their initial values except for `a`. The list `a` now contains one more element which is the second element of `lit` (at index 1). The values of `x` and `y` are updated based on whether `b` is empty or not. If `b` is empty, `y` is infinity and `x` is the last element of `a` which is the second element of `lit` (at index 1). Otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b` and `x` is either infinity or the last element of `a` which is the second element of `lit` (at index 1).
