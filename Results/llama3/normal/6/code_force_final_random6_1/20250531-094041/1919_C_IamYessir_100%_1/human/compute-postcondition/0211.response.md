Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is at least 1, `s` is 1, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `b` is a list of integers, `x` is either the last element of `a` or positive infinity if `a` is empty, and `y` is either the last element of `b` or positive infinity if `b` is empty. The current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `a[i - 1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `s` being 1. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and relationships.
