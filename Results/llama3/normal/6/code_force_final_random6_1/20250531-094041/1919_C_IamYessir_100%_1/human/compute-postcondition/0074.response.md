Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `b` is a list of integers and contains the element at index `i` of `lit` (which is the second element of `lit`), `a` is either empty or a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If `b` is empty, `y` is infinity and `x` is the last element of `a`. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b` which is the second element of `lit` and `x` is either infinity or the last element of `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still greater than 2, `i` is still 2, `lit` remains a list of integers, `cp` is still 0, `b` now contains the second element of `lit` (at index 1), `a` remains either empty or a list of integers, and stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. The values of `x` and `y` depend on whether `b` is empty or not. If `b` is empty, `y` is infinity and `x` is the last element of `a`. If `b` is not empty, `y` is the second element of `lit` (at index 1) and `x` is either infinity or the last element of `a`.
