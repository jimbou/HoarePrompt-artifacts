Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `b` is a list of integers and contains the element at index `i` of `lit` which is the third element of `lit`, `a` is either empty or a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If `b` is empty, `y` is infinity and `x` is the last element of `a`. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b` which is the third element of `lit` and `x` is either infinity or the last element of `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to include the third element of `lit` because `i` is 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to `x` and `y` are also updated based on the new value of `b`.
