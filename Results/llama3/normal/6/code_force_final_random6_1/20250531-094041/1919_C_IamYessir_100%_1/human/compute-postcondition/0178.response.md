Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `s` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, and `b` is a list with its last element being the element of `lit` at index `i`. If `b` is empty, then `y` is positive infinity. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`, which is either the element of `lit` at index `i` or less than the element of `lit` at index `i`. If `a` is empty, then `x` is positive infinity. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `a`, which is either the element of `lit` at index `i` or positive infinity if `a` is empty. If `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, then the last element of `a` is the element of `lit` at index `i`. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then the last two elements of `b` are the element of `lit` at index `i` and `y` is the last element of `b`, which is the element of `lit` at index `i`.***
