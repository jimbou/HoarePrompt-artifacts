Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `s` is 0. If `y` is greater than or equal to the element of `lit` at index `i`, then `a` is a list of integers, and `b` is a non-empty list with its last two elements being the element of `lit` at index `i`. `x` is the last element of `a`, which is either the element of `lit` at index `i` or positive infinity if `a` is empty. `y` is the last element of `b`, which is the element of `lit` at index `i`. If `y` is less than the element of `lit` at index `i`, then if `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, `b` is a non-empty list with its last two elements being the element of `lit` at index `i`, and `y` is the last element of `b`, which is the element of `lit` at index `i`. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x`, then if `x` is greater than or equal to the element of `lit` at index `i` and the element of `lit` at index `i` is greater than `y`, then `a` is a list of integers with its last element being the element of `lit` at index `i`, and `b` is a non-empty list with its last element being the element of `lit` at index `i`. Otherwise, `a` and `b` remain unchanged. `x` is the last element of `a`, which is either the element of `lit` at index `i` or positive infinity if `a` is empty. `y` is the last element of `b`, which is either the element of `lit` at index `i` or less than the element of `lit` at index `i` if `b` is not empty, or positive infinity if `b` is empty.***
