Output State: **`n` is 0, `i` is 3, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `b` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `a` is a list of integers, `s` is the number of times `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]` for all `i` in the range from 1 to the length of `a` plus one.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains 0, `i` remains 3, `lit` remains a list of integers, `cp` remains 0, `b` remains a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `a` remains a list of integers, and `s` is incremented by 1, now representing the number of times `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]` for all `i` in the range from 1 to the length of `a`, plus one additional increment.
