To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than the length of `a`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `a` must have at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The length of `a` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `b` is a list of integers, `x` is an integer if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is positive infinity, `y` is an integer if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is positive infinity. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is 1. Otherwise, `s` remains 0.**
