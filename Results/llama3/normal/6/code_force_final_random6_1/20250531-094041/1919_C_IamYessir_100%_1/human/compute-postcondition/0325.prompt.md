Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, lit is a list of integers, cp is 0, i is equal to len(b), a is an empty list, b is an empty list, x is positive infinity, y is positive infinity, and s is not defined. Stdin contains no input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if len(a) == 0:
        x = float('inf')
    else:
        x = a[-1]
    if len(b) == 0:
        y = float('inf')
    else:
        y = b[-1]
    if x > y:
        if y >= lit[i]:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
    elif x == y:
        a.append(lit[i])
    elif x < y:
        if x >= lit[i]:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0. If the length of list `b` is 0, then `b` remains an empty list and `y` remains positive infinity. Otherwise, `b` is a list of integers with at least one element and `y` is the last element of `b`. If the length of list `a` is 0, then `a` remains an empty list and `x` remains positive infinity. Otherwise, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and `x` is an integer. If `x` is greater than `y`, then `y` is either equal to the element at index `i` in the list `lit` if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, or `y` is updated to `lit[i]` if `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, or `a` is a list of integers with at least two elements, the last element of `a` is greater than `y` and less than or equal to `x`, and `x` is an integer. If `x` is not greater than `y`, then if `x` is equal to `y`, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and its last element is the first element of `lit`, `b` is a list of integers with at least one element, `x` is an integer and is equal to `y` which is the last element of `b`. If `x` is not equal to `y`, then if `x` is less than `y`, either `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `x` is the last element of `a`, `y` is the last element of `b` and is greater than `x`, or `x` is less than `lit[i]` and either `lit[i]` is greater than `y` and the last element of `a` is `lit[i]`, or `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y` and greater than `x` and `y` is equal to `lit[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1. If the length of list `a` is 0, then `x` is positive infinity, `y` is either positive infinity if `b` is empty, or `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, `a` is either an empty list or a list containing one element which is the first element of `lit`, and `b` is either an empty list or a list of integers with at least one element. If the length of list `a` is not 0, then `x` is an integer and is the last element of `a`, `a` is a list of integers with at least one or two elements, the last element of `a` is either the last element of `a` before the if else block or the element at index `i` in the list `lit`, `b` is either an empty list and `y` is positive infinity, or `b` is a list of integers with at least one element and `y` is the last element of `b`. If `x` is greater than `y`, then `y` is either equal to the element at index `i` in the list `lit` if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, or `y` is updated to `lit[i]` if `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, or `a` is a list of integers with at least two elements, the last element of `a` is greater than `y` and less than or equal to `x`, and `x` is an integer. If `x` is not greater than `y`, then if `x` is equal to `y`, `a` is a list of integers with at least one or two elements and its last element is either the last element of `a` before the if else block or the first element of `lit`, `b` is a list of integers with at least one element, `x` is an integer and is equal to `y` which is the last element of `b`. If `x` is not equal to `y`, then if `x` is less than `y`, either `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `x` is the last element of `a`, `y` is the last element of `b` and is greater than `x`, or `x` is less than `lit[i]` and either `lit[i]` is greater than `y` and the last element of `a` is `lit[i]`, or `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y` and greater than `x` and `y` is equal to `lit[i]`. The list `b` has been appended with the element at index `i` in the list `lit` if `y` is less than `lit[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2. If the length of list `a` is 0, then `x` is positive infinity, `a` is either an empty list or a list containing one element which is the first element of `lit`, `b` is either an empty list or a list of integers with at least one element, and `y` is either positive infinity if `b` is empty or the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty. If the length of list `a` is not 0, then `x` is the last element of `a`, `a` is a list of integers with at least one or two elements, the last element of `a` is either the last element of `a` before the if else block or the element at index `i` in the list `lit`, `b` is either an empty list and `y` is positive infinity, or `b` is a list of integers with at least one element and `y` is the last element of `b`. If `x` is greater than `y`, then `y` is either equal to the element at index `i` in the list `lit` if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, or `y` is updated to `lit[i]` if `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, or `a` is a list of integers with at least two elements, the last element of `a` is greater than `y` and less than or equal to `x`, and `x` is an integer. If `x` is not greater than `y`, then if `x` is equal to `y`, `a` is a list of integers with at least one or two elements and its last element is either the last element of `a` before the if else block or the first element of `lit`, `b` is a list of integers with at least one element, `x` is an integer and is equal to `y` which is the last element of `b`. If `x` is not equal to `y`, then if `x` is less than `y`, either `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `x` is the last element of `a`, `y` is the last element of `b` and is greater than `x`, or `x` is less than `lit[i]` and either `lit[i]` is greater than `y` and the last element of `a` is `lit[i]`, or `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y` and greater than `x` and `y` is equal to `lit[i]`. The list `b` has been appended with the element at index `i` in the list `lit` if `y` is less than `lit[i]`. If `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, then the last element of `a` is the element at index `i` in the list `lit`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
