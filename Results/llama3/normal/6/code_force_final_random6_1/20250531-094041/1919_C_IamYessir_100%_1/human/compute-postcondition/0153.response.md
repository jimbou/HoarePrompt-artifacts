Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `s` is 0, `b` is a non-empty list and its last element is `lit[i]`, `y` is `lit[i]`, `a` is a list of integers and `x` is the last element of `a`, `x` is less than `lit[i]`, `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y` and `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n`, `cp`, `i`, `s` and `lit` remains the same. The list `b` is no longer empty and its last element is now `lit[i]`. The value of `y` is now `lit[i]`. The value of `x` is still less than `lit[i]`. The value of `lit[i]` is still less than or equal to `y` and `y` is still greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is still greater than `x`.
