Output State: **`n` is 0, `i` is 3, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `b` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is 3, otherwise `s` is 2. stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If `b` is empty, `y` is infinity and `x` is the last element of `a`. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b` and `x` is either infinity or the last element of `a`. The values of `x` and `y` are compared and updated based on their values and the values in `lit`. If `x` is greater than `y`, then `y` is updated to the last element of `lit` if `y` is greater than or equal to the last element of `lit`, otherwise `x` is updated to the last element of `lit` if the last element of `lit` is greater than `y`. If `x` is less than or equal to `y`, then either `x` is updated to the last element of `a` which is equal to the last element of `lit`, or `y` is updated to the last element of `b` which is equal to the last element of `lit`, or `x` is updated to the last element of `lit` if the last element of `lit` is greater than `y`, or `y` is updated to the last element of `lit` if `y` is greater than or equal to the last element of `lit` and the last element of `lit` is greater than `x`.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `s`, `x`, and `y` are still valid, but the value of `s` has been updated.
