Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `r` is 0, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `cn` is 1 or 2 depending on whether the first two elements of `num` are equal or not, `ck` is 1, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code snippet only contains a `break` statement, which means that the program will exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently in. The values of all variables remain unchanged. The only change is that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
