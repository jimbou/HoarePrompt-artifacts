Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, r is 1, stdin contains t - 3 test cases, n is an integer greater than 2, num is a list of n integers between 1 and n, onum is a reversed copy of num, ck is the length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the first element of num, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the last element of num, i is 1, j is n - 1, f is 1. If the current value of num[i] is equal to num[i + 1], then cn is 2 * ck + 2. Otherwise, cn is 2 * ck + 1 if the first element of num is equal to the last element of num, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
