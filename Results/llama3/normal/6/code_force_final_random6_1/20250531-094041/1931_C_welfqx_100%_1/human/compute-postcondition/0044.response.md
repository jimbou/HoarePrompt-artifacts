Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `r` is 0, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 2 * 10^5, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is `n - 1`, `cn` is the length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the first element of `num`, and `ii` is `n` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside, but does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, all variables retain their original values, and we simply add the fact that we have broken out of the loop or if statement.
