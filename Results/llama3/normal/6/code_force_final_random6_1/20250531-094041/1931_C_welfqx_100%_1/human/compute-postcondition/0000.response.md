The code accepts an integer input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) first and that integer is assigned into `t`. So stdin now contains t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n). Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n).
Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n).**
