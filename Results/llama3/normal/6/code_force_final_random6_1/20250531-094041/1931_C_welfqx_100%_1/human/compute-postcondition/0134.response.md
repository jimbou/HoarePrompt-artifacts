Output State: **`num` is a list of integers, `n` must be at least 2, `cn` is 1, `ck` is 1, `f` is 1, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `i` is 0, and the element at index `i` of `num` is not equal to the element at index `i + 1` of `num`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the additional information that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `n`, `num`, and the relationship between the elements at indices `i` and `i + 1` of `num` still hold.
