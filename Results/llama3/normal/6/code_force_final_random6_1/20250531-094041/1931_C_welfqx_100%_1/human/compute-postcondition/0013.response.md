Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, r is 0, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, f is either 0 or 1, num is a list of n integers between 1 and n, j is n - 1.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of j is n - 1, indicating that the loop has iterated n - 1 times. The value of f is either 0 or 1, depending on whether any pair of adjacent elements in the list num are not equal. If any pair of adjacent elements are not equal, f is 0; otherwise, f is 1. The values of t, r, stdin, and num remain unchanged.
