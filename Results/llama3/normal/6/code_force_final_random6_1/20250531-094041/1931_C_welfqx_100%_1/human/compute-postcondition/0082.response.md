The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, r is 1, stdin contains t - 3 test cases, n is an integer greater than 2, num is a list of n integers between 1 and n, onum is a reversed copy of num, ck is the length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the first element of num, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the last element of num, i is 1, cn is 2 * ck + 1 if the first element of num is equal to the last element of num, j is n - 1, f is 1. If the current value of num[i] is equal to num[i + 1], then cn is 2 * ck + 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
