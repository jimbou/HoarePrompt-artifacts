Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `r` is 1, stdin contains `t - 3` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `num` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `ck` is the length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the first element of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is 2, `j` is `n - 1`, `f` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The break statement does not change the values of any variables, but it does exit the current loop or if statement.
