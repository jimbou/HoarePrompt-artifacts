Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, r is 1, stdin contains t - 3 test cases, n is an integer greater than 1, num is a list of n integers between 1 and n, onum is a reversed copy of num, ck is the length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the first element of num, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the last element of num, i is 0, cn is 2 * ck + 1, j is n - 1, f is 1. The current value of num[i] is equal to num[i + 1].**

In this output state, the value of cn has been incremented by 1, as specified in the code. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of cn is now 2 * ck + 1, where ck is the length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the first element of num. The rest of the variables retain their original values and properties.
