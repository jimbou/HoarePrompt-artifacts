To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variables in the loop head, which are `r` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, we can adjust the state to ensure `t` is at least 1. Additionally, since `r` is the loop variable, we can set its initial value to 0.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `r` is 0, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n)**
