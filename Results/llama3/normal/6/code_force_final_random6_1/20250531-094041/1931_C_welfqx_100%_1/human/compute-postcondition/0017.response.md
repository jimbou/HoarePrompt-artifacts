The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration only. Since the current value of `n` is 1 or the current value of `f` is 1, and 0 is being printed, the `continue` statement will skip the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration only. The values of the variables `t`, `r`, `n`, `f`, `num`, and `j` are not affected. The stdin still contains `t - 1` test cases.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `r` is 0, stdin contains `t - 1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `f` is either 0 or 1, `num` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `j` is `n - 1`, and we skip the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration only.**
