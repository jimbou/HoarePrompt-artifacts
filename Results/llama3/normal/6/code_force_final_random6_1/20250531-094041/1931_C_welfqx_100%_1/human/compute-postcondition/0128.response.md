Postcondition: **The number of elements to be removed from the list num to make it a list of equal elements is printed, which is n - max(cn, ck). If n is 1 or f is 1, then 0 is printed and the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop is skipped, moving to the next iteration. Otherwise, if num[j] is not equal to num[j + 1], then j is incremented by 1 and f is set to 0. If num[j] is equal to num[j + 1], then no change is made.**
