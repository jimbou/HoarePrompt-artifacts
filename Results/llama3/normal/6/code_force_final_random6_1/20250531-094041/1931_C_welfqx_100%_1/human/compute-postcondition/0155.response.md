To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head and the conditions that must be met for the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for ii in range(n - 1):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `ii` is less than `n - 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `ii` is incremented by 1, so for the loop to execute again, `ii` must be less than `n - 1`.

The only variable in the loop head that needs to be adjusted is `ii`. Since `ii` is incremented by 1, it should be increased by 1 for the loop to execute again.

The state of `n` does not need to be adjusted, as it is not modified within the loop.

The other variables (`num`, `cn`, `symb1`, `symb2`, `onum`, `f`, and `ck`) are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution. Therefore, their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`num` is a list of integers, `n` is greater than 1, `cn` is the number of consecutive equal elements from the start of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `ii` is incremented by 1, `f` is 1, and `ck` is either 1, 2, or 3**
