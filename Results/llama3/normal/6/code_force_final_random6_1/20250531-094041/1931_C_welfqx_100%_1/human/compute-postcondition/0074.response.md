Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, r is 1, stdin contains t - 3 test cases, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, num is a list of n integers between 1 and n, onum is a reversed copy of num, ck is the length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the first element of num, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the last element of num, i is n - 1, cn is twice the length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the first element of num if the first element of num is equal to the last element of num, j is n - 1. If n is 1 or there are two adjacent elements in num that are not equal, then 0 is printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the execution of the program continues.***
