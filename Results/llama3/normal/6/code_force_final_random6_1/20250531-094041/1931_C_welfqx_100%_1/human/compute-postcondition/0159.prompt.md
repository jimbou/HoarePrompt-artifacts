Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: num is a list of integers, n is an integer, cn is the number of consecutive equal elements from the start of num, ck is 1, f is 1, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the last element of num, onum is a reversed copy of num
Code of the loop:
for ii in range(n - 1):
    if onum[ii] == onum[ii + 1]:
        ck += 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`num` is a list of integers, `n` is greater than 1, `cn` is the number of consecutive equal elements from the start of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`. If the current value of `onum[ii]` is equal to the current value of `onum[ii + 1]`, then `ck` is 2 and `f` is 1. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, with `ck` being 1 and `f` being 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`num` is a list of integers, `n` is greater than 1, `cn` is the number of consecutive equal elements from the start of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `ii` is incremented by 1, and `f` is 1. If the current and next elements in the reversed list `onum` are equal, then `ck` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, `ck` is either 1 or 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`num` is a list of integers, `n` is greater than 1, `cn` is the number of consecutive equal elements from the start of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `ii` is incremented by 1, `f` is 1, and `ck` is either 2, 3, or 4 if the last two elements of `onum` are equal, otherwise `ck` is either 1, 2, or 3 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
