This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a list of integers. It then analyzes each list to find the maximum length of contiguous sequences of equal elements at the beginning and end of the list. If the first and last elements of the list are equal, it combines these sequences. Finally, it prints the difference between the total number of elements in the list and the maximum length of these sequences.
