Postcondition: ***`num` is a list of integers, `n` is at least 3, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `i` is 1. If the current and next elements of `num` are equal, then `cn` is either 3 or 2 and `ck` is 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and if the first two elements of `num` are equal, then `cn` is 2 and `ck` is 1. Otherwise, `cn` is 1 and `ck` is 1.***
