Output State: **`num` is a list of integers, `n` is at least 3, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `cn` is either 3 or 2, `ck` is 1, `i` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `cn` is either 3 or 2 because it was incremented by 1 from its previous value, which was either 2 or 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
