Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, r is 1, stdin contains t - 3 test cases, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, num is a list of n integers between 1 and n, onum is a reversed copy of num, ck is the length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the first element of num, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the last element of num, i is n - 1, cn is twice the length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the first element of num if the first element of num is equal to the last element of num. j is n - 1 and f is 0 if there are two adjacent elements in num that are not equal. Otherwise, f remains unchanged.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations. The loop head variable `j` has reached its final value of `n - 1`, indicating that the loop has iterated over all elements in the list `num`. The variable `f` has been updated to 0 if there are any two adjacent elements in `num` that are not equal, otherwise it remains unchanged. The other variables in the precondition remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop head and body.
