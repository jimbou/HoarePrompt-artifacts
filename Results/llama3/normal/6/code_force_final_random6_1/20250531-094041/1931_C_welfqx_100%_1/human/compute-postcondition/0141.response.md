Output State: **`num` is a list of integers, `n` is at least 3, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `i` is 2. If the current and next elements of `num` are equal, then `cn` is either 4 or 3 and `ck` is 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and if the first two elements of `num` are equal, then `cn` is 3 and `ck` is 1. Otherwise, `cn` is 2 and `ck` is 1.**

The value of `cn` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `cn` depends on the equality of the current and next elements of `num`. If they are equal, `cn` was either 3 or 2, so now it is either 4 or 3. If they are not equal, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. In this case, if the first two elements of `num` are equal, `cn` was 2, so now it is 3. Otherwise, `cn` was 1, so now it is 2. The values of the other variables are not affected.
