To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of `n` and `j` since they are the variables in the loop head.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `n - 1` is at least 1, which means `n` must be at least 2. Since `j` is the loop variable, it will start from 0 and go up to `n - 2`.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `r` is 1, `stdin` contains `t - 3` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `j` is 0, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `ck` is the length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the first element of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is `n - 1`, `cn` is twice the length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the first element of `num` if the first element of `num` is equal to the last element of `num`**
