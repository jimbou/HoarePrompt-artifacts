Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, r is 0, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, f is 1, num is a list of n integers between 1 and n, j is n - 1, onum is a reversed copy of num, cn is 1, ck is 1, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the last element of num.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if num[i] == num[i + 1]:
        cn += 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `r` is 0, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `cn` is 1 or 2 depending on whether the first two elements of `num` are equal or not, `ck` is 1, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is 0, and either the first two elements of `num` are equal or the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `r` is 0, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `ck` is 1, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is 1. If the first two elements of `num` are equal, then `cn` is 2 or 3. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement and `cn` is 1 or 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `r` is 0, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `ck` is 1, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is 2. If `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, then `cn` is increased by 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
