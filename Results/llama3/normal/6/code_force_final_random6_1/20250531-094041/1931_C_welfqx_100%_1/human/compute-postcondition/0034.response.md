Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `r` is 0, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `ck` is 1, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is `n - 1`, and `cn` is the length of the longest prefix of `num` where all elements are equal.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for all variables except `i` and `cn`. The variable `i` will be equal to `n - 1`, indicating that the loop has iterated over all elements in the list `num`. The variable `cn` will be equal to the length of the longest prefix of `num` where all elements are equal. This means that `cn` will be the number of consecutive equal elements at the beginning of the list `num`.
