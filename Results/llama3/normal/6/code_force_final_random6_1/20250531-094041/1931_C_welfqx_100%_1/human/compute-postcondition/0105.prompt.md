Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, r is 1, stdin contains t - 3 test cases, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, num is a list of n integers between 1 and n, onum is a reversed copy of num, ck is the length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the first element of num, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the last element of num, i is n - 1, cn is 2 * ck + k if the first element of num is equal to the last element of num and the kth iteration of the loop is the last iteration where num[i] is equal to num[i + 1], j is n - 1, f is 1.
Code of the loop:
for ii in range(n - 1):
    if onum[ii] == onum[ii + 1]:
        ck += 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, r is 1, stdin contains t - 3 or t - 4 test cases, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, num is a list of n integers between 1 and n, onum is a reversed copy of num, ck is the length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the first element of num, which is either incremented by 1 if the current and next elements of onum are equal, or remains the same if they are not, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the last element of num, i is n - 1, cn is 2 * ck + k if the first element of num is equal to the last element of num and the kth iteration of the loop is the last iteration where num[i] is equal to num[i + 1], j is n - 1, f is 1, ii is 0. The current value of onum[ii] is either equal to the current value of onum[ii + 1] or not, and if not, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, r is 1, stdin contains t - 3 or t - 4 test cases, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, num is a list of n integers between 1 and n, onum is a reversed copy of num, ck is the length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the first element of num, which is either incremented by 1 if the current and next elements of onum are equal, or remains the same if they are not, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the last element of num, i is n - 1, cn is 2 * ck + k if the first element of num is equal to the last element of num and the kth iteration of the loop is the last iteration where num[i] is equal to num[i + 1], j is n - 1, f is 1, and ii is n - 1. If onum[ii] is equal to onum[ii + 1], then ck is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `r` is 1, stdin contains `t - 3` or `t - 4` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `num` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `ck` is the length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the first element of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is `n - 1`, `cn` is `2 * ck + k` if the first element of `num` is equal to the last element of `num` and the `k`th iteration of the loop is the last iteration where `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, `j` is `n - 1`, `f` is 1, and `ii` is `n`. If `onum[ii]` is equal to `onum[ii + 1]`, then `ck` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
