Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, consider the input:

    8
    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

The program will output 7, but the correct output should be 7, because we can make all elements equal by assigning the value 1 to the first element, and then assigning the value 8 to the rest of the elements.

The issue with the program is that it only considers the longest sequence of equal elements from the start and end of the array, and does not consider other possible sequences. It also does not consider the case where the longest sequence of equal elements is not at the start or end of the array.

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to consider all possible sequences of equal elements, not just the longest ones from the start and end of the array.
