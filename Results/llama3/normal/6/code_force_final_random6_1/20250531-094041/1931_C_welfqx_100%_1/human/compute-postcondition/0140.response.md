The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be at least 3.
State: **`num` is a list of integers, `n` is at least 3, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `i` is 2. If the current and next elements of `num` are equal, then `cn` is either 3 or 2 and `ck` is 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and if the first two elements of `num` are equal, then `cn` is 2 and `ck` is 1. Otherwise, `cn` is 1 and `ck` is 1.**
