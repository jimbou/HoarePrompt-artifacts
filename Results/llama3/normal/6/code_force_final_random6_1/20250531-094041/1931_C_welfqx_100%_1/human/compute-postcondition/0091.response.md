To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `ii` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 2, since the range is `n - 1`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be greater than or equal to 2, and `ii` should be 0, as it is the starting value of the range.

State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, r is 1, stdin contains t - 3 test cases, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, num is a list of n integers between 1 and n, onum is a reversed copy of num, ck is the length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the first element of num, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the last element of num, i is n - 1, cn is 2 * ck + k if the first element of num is equal to the last element of num and the kth iteration of the loop is the last iteration where num[i] is equal to num[i + 1], j is n - 1, f is 1, ii is 0**
