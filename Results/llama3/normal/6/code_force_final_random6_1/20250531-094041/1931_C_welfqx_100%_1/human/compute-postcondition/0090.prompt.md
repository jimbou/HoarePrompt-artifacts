Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, r is 1, stdin contains t - 3 test cases, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, num is a list of n integers between 1 and n, onum is a reversed copy of num, ck is the length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the first element of num, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the last element of num, i is n - 1, cn is twice the length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the first element of num if the first element of num is equal to the last element of num, j is n - 1, f is 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if num[i] == num[i + 1]:
        cn += 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, r is 1, stdin contains t - 3 test cases, n is an integer greater than 1, num is a list of n integers between 1 and n, onum is a reversed copy of num, ck is the length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the first element of num, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the last element of num, i is 0, cn is 2 * ck + 1 if the first element of num is equal to the last element of num, j is n - 1, f is 1. If the current value of num[i] is equal to num[i + 1], then cn is 2 * ck + 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, r is 1, stdin contains t - 3 test cases, n is an integer greater than 2, num is a list of n integers between 1 and n, onum is a reversed copy of num, ck is the length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the first element of num, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the last element of num, i is 1, j is n - 1, f is 1. If the current value of num[i] is equal to num[i + 1], then cn is 2 * ck + 2. Otherwise, cn is 2 * ck + 1 if the first element of num is equal to the last element of num, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `r` is 1, stdin contains `t - 3` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `num` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `ck` is the length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the first element of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is 2, `j` is `n - 1`, `f` is 1. If the current value of `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, then `cn` is 2 * `ck + 3`. If the current value of `num[i]` is not equal to `num[i + 1]`, then either `cn` is 2 * `ck + 2` if the first element of `num` is equal to the last element of `num`, or we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
