Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `r` is 1, stdin contains `t - 3` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `num` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `ck` is the length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the first element of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is 2, `j` is `n - 1`, `f` is 1, `cn` is either 2 * `ck + 3` if the current value of `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, or 2 * `ck + 2` if the first element of `num` is equal to the last element of `num`.**

In this output state, the value of `cn` has been incremented by 1. If the current value of `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, then `cn` is now 2 * `ck + 3`. Otherwise, if the first element of `num` is equal to the last element of `num`, then `cn` is now 2 * `ck + 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
