Output State: **`num` is a list of integers, `n` is at least 2, `cn` is 2, `ck` is 1, `f` is 1, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `i` is 0, and the current value of `num[i]` is equal to the current value of `num[i + 1]`.**

The code increments the value of `cn` by 1, so its new value is 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
