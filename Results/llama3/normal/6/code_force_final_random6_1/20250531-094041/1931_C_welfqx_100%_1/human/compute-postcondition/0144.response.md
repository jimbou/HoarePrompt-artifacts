Output State: **num is a list of integers, n is an integer, cn is the number of consecutive equal elements from the start of num, ck is 1, f is 1, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the last element of num, onum is a reversed copy of num**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `cn` will hold the number of consecutive equal elements from the start of the list `num`. The other variables remain unchanged.
