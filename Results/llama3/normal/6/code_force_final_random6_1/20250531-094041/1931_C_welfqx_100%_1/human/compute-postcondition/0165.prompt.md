Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n).
Code of the loop:
for r in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    f = 1
    num = [int(_) for _ in input().split()]
    for j in range(n - 1):
        if num[j] != num[j + 1]:
            f = 0
            break
    if n == 1 or f == 1:
        print(0)
        continue
    onum = num.copy()
    onum.reverse()
    cn = 1
    ck = 1
    f = 1
    symb1 = num[0]
    symb2 = onum[0]
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if num[i] == num[i + 1]:
            cn += 1
        else:
            break
    for ii in range(n - 1):
        if onum[ii] == onum[ii + 1]:
            ck += 1
        else:
            break
    if symb1 == symb2:
        cn += ck
    print(n - max(cn, ck))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `r` is 0, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `ck` is the length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the first element of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is `n - 1`. If the first element of `num` is equal to the last element of `num`, then `cn` is twice the length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the first element of `num`. The difference between the number of elements in the list `num` and the maximum of `cn` and `ck` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, r is 1, stdin contains t - 3 or t - 4 test cases, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, num is a list of n integers between 1 and n, onum is a reversed copy of num, ck is the length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the first element of num, if the first element of num (symb1) is equal to the last element of num (symb2), then i is n - 1, cn is 3 * ck + k if the kth iteration of the loop is the last iteration where num[i] is equal to num[i + 1], j is n - 1, f is 1, and ii is n - 1, and the number of elements to be removed from the list num to make it a list of equal elements is printed, which is n - max(cn, ck)

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: num is a list of integers, n is an integer, cn is the number of consecutive equal elements from the start of num, ck is a value between 1 and n, f is 1, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the last element of num, onum is a reversed copy of num. If the first and last elements of num are equal, then cn is the length of num plus a value between 1 and n. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. The difference between n and the maximum value between cn and ck is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
