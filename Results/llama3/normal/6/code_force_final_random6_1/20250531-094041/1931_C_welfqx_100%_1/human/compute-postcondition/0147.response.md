Output State: **`num` is a list of integers, `n` is greater than 1, `cn` is the number of consecutive equal elements from the start of num, `ck` is 2, `f` is 1, `symb1` is the first element of num, `symb2` is the last element of num, `onum` is a reversed copy of num, `ii` is 0. The current value of `onum[ii]` is equal to the current value of `onum[ii + 1]`**

The code increments the value of `ck` by 1, so its new value is 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that the current value of `onum[ii]` is equal to the current value of `onum[ii + 1]` is still valid.
