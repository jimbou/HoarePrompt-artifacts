Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal. 

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It first checks if the array has only one element or if all elements are equal. If so, it prints 0 because no operation is needed.

2. If the array has more than one element and not all elements are equal, it creates a reversed copy of the array.

3. It then finds the length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the first element of the array (cn) and the length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the last element of the array (ck).

4. If the first element of the array is equal to the last element of the array, it doubles the value of cn.

5. Finally, it prints the difference between the number of elements in the array and the maximum of cn and ck. This is the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal.

The program's logic is correct and it handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
