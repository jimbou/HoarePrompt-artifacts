The `print(n - max(cn, ck))` statement will print the result of subtracting the maximum value between `cn` and `ck` from `n`.

Here's a breakdown of the variables involved:

*   `n`: an integer
*   `cn`: the number of consecutive equal elements from the start of `num`. If the first and last elements of `num` are equal, then `cn` is the length of `num` plus a value between 1 and `n`. Otherwise, the state of `cn` remains unchanged.
*   `ck`: a value between 1 and `n`

Since the exact values of `n`, `cn`, and `ck` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the result of the subtraction.

Output: **n - max(cn, ck) (where n is an integer, cn is the number of consecutive equal elements from the start of num, and ck is a value between 1 and n)**
