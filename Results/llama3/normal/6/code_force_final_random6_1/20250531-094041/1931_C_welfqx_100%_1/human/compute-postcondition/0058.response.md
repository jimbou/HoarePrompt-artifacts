Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, r is 1, stdin contains t - 3 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, f is 1, num is a list of n integers between 1 and n, j is n - 1, onum is a reversed copy of num, ck is the length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the first element of num, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the last element of num, i is n - 1, cn is twice the length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the first element of num if the first element of num is equal to the last element of num.**

The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to n. Since stdin contains t - 2 test cases, it now contains t - 3 test cases. The second line assigns 1 to f, but since f was already 1, its value remains unchanged. The third line reads a list of n integers from stdin, assigns it to num, and updates the values of j, onum, ck, symb1, symb2, and i accordingly. The value of cn is also updated if the first element of num is equal to the last element of num.
