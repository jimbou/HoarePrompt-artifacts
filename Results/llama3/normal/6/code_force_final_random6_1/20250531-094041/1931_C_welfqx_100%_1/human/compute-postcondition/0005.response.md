The first line assigns the value of 0 to `f`, changing its value from 1 to 0. The second line is a break statement, but since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, it does not affect the state of any variables. No other variables are affected by the code.

Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, r is 0, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, f is 0, num is a list of n integers between 1 and n, j is 0. The current value of num[j] is not equal to num[j + 1]**
