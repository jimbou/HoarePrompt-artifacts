Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4, r is 2, stdin contains t - 4 test cases, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, num is a list of n integers between 1 and n, onum is a reversed copy of num, ck is the length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the first element of num, if the first element of num (symb1) is equal to the last element of num (symb2), then i is n - 1, cn is 3 * ck + k if the kth iteration of the loop is the last iteration where num[i] is equal to num[i + 1], j is n - 1, f is 1, and ii is n - 1, and the number of elements to be removed from the list num to make it a list of equal elements is printed, which is n - max(cn, ck)**

The code snippet reads an integer `n` from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. It then reads a list of `n` integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `num`. The variable `f` is set to 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
