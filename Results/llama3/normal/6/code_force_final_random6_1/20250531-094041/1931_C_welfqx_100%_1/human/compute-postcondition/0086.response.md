The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `r` is 1, stdin contains `t - 3` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `num` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `ck` is the length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the first element of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is 2, `j` is `n - 1`, `f` is 1. If the current value of `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, then `cn` is 2 * `ck + 2`. Otherwise, `cn` is 2 * `ck + 1` if the first element of `num` is equal to the last element of `num`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
