Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `r` is 0, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `ck` is 1, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is 2. If `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, then `cn` is increased by 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
