Output State: **`num` is a list of integers, `n` is greater than 1, `cn` is the number of consecutive equal elements from the start of `num`, `ck` is 1, `f` is 1, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `ii` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code `break` only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, without changing the values of any variables. Therefore, all variables retain their original values and properties.
