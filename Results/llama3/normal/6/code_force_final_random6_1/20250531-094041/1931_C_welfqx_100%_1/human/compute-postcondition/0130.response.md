To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 2 (since the range is `n - 1`).

State: **`num` is a list of integers, `n` must be at least 2, `cn` is 1, `ck` is 1, `f` is 1, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `i` is 0**
