Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `r` is 1, stdin contains t - 3 test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `num` is a list of n integers between 1 and n, `onum` is a reversed copy of num, `ck` is the length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the first element of num, `symb1` is the first element of num, `symb2` is the last element of num, `i` is 1, `cn` is 2 * ck + 2 if the current value of num[i] is equal to num[i + 1], `j` is n - 1, `f` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `cn` has been incremented by 1, but only if the current value of `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for `cn` is now more specific, as it depends on the comparison between `num[i]` and `num[i + 1]`.
