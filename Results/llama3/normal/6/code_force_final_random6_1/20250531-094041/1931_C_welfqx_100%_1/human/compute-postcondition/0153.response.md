Output State: **`num` is a list of integers, `n` is greater than 1, `cn` is the number of consecutive equal elements from the start of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `ii` is incremented by 1, `ck` is either 1 or 2, and `f` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside.
