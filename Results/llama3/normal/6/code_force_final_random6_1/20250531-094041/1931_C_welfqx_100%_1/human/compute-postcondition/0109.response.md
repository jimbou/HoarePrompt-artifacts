The code prints the difference between the length of the list `num` (which is `n`) and the maximum value between `cn` and `ck`. 

`ck` is the length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the first element of `num`. 

`cn` is `3 * ck + k` if the `kth` iteration of the loop is the last iteration where `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`. 

Since `ck` is the length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the first element of `num`, and `cn` is `3 * ck + k`, `cn` will always be greater than or equal to `ck`. 

Therefore, `max(cn, ck)` will always be `cn`. 

So, the code prints `n - cn`. 

Since `cn` is `3 * ck + k`, the code prints `n - (3 * ck + k)`. 

Output: **n - (3 * ck + k) (where n is the length of the list num, ck is the length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the first element of num, and k is the last iteration where num[i] is equal to num[i + 1])**
