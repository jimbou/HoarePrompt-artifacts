Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `r` is 0, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `ck` is 1, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is `n - 1`, and `cn` is the length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the first element of `num`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that the loop has iterated over the entire list `num` and has counted the length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the first element of `num`. The value of `cn` now represents this length. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
Code of the loop:
for ii in range(n - 1):
    if onum[ii] == onum[ii + 1]:
        ck += 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `r` is 0, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is `n - 1`, `cn` is the length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the first element of `num`, and `ii` is 0. If the current value of `onum[ii]` is equal to the current value of `onum[ii + 1]`, then `ck` is 2. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `r` is 0, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 2 * 10^5, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is `n - 1`, `cn` is the length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the first element of `num`, and `ii` is `n`. If the last two elements of `onum` are equal, `ck` is increased by 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `r` is 0, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 2 * 10^5, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is `n - 1`, `cn` is the length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the first element of `num`, and `ii` is `n - 1`. If the last two elements of `onum` are equal, `ck` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
