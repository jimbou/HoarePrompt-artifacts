The value of `cn` is incremented by `ck`, which is a value between 1 and `n`. The previous value of `cn` was the number of consecutive equal elements from the start of `num`. Since `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, it means that all elements in `num` are equal. Therefore, `cn` is equal to the length of `num`. After incrementing `cn` by `ck`, its new value is `cn + ck`.

The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`num` is a list of integers, `n` is an integer, `cn` is the length of `num` plus a value between 1 and `n`, `ck` is a value between 1 and `n`, `f` is 1, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, and `symb1` is equal to `symb2`.**
