Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, r is 1, stdin contains t - 3 test cases, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, num is a list of n integers between 1 and n, onum is a reversed copy of num, ck is the length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the first element of num, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the last element of num, i is n - 1, cn is twice the length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the first element of num if the first element of num is equal to the last element of num, j is n - 1, f is 1.**

The code snippet provided modifies the state of several variables. The first line creates a reversed copy of the list `num` and assigns it to `onum`. The second line initializes `cn` to 1, and the third line initializes `ck` to 1. The fourth line initializes `f` to 1. The fifth line assigns the first element of `num` to `symb1`, and the sixth line assigns the first element of `onum` (which is the last element of `num`) to `symb2`. 

Note that the values of `t`, `r`, `n`, `num`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet.
