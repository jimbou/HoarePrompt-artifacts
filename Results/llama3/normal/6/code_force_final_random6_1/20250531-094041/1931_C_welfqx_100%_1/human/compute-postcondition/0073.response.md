Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, r is 1, stdin contains t - 3 test cases, n is 1, num is a list of n integers between 1 and n, onum is a reversed copy of num, ck is the length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the first element of num, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the last element of num, i is n - 1, cn is twice the length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the first element of num if the first element of num is equal to the last element of num, j is n - 1 and f is 1, and 0 is being printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, but the program skips to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. The loop will continue to execute with the same values for all variables.
