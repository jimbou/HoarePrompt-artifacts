Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `r` is 1, stdin contains `t - 3` or `t - 4` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `num` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `ck` is the length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the first element of `num`, the first element of `num` (`symb1`) is equal to the last element of `num` (`symb2`), `i` is `n - 1`, `cn` is `3 * ck + k` if the first element of `num` is equal to the last element of `num` and the `k`th iteration of the loop is the last iteration where `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, `j` is `n - 1`, `f` is 1, and `ii` is `n - 1**.

In this output state, the value of `cn` has been updated to `3 * ck + k` because the first element of `num` is equal to the last element of `num` and the `k`th iteration of the loop is the last iteration where `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
