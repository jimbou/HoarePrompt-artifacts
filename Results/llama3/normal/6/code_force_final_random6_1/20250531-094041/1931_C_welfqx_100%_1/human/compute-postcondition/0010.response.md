To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1, and `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5.

To execute the loop again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `r` is 0, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, `num` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `j` is 2**
