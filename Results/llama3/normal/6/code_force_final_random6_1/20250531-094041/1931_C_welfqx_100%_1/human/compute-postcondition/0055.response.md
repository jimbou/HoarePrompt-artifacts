The code prints the difference between the length of the list `num` and the maximum of two values: `cn` and `ck`. 

`cn` is twice the length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the first element of `num`, but only if the first element of `num` is equal to the last element of `num`. 

`ck` is the length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the first element of `num`.

Since `n` is the length of the list `num`, `n - max(cn, ck)` will be the difference between the length of the list `num` and the maximum of these two values.

Output: **n - max(2 * length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the first element of num if the first element of num is equal to the last element of num, length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the first element of num)**
