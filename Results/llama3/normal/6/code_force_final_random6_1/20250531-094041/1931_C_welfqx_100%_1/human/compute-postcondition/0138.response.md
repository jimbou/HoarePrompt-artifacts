Output State: **`num` is a list of integers, `n` is at least 3, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `i` is 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the first two elements of `num` are equal, then `cn` is 2 and `ck` is 1. Otherwise, `cn` is 1, `ck` is 1**.

The code only contains a `break` statement, which does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, all the variables maintain their previous values. The `break` statement only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, but does not affect the values of the variables.
