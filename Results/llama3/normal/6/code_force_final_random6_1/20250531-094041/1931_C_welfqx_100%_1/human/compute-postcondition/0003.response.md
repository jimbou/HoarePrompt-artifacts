The only variables in the loop head are variables  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If n is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, r is 0, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, f is 1, num is a list of n integers between 1 and n does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 1 and j is now 0. 
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, r is 0, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, f is 1, num is a list of n integers between 1 and n, j is 0**
