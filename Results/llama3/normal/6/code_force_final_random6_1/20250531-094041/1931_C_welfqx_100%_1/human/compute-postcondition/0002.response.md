Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, r is 0, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, f is 1, num is a list of n integers between 1 and n**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `t` remains unchanged, still an integer between 1 and 10^4. The value of `r` also remains unchanged, still 0. The number of test cases in stdin has decreased by 1, now containing `t - 1` test cases. The value of `n` has been updated to an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, which was read from the input. The value of `f` has been set to 1. The `num` variable now holds a list of `n` integers, each between 1 and `n`, which were also read from the input.
