Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, r is 1, stdin contains t - 3 test cases, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, num is a list of n integers between 1 and n, onum is a reversed copy of num, ck is the length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the first element of num, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the last element of num, i is n - 1, cn is 2 * ck + k if the first element of num is equal to the last element of num and the kth iteration of the loop is the last iteration where num[i] is equal to num[i + 1], j is n - 1, f is 1.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations. The value of `i` is now `n - 1`, indicating that the loop has reached its termination condition. The value of `cn` depends on whether the first element of `num` is equal to the last element of `num`. If they are equal, `cn` is `2 * ck + k`, where `k` is the last iteration where `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`. If they are not equal, `cn` remains unchanged from its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop head and body.
