To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 2 (since the loop iterates from 0 to `n-2`). 

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `r` is 2, stdin contains `t - 4` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `num` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `ck` is the length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the first element of `num`, if the first element of `num` (`symb1`) is equal to the last element of `num` (`symb2`), then `i` is `n - 1`, `cn` is `3 * ck + k` if the `k`th iteration of the loop is the last iteration where `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, `j` is 0, `f` is 1, and `ii` is `n - 1`, and the number of elements to be removed from the list `num` to make it a list of equal elements is printed, which is `n - max(cn, ck)`**
