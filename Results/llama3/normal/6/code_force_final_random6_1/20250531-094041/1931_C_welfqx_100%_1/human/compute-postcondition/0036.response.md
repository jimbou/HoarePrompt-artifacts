The only objects in the loop head are variables  ii and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 2, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `ii` is `n - 2`. So for the loop to be executed  the value of `n` must be at least 2 and `ii` is 0.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `r` is 0, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `ck` is 1, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is `n - 1`, `cn` is the length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the first element of `num`, and `ii` is 0**
