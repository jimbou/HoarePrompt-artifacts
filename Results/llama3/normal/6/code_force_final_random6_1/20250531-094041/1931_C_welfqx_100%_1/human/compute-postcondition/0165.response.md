Output State: **t is 0, r is t, stdin is empty, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, f is 1, num is a list of n integers between 1 and n, j is n - 1, onum is a reversed copy of num, ck is the length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the first element of num, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the last element of num, i is n - 1, and ii is n - 1. If the first element of num is equal to the last element of num, then cn is twice the length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the first element of num. The difference between the number of elements in the list num and the maximum of cn and ck is being printed.**

This output state represents the final state of the program after the loop has executed all its iterations. The loop has processed all test cases, and the input stream is empty. The variables within the loop have reached their final values, with `t` being 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed, and `r` being equal to the initial value of `t`, indicating that the loop has executed `t` times. The other variables within the loop have reached their final values based on the last test case processed.
