Postcondition: ***`num` is a list of integers, `n` is at least 2, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`. If the first two elements of `num` are equal, then `cn` is 2 and `ck` is 1. Otherwise, `cn` is 1, `ck` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
