Postcondition: ***`num` is a list of integers, `n` is greater than 1, `cn` is the number of consecutive equal elements from the start of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`. If the current value of `onum[ii]` is equal to the current value of `onum[ii + 1]`, then `ck` is 2 and `f` is 1. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, with `ck` being 1 and `f` being 1.***
