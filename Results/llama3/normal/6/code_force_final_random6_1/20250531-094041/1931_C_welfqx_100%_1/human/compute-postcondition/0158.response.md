Postcondition: ***`num` is a list of integers, `n` is greater than 1, `cn` is the number of consecutive equal elements from the start of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `ii` is incremented by 1, `f` is 1, and `ck` is either 2, 3, or 4 if the last two elements of `onum` are equal, otherwise `ck` is either 1, 2, or 3 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
