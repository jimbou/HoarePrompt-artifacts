The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be at least 3.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `r` is 0, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `cn` is 1 or 2 depending on whether the first two elements of `num` are equal or not, `ck` is 1, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is 1, and either the first two elements of `num` are equal or the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
