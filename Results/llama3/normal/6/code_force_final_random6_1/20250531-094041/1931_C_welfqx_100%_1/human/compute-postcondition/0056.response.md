The code prints the difference between the number of elements in the list `num` and the maximum of `cn` and `ck`. Where `cn` is twice the length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the first element of `num` if the first element of `num` is equal to the last element of `num`, and `ck` is the length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the first element of `num`. The value of `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, and the values of `cn` and `ck` depend on the specific elements in the list `num`.

Output: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `r` is 0, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `ck` is the length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the first element of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is `n - 1`. If the first element of `num` is equal to the last element of `num`, then `cn` is twice the length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the first element of `num`. The difference between the number of elements in the list `num` and the maximum of `cn` and `ck` is being printed**
