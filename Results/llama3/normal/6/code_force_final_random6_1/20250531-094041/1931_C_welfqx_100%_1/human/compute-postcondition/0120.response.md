The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j`. If `j` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is some value, and `n` is some value greater than `j`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1.

State: **The number of elements to be removed from the list num to make it a list of equal elements is printed, which is n - max(cn, ck), if num[j] is not equal to num[j + 1], otherwise no change is made, j is incremented by 1**
