Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, r is 0, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, f is either 0 or 1, num is a list of n integers between 1 and n, j is n - 1. If n is 1 or f is 1, then the rest of the code inside the loop is skipped for the current iteration only.***
