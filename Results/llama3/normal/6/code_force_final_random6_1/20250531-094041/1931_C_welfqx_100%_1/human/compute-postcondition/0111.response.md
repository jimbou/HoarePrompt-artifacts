The only variable in the loop head is variable r, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable r and t. If r is less than t, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, r is 1 and t is an integer between 1 and 10^4. For the loop to execute again, r must be increased by 1, so r is 2 and for the loop to execute again t must be greater than 2.
State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4, r is 2, stdin contains t - 3 or t - 4 test cases, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, num is a list of n integers between 1 and n, onum is a reversed copy of num, ck is the length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the first element of num, if the first element of num (symb1) is equal to the last element of num (symb2), then i is n - 1, cn is 3 * ck + k if the kth iteration of the loop is the last iteration where num[i] is equal to num[i + 1], j is n - 1, f is 1, and ii is n - 1, and the number of elements to be removed from the list num to make it a list of equal elements is printed, which is n - max(cn, ck)**
