Output State: **`num` is a list of integers, `n` is at least 3, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `i` is 2. If the first two elements of `num` are equal, then `cn` is 2 and `ck` is 1. Otherwise, `cn` is 1 and `ck` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `num`, `n`, `symb1`, `symb2`, `onum`, and `i` remain unchanged. The `break` statement only affects the control flow, causing the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement. The conditions related to `cn` and `ck` are updated based on the first two elements of `num`. If they are equal, `cn` is 2 and `ck` is 1. Otherwise, `cn` is 1 and `ck` is 1.
