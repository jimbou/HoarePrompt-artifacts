The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is `n - 1` does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 1.

State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, r is 1, stdin contains t - 3 test cases, n is an integer greater than 1, num is a list of n integers between 1 and n, onum is a reversed copy of num, ck is the length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the first element of num, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the last element of num, i is 0, cn is twice the length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the first element of num if the first element of num is equal to the last element of num, j is n - 1, f is 1**
