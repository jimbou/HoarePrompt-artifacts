To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `r` is 0, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `cn` is 1, `ck` is 1, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is 0**
