Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `r` is 0, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `cn` is 2 or 3 depending on whether the first two elements of `num` are equal or not, `ck` is 1, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is 1, and either the first two elements of `num` are equal or the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The value of `cn` is incremented by 1. Since `cn` was either 1 or 2 depending on whether the first two elements of `num` are equal or not, it is now either 2 or 3. The states of the other variables are not affected.
