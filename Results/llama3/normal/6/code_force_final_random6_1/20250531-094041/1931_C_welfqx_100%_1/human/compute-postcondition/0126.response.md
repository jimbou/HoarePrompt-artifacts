Output: **The number of elements to be removed from the list num to make it a list of equal elements is printed, which is n - max(cn, ck). If num[j] is not equal to num[j + 1], then j is incremented by 1 and f is set to 0. If num[j] is equal to num[j + 1], then no change is made. The current value of n is 1 or the current value of f is 1, and 0 is printed**
