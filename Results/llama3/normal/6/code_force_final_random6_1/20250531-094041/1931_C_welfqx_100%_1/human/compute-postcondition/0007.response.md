The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `r` is 0, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, `num` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `j` is 1**
