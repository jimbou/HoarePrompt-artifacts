Output State: **`num` is a list of integers, `n` is greater than 1, `cn` is the number of consecutive equal elements from the start of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `ii` is incremented by 1, `f` is 1, and `ck` is either 2, 3, or 4**

In this output state, the value of `ck` has been incremented by 1, so it can now be either 2, 3, or 4. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
