Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `r` is 0, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `ck` is 2, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is `n - 1`, `cn` is the length of the longest contiguous sequence of equal elements starting from the first element of `num`, and `ii` is 0. The current value of `onum[ii]` is equal to the current value of `onum[ii + 1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `ck` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
