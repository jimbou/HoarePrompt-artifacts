Postcondition: ***num is a list of integers, n is an integer, cn is the number of consecutive equal elements from the start of num, ck is a value between 1 and n, f is 1, symb1 is the first element of num, symb2 is the last element of num, onum is a reversed copy of num. If the first and last elements of num are equal, then cn is the length of num plus a value between 1 and n. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
