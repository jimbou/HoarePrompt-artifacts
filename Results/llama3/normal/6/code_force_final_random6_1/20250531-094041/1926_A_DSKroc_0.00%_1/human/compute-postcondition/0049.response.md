Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 32 (inclusive), `q` is 2, `s` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `i` is the third character in `s`. If `i` is 'A', then `ac` is 2 and `bc` is 1. If `i` is not 'A', then `ac` is 0 and `bc` is 3.**

In this output state, the value of `bc` has been incremented by 1. If `i` is 'A', then `bc` is now 1, and if `i` is not 'A', then `bc` is now 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
