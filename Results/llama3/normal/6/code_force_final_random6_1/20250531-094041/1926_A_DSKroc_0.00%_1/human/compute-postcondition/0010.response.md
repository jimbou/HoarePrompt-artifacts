Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32 (inclusive), `q` is 0, `s` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `i` is the second character of `s` (either A or B), if `i` is 'A', then `ac` is 2 and `bc` is 0, if `i` is not 'A', then `ac` is 1 and `bc` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `ac` has been incremented by 1. If `i` is 'A', then `ac` is now 2, and if `i` is not 'A', then `ac` is now 1. The values of the other variables remain the same.
