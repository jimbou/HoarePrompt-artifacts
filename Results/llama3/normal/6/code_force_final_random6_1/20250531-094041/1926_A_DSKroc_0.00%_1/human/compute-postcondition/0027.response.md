Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32 (inclusive), `q` is 1, `s` is a string of length 4 consisting of letters A and B, `ac` is either the number of 'A's in `s` plus 2 if the first character in the string `s` is 'A', or the number of 'A's in `s` plus 1 if the first character in the string `s` is not 'A', `bc` is either the number of 'B's in `s` if the first character in the string `s` is 'A', or the number of 'B's in `s` plus 1 if the first character in the string `s` is not 'A', `stdin` contains `t-3` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.**

In this output state, the value of `ac` has been incremented by 1. If the first character of `s` is 'A', then `ac` is now the number of 'A's in `s` plus 2. If the first character of `s` is not 'A', then `ac` is now the number of 'A's in `s` plus 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
