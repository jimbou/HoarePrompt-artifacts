Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32 (inclusive), `q` is 1, `s` is a string of length 4 consisting of letters A and B, `stdin` contains `t-3` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. If the first character in the string `s` is 'A', then `ac` is the number of 'A's in `s` plus 1 and `bc` is the number of 'B's in `s` plus 1. If the first character in the string `s` is not 'A', then `ac` is the number of 'A's in `s` and `bc` is the number of 'B's in `s` plus 2.**

In this output state, the value of `bc` has been incremented by 1, regardless of the first character in the string `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.
