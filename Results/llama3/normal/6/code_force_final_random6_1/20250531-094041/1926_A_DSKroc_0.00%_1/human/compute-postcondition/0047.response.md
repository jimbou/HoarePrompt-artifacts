To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `s`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the second character in `s`, and `s` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to move to the next character in `s`. Since `i` is currently the second character, it will move to the third character in `s`.

The state of `s` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

The other variables `t`, `q`, `ac`, and `bc` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 32 (inclusive), `q` is 2, `s` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `i` is the third character in `s`. If `i` is 'A', then `ac` is 2 and `bc` is 0. If `i` is not 'A', then `ac` is 0 and `bc` is 2.**
