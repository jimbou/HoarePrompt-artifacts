Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32 (inclusive), `q` is 0, `s` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `i` is the third character of `s` (either A or B). If `i` is 'A', then `ac` is 2 and `bc` is 1. If `i` is not 'A', then `ac` is 0 and `bc` is 3.**

In this output state, the value of `bc` has been incremented by 1, regardless of whether `i` is 'A' or not. The other variables remain unchanged.
