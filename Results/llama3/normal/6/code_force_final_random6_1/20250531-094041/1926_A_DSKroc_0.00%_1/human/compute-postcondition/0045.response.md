Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 32 (inclusive), `q` is 2, `s` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `i` is the second character in `s`. If `i` is 'A', then `ac` is 1 and `bc` is 1. If `i` is not 'A', then `ac` is 0 and `bc` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `bc` has been incremented by 1. If `i` is 'A', then `bc` is now 1. If `i` is not 'A', then `bc` is now 2. The values of the other variables remain the same.
