Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32 (inclusive), `q` is 1, `s` is a string of length 3 consisting of letters A and B, `ac` is either the number of 'A's in `s` plus 2 or the number of 'A's in `s` plus 1, `bc` is either the number of 'B's in `s` plus 3 or the number of 'B's in `s` plus 3, `stdin` contains `t-3` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.**

In this output state, the value of `bc` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ac` and `bc` depends on the first character of the string `s`. If the first character is 'A', then `ac` is the number of 'A's in `s` plus 2 and `bc` is the number of 'B's in `s` plus 3. If the first character is not 'A', then `ac` is the number of 'A's in `s` plus 1 and `bc` is the number of 'B's in `s` plus 3.
