To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_cases` list. If `test_cases` has at least one test case, the loop will execute. 

Since each test case is a list of two elements, the first element is a list of three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and the second element is a list of `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n`, we can adjust the states as follows:

- `n` must be a positive integer (at least 1) to ensure the loop can execute.
- `x` and `y` can be any integers, but for the loop to execute, they must be present in the test case.
- `arr` must be a list of at least `n` integers.

At the end of the last iteration, `results` is still an empty list.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `n` is a positive integer, `x` and `y` are integers, `arr` is a list of at least `n` integers, `results` is an empty list**
