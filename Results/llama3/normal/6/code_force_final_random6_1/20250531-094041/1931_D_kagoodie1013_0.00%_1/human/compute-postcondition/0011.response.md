To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_cases` list. If the list has at least 2 test cases, the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `test_cases` has at least 1 test case.

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, the `test_cases` list must have at least 2 test cases.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `n` is a positive integer, `x` and `y` are integers, `arr` is an empty list, `results` is a list with one element which is equal to the sum of the values of `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` for the keys `mod_x_key` and `mod_y_key` respectively plus `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)` plus `mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0)` plus ... plus `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with a key `mod_x_key` and a value of 1 plus the value of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0)`, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with a key `mod_y_key` and a value of 1 plus the value of `mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0)`, `num` is the last integer in the list, `mod_x` is `-num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `mod_x_key` is `num % x`, `mod_y_key` is `num % y`**
