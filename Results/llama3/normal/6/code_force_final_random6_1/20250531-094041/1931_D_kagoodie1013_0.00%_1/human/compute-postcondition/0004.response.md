Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, n is a positive integer, x and y are integers, arr is a list of at least n integers that must have at least 1 integer, results is an empty list, count is equal to the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x_key and mod_y_key respectively, mod_x_map is a dictionary with a key mod_x_key and a value of 1, mod_y_map is a dictionary with a key mod_y_key and a value of 1, num is the first integer in the list**.

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The code snippet modifies the count variable by adding the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x_key and mod_y_key respectively. The mod_x_map and mod_y_map dictionaries are updated with a new key-value pair, where the key is the remainder of the first integer in the list divided by x and y respectively, and the value is 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
