The only variables in the loop head are variables  n, x, y, arr and test_cases, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the test_cases.  If the list has at least 3 test cases the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, test_cases has at least 2 test cases, n is a positive integer, x and y are integers, arr is a list that must have at least n elements, results is a list with two elements where the first element is equal to the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x_key and mod_y_key respectively plus mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0) plus mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0) plus ... plus mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0) and the second element is equal to count, mod_x_map is a dictionary with mod_x_key as a key and n as its value, mod_y_map is a dictionary with mod_y_key as a key and n as its value, num is the nth integer in the list, mod_x is -num % x, mod_y is num % y, mod_x_key is num % x, mod_y_key is num % y, count is mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0) + mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0) + ... + mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0) (n times). So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 test cases.
State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, n is a positive integer, x and y are integers, arr is a list that must have at least n elements, results is a list with two elements where the first element is equal to the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x_key and mod_y_key respectively plus mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0) plus mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0) plus ... plus mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0) and the second element is equal to count, mod_x_map is a dictionary with mod_x_key as a key and n as its value, mod_y_map is a dictionary with mod_y_key as a key and n as its value, num is the nth integer in the list, mod_x is -num % x, mod_y is num % y, mod_x_key is num % x, mod_y_key is num % y, count is mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0) + mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0) + ... + mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0) (n times)**
