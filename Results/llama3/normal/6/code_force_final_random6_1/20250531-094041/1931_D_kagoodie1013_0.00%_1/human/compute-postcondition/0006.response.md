Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, n is a positive integer, x and y are integers, arr is a list of at least 2 integers that must have at least 2 integers, results is an empty list, count is equal to the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x_key and mod_y_key respectively plus mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0), mod_x_map is a dictionary with a key mod_x_key and a value of 1 plus the value of mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0), mod_y_map is a dictionary with a key mod_y_key and a value of 1 plus the value of mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0), num is the second integer in the list, mod_x is -num % x, mod_y is num % y, mod_x_key is num % x, mod_y_key is num % y**

The code modifies the values of `count`, `mod_x_map`, and `mod_y_map` based on the values of `num`, `x`, and `y`. The `mod_x` and `mod_y` variables are calculated using the modulo operator, and the `mod_x_key` and `mod_y_key` variables are assigned the values of `num % x` and `num % y`, respectively. The `count` variable is incremented by the sum of the values of `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` for the keys `mod_x_key` and `mod_y_key`, respectively. The `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` dictionaries are updated with the new keys and values. The other variables remain unchanged.
