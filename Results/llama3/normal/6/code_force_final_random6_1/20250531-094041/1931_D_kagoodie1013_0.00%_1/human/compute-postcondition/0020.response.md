Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, n is a positive integer, x and y are integers, arr is a list that must have at least n elements, results is a list with two elements where the first element is equal to the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x_key and mod_y_key respectively plus mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0) plus mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0) plus ... plus mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0) and the second element is equal to count, mod_x_map is a dictionary with mod_x_key as a key and n as its value, mod_y_map is a dictionary with mod_y_key as a key and n as its value, num is the nth integer in the list, mod_x is -num % x, mod_y is num % y, mod_x_key is num % x, mod_y_key is num % y, count is mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0) + mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0) + ... + mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0) (n times)**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of results now has two elements, where the first element is the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x_key and mod_y_key respectively plus the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x and mod_y respectively, repeated n times. The second element is equal to the count, which is the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x and mod_y respectively, repeated n times. The other variables remain unchanged.
