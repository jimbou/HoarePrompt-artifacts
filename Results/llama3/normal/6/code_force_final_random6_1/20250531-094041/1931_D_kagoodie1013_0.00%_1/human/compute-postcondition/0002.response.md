Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, n is a positive integer, x and y are integers, arr is a list of at least n integers, results is an empty list, count is 0, mod_x_map is an empty dictionary, mod_y_map is an empty dictionary**

The code initializes three new variables: `count`, `mod_x_map`, and `mod_y_map`. The `count` variable is set to 0, and the `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` variables are initialized as empty dictionaries. The rest of the variables (`test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, and `results`) remain unchanged, retaining their initial values.
