Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of two elements: the first element is a list of three integers n, x, and y, and the second element is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. `results` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the initial state of `test_cases` remains unchanged, as the code does not modify it. However, a new variable `results` is introduced and initialized as an empty list.
