According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If the list has at least 2 integers the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least 1 integer, `num` is the first integer in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 integers and the `num` is the second integer in the list.
State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `n` is a positive integer, `x` and `y` are integers, `arr` is a list of at least 2 integers that must have at least 2 integers, `results` is an empty list, `count` is equal to the sum of the values of `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` for the keys `mod_x_key` and `mod_y_key` respectively, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with a key `mod_x_key` and a value of 1, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with a key `mod_y_key` and a value of 1, `num` is the second integer in the list**
