Correctness: **False**.

The program is incorrect because it counts the pairs where `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x` and `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y` separately, but it does not ensure that the same pair of indices `(i, j)` satisfies both conditions.

For example, consider the input `n = 3, x = 2, y = 3, arr = [1, 2, 3]`. The program will count the pair `(1, 2)` because `1 + 2 = 3` is divisible by `2`, and it will also count the pair `(1, 3)` because `1 - 3 = -2` is divisible by `3`. However, the pair `(1, 2)` does not satisfy the condition `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`, and the pair `(1, 3)` does not satisfy the condition `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.

To fix this, the program should only count the pairs where both conditions are satisfied, which can be done by using a single map to store the counts of `num % x` and `num % y` for each number in the array, and then iterating over the map to count the pairs that satisfy both conditions.
