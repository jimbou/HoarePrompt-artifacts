The only variable in the loop head is variable  num and arr, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the arr.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, arr has at least 1 element, num is the first integer in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the num is the second integer in the list.
State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, n is a positive integer, x and y are integers, arr is a list that must have at least 2 elements, results is a list with one element which is equal to the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the keys mod_x_key and mod_y_key respectively plus mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0) plus mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0) plus ... plus mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0), mod_x_map is a dictionary with mod_x_key as a key and 1 as its value, mod_y_map is a dictionary with mod_y_key as a key and 1 as its value, num is the second integer in the list, mod_x is -num % x, mod_y is num % y, mod_x_key is num % x, mod_y_key is num % y, count is mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)**
