To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `num` and `arr`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `arr` has at least one more integer. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least 2 integers, and `num` is the second integer in the list.

For the loop to execute again, `arr` must have at least 3 integers, and `num` must be the third integer in the list.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `n` is a positive integer, `x` and `y` are integers, `arr` is a list of at least 3 integers, `results` is an empty list, `count` is equal to the sum of the values of `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` for the keys `mod_x_key` and `mod_y_key` respectively plus `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with a key `mod_x_key` and a value of 1 plus the value of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0)`, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with a key `mod_y_key` and a value of 1 plus the value of `mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0)`, `num` is the third integer in the list, `mod_x` is -num % x, `mod_y` is num % y, `mod_x_key` is num % x, `mod_y_key` is num % y**
