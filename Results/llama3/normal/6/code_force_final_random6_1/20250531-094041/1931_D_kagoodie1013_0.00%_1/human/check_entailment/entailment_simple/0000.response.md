Reasoning: 
The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array. A beautiful pair is defined as a pair of indices (i, j) where a_i + a_j is divisible by x and a_i - a_j is divisible by y.

The program uses two dictionaries, mod_x_map and mod_y_map, to store the counts of numbers in the array that have the same remainder when divided by x and y, respectively. It then iterates over the array, for each number, it calculates the remainder when divided by x and y, and increments the count of beautiful pairs by the sum of the counts of numbers that have the same remainder when divided by x and y.

However, the program has a logical error. The condition for a beautiful pair is that a_i + a_j is divisible by x and a_i - a_j is divisible by y. But in the program, it checks if -num % x is in mod_x_map and num % y is in mod_y_map. This is incorrect because it should check if (x - num % x) % x is in mod_x_map and (y - num % y) % y is in mod_y_map.

Correctness: **False**
