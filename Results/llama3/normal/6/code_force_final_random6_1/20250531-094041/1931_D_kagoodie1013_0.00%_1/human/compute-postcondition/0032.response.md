Output State: **The program returns a list of integers where each integer is equal to the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the corresponding keys, repeated n times, plus the sum of the values of mod_x_map and mod_y_map for the corresponding keys.**

In simpler terms, the program returns a list of integers where each integer represents the total count of occurrences of certain modulo values in the list `arr`, repeated `n` times, plus the count of occurrences of those modulo values. The modulo values are calculated using the integers `x` and `y`, and the counts are stored in the dictionaries `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`.
