Output State: **n, m, k, and d are positive integers, rows is a list of lists of non-negative integers, costs is a list of integers, total_costs is an empty list, stdin contains no input**.

In this output state, the values of n, m, k, and d are updated to the positive integers provided as input. The rows variable is now a list of lists of non-negative integers, where each inner list represents a row of integers. The costs variable is a list of integers, where each integer is the result of calling the func_1 function with a row from rows and the value of d. The total_costs variable is an empty list. Stdin is empty, as all input has been consumed by the code.
