Reasoning: 
The given program is designed to solve the problem of minimizing the total cost of installing supports for building k bridges on consecutive rows of a river, where each row has a certain depth and the distance between supports cannot exceed a certain value d. The program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2.

Func_1 takes a row and a distance d as input and modifies the row by setting the first element to 1 and incrementing each subsequent element by 2 times its index, up to the d'th element. It then creates a min heap from the first d elements of the row and iteratively updates the remaining elements of the row by adding 1 to the sum of the current element and the smallest element from the heap that is not outdated. The function returns the last element of the modified row.

Func_2 reads the input, which includes the number of rows (n), the number of columns (m), the number of bridges (k), and the maximum distance between supports (d). It then reads the depths of the river cells for each row and calculates the costs for each row using func_1. The function then calculates the total costs for each possible set of k consecutive rows and prints the minimum total cost.

The program correctly implements the problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. It correctly calculates the costs for each row, calculates the total costs for each possible set of k consecutive rows, and prints the minimum total cost.

Correctness: **True**
