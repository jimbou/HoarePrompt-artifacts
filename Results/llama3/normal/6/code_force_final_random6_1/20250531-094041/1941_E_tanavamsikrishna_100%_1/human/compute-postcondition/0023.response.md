To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `e` and `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `(e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `e[1]` is between `i - (d + 3)` and `i - (d + 2)` (inclusive), and a new tuple with an index smaller than or equal to `i - (d + 3)` has been added to `min_heap`. For the loop to execute again, the new top element of `min_heap` (which will be assigned to `e` after `heappop`) must have an index less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`. 

Since we cannot adjust the value of `i`, we need to adjust the state of `min_heap` so that the new top element has an index less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`. This can be achieved by ensuring that the new tuple added to `min_heap` has an index less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`row` is a list of non-negative integers where the first element is 1 and each subsequent element is increased by 2 times its index, except for the element at index `i` which is now `e[0] + row[i] + 1`, `d` is a positive integer such that `d` is equal to `len(row) - 1`, `i` is greater than `d + 3`, `min_heap` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `row[:d]` and its index, and `min_heap` is a valid min heap with no elements having an index less than or equal to `i - (d + 3)`, except for the newly added tuple `(row[i], i)` and a new tuple with an index less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`, and the tuple `e` where `e[1]` is between `i - (d + 3)` and `i - (d + 2)` (inclusive)**
