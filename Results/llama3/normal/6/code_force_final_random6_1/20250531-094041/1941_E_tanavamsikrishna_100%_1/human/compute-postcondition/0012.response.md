To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `min_heap`, `i`, and `d`.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if the index of the popped element from `min_heap` is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `d`, so `i - (d + 2)` is `-2`. To ensure the loop can execute again, the index of the popped element from `min_heap` must be less than or equal to `-2`. However, since the index is always non-negative, this condition cannot be met. Therefore, we need to adjust the value of `i` to be greater than `d + 2`.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`row` is a list of non-negative integers where the first element is 1 and each subsequent element is increased by 2 times its index, `d` is a positive integer such that `d` is equal to `len(row) - 1`, `i` is greater than `d + 2`, `min_heap` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `row[:d]` and its index, and `min_heap` is a valid min heap.**
