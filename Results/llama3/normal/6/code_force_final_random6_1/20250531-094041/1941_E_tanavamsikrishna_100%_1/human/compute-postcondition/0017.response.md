Output State: **row is a list of non-negative integers where the first element is 1 and each subsequent element is increased by 2 times its index, except for the element at index i which is now e[0] + row[i] + 1, d is a positive integer such that d is equal to len(row) - 1, i is greater than d + 2, min_heap is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from row[:d] and its index, and min_heap is a valid min heap with no elements having an index less than or equal to i - (d + 2), except for the newly added tuple (row[i], i) and the tuple e.**

In this output state, the value of `row[i]` has been updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`, and two new tuples have been added to `min_heap`: `e` and `(row[i], i)`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
