The variables in the loop head are min_heap, i, and d. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable min_heap and i. If the min heap contains at least one tuple with an index less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the min heap contains at least one tuple with an index less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`, i is incremented by 1, and d remains unchanged. For the loop to execute again, the min heap must still contain at least one tuple with an index less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`, which means the index of the tuple must be less than or equal to `(i + 1) - (d + 2)`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **The min heap contains at least one tuple with an index less than or equal to `(i + 1) - (d + 2)`, the value of row[i] is to be determined in the next iteration, i is incremented by 1, d remains unchanged.**
