To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `d`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `len(row)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is greater than `d + 2`, and `d` is equal to `len(row) - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1.

State: **row is a list of non-negative integers where the first element is 1 and each subsequent element is increased by 2 times its index, except for the element at index i which is now e[0] + row[i] + 1, d is a positive integer such that d is equal to len(row) - 1, i is greater than d + 3, min_heap is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from row[:d] and its index, and min_heap is a valid min heap with no elements having an index less than or equal to i - (d + 3), except for the newly added tuple (row[i], i) and the tuple e.**
