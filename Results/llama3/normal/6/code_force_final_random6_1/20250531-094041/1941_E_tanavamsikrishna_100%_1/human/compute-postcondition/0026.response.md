Output State: **The min heap contains the newly added tuple (row[i], i) and possibly some tuples with indices greater than i - (d + 2). The value of row[i] is e[0] + row[i] + 1, where e is the last tuple popped from the min heap. The values of d and i remain unchanged.**

In this output state, the min heap has been modified to include the new tuple (row[i], i) and possibly some tuples with indices greater than i - (d + 2). The value of row[i] has been updated to e[0] + row[i] + 1, where e is the last tuple popped from the min heap. The values of d and i remain unchanged, as they were not modified by the code.
