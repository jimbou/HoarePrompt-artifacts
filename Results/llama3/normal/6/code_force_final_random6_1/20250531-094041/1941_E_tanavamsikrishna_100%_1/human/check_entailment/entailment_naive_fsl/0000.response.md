Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the `func_1` function, where the line `row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1` is incorrect. This line is trying to update the cost of the current cell based on the minimum cost of the previous cells, but it's doing so incorrectly.

The correct way to update the cost would be to consider the minimum cost of the previous cells that are within the distance `d`. However, the current implementation is not doing this correctly.

For example, consider the input `row = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]` and `d = 4`. The correct output should be `4`, but the program outputs `5`.

To fix this issue, the `func_1` function needs to be modified to correctly update the cost of each cell based on the minimum cost of the previous cells within the distance `d`.
