Output State: **`row` is a list of non-negative integers where the first element is 1 and each subsequent element is increased by 2 times its index, `d` is a positive integer such that `d` is equal to `len(row) - 1`, `i` is greater than `d + 2`, `min_heap` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `row[:d]` and its index, and `min_heap` is a valid min heap with at least one element having an index less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`**

The code `pass` does not have any impact on the program, so all the variables and their values remain the same. The output state is the same as the initial state.
