Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n, m, k, and d are positive integers, rows is a list of lists of non-negative integers, costs is a list of integers, total_costs is an empty list, stdin contains no input
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
    total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n, m, k, and d are positive integers, rows is a list of lists of non-negative integers, costs is a list of at least k integers, total_costs is a list containing the sum of the first k integers in costs, stdin contains no input, i is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are positive integers, `rows` is a list of lists of non-negative integers, `costs` is a list of at least k+1 integers, `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of the first k+1 integers in `costs` and the sum of the next k integers in `costs` starting from index `i`, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are positive integers, `rows` is a list of lists of non-negative integers, `costs` is a list of at least k+2 integers, `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of the first k+2 integers in `costs`, the sum of the next k integers in `costs` starting from index `i+1`, and the sum of the next k integers in `costs` starting from index `i+1` where `i` is 2, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 2




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
