Output State: **n, m, k, and d are positive integers, rows is a list of lists of non-negative integers, costs is a list of integers, total_costs is a list containing the sum of every k integers in costs, stdin contains no input, i is len(costs) - (k - 1)**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

*   The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` remain positive integers.
*   The variable `rows` remains a list of lists of non-negative integers.
*   The variable `costs` remains a list of integers.
*   The variable `total_costs` becomes a list containing the sum of every `k` integers in `costs`.
*   The standard input `stdin` remains empty.
*   The loop counter `i` reaches its final value, which is `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.
