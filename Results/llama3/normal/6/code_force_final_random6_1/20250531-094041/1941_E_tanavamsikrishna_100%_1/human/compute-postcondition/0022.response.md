Output State: **`row` is a list of non-negative integers where the first element is 1 and each subsequent element is increased by 2 times its index, except for the element at index `i` which is now `e[0] + row[i] + 1`, `d` is a positive integer such that `d` is equal to `len(row) - 1`, `i` is greater than `d + 3`, `min_heap` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `row[:d]` and its index, and `min_heap` is a valid min heap with no elements having an index less than or equal to `i - (d + 3)`, except for the newly added tuple `(row[i], i)`, the tuple `e` where `e[1]` is between `i - (d + 3)` and `i - (d + 2)` (inclusive), and a new tuple with an index smaller than or equal to `i - (d + 3)`.**

The code does not modify any variables, so the output state remains the same as the initial state.
