Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of minimizing the total cost of installing supports for bridges on a river. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` takes a list of non-negative integers `row` and a positive integer `d` as input. It modifies the input list `row` by first setting the first element to 1 and incrementing each subsequent element by 2 times its index, up to the `d`th element. It then creates a min heap from the first `d` elements of `row` and iteratively updates the remaining elements of `row` by adding 1 to the sum of the current element and the smallest element from the heap that is not outdated (i.e., its index is not less than or equal to the current index minus `d` plus 2). The function returns the last element of the modified list `row`.

`func_2` takes no arguments and reads input from the standard input. It reads four positive integers `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`, and a list of lists of non-negative integers `rows`. It calculates the costs of installing supports for each row using `func_1` and stores them in a list `costs`. It then calculates the total costs of installing supports for `k` consecutive rows and stores them in a list `total_costs`. Finally, it prints the minimum total cost.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the algorithm described in the problem statement. The use of a min heap in `func_1` ensures that the smallest element from the heap is always chosen, which minimizes the total cost. The calculation of total costs in `func_2` is also correct, as it takes into account the costs of installing supports for `k` consecutive rows.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
