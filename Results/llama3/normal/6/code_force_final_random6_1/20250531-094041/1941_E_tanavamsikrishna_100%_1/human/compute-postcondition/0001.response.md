The only variables in the loop head are variables  i, costs and k, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `costs` and `k`. If the length of `costs` is at least `k`, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n, m, k, and d are positive integers, rows is a list of lists of non-negative integers, costs is a list of integers, total_costs is an empty list, stdin contains no input does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `costs` has at least `k` elements and i is now 0. 
State: **n, m, k, and d are positive integers, rows is a list of lists of non-negative integers, costs is a list of at least k integers, total_costs is an empty list, stdin contains no input, i is 0**
