Output State: **`row` is a list of non-negative integers where the first element is 1 and each subsequent element is increased by 2 times its index, `d` is a positive integer such that `d` is equal to `len(row) - 1`, `i` is greater than `d + 2`, `min_heap` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `row[:d]` and its index, and `min_heap` is a valid min heap.**

The code has no impact on the program, so all variables remain unchanged. The output state is the same as the initial state.
