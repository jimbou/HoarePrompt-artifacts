Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of minimizing the total cost of installing supports for bridges on a river. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` takes a list of non-negative integers `row` and a positive integer `d` as input. It modifies the first `d` elements of `row` by adding 2 times their index to each element. Then, it creates a min heap from the first `d` elements of `row` and their indices. It iterates over the remaining elements of `row`, updating the min heap and the elements of `row` based on the minimum value in the heap and the current element. Finally, it returns the last element of `row`, which represents the minimum cost of installing supports for a single bridge.

`func_2` takes no arguments and reads input from the standard input. It reads four positive integers `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`, and a list of lists of non-negative integers `rows`. It applies `func_1` to each row in `rows` to calculate the minimum cost of installing supports for each bridge. Then, it calculates the total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive bridges by summing the costs of each bridge. Finally, it prints the minimum total cost.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. The use of a min heap in `func_1` ensures that the minimum cost of installing supports for each bridge is calculated efficiently. The calculation of the total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive bridges in `func_2` is also correct.

However, there is a minor issue with the program. In `func_1`, the line `row[0] = 1` modifies the input list `row`. This is not a problem in this specific program, but it could be a problem if the input list is used elsewhere in the program. It would be better to create a copy of the input list before modifying it.

Correctness: **True**
