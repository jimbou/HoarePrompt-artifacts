Output State: **n, m, k, and d are positive integers, rows is a list of lists of non-negative integers, costs is a list of at least k integers, total_costs is a list containing the sum of the first k integers in costs, stdin contains no input, i is 0**

In this output state, the values of n, m, k, and d remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The rows and costs lists also remain unchanged. The total_costs list now contains the sum of the first k integers in the costs list. The stdin still contains no input, and the value of i remains 0.
