Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are positive integers, `rows` is a list of lists of non-negative integers, `costs` is a list of at least k+1 integers, `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of the first k+1 integers in `costs` and the sum of the next k integers in `costs` starting from index `i`, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `total_costs` has been updated to include the sum of the next k integers in `costs` starting from index `i`, which is 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
