The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and costs, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `costs`. If `i` is less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `costs` is a list of at least k integers. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and `costs` must have at least k+1 integers.
State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are positive integers, `rows` is a list of lists of non-negative integers, `costs` is a list of at least k+1 integers, `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of the first k+1 integers in `costs`, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 1**
