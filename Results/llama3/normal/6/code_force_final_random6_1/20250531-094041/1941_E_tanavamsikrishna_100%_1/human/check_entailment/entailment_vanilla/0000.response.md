Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem of minimizing the total cost of installing supports for building bridges on consecutive rows of a river. The program uses two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` calculates the minimum cost of installing supports for a single row. It initializes the first `d` elements of the row with a cost of 2, and then uses a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost of installing supports for the remaining elements in the row. The function returns the minimum cost of installing supports for the entire row.

`func_2` reads the input data, calculates the minimum cost of installing supports for each row using `func_1`, and then calculates the total cost of installing supports for all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows. The function prints the minimum total cost.

The program uses a min-heap to efficiently keep track of the minimum cost of installing supports for each row. The time complexity of the program is O(n*m*log(d)), where n is the number of rows, m is the number of columns, and d is the maximum distance between supports.

The program correctly implements the problem's constraints and requirements. It initializes the first and last elements of each row with a cost of 0, and ensures that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`. The program also correctly calculates the total cost of installing supports for all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
