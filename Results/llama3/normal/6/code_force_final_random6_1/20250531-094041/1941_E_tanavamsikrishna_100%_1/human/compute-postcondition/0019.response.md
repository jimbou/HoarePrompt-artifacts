To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `(e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)`.

1. `heappop(min_heap)` must return a tuple `(e[0], e[1])` where `e[1]` is the index of the element in `row`.
2. The condition `e[1] <= i - (d + 2)` must be true.

From the given state, we know:

* `i` is greater than `d + 3`.
* `min_heap` is a valid min heap with no elements having an index less than or equal to `i - (d + 3)`, except for the newly added tuple `(row[i], i)` and the tuple `e`.

To ensure the loop can execute the first time, we need to adjust the state of `e` (the tuple that will be popped from `min_heap`).

Since `e[1]` must be less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`, and `i` is greater than `d + 3`, we can conclude that `e[1]` must be less than `i - (d + 2)`.

However, we also know that `e` is a tuple that was added to `min_heap` along with the tuple `(row[i], i)`, and `min_heap` has no elements with an index less than or equal to `i - (d + 3)`. This means that `e[1]` must be greater than `i - (d + 3)`.

Combining these two conditions, we can conclude that `e[1]` must be between `i - (d + 3)` and `i - (d + 2)` (inclusive).

State: **`row` is a list of non-negative integers where the first element is 1 and each subsequent element is increased by 2 times its index, except for the element at index `i` which is now `e[0] + row[i] + 1`, `d` is a positive integer such that `d` is equal to `len(row) - 1`, `i` is greater than `d + 3`, `min_heap` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `row[:d]` and its index, and `min_heap` is a valid min heap with no elements having an index less than or equal to `i - (d + 3)`, except for the newly added tuple `(row[i], i)` and the tuple `e` where `e[1]` is between `i - (d + 3)` and `i - (d + 2)` (inclusive)**.
