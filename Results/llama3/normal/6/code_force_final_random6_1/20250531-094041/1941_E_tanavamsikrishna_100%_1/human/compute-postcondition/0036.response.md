Output State: **row is a list of non-negative integers where the first element is 1 and each subsequent element is increased by 2 times its index, except for the elements at indices d, d+1, ..., len(row)-1 which are now e[0] + row[i] + 1, d is a positive integer such that d is equal to len(row) - 1, i is equal to len(row) - 1, min_heap is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from row[:d] and its index, and min_heap is a valid min heap with no elements having an index less than or equal to len(row) - (d + 2), except for the newly added tuples (row[i], i) and the tuple e.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the row list has been modified such that the elements at indices d, d+1, ..., len(row)-1 have been updated to be e[0] + row[i] + 1, where e is the last tuple popped from the min heap. The value of d remains unchanged, and i has been incremented to be equal to len(row) - 1. The min heap contains the newly added tuples (row[i], i) and the tuple e, and has been updated to be a valid min heap with no elements having an index less than or equal to len(row) - (d + 2).
