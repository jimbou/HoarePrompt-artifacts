To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `(e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)`. This condition involves the variables `min_heap`, `i`, and `d`.

1. **min_heap**: The state mentions that the min heap contains tuples with indices greater than the new `i - (d + 2)`. For the loop to execute, we need at least one tuple in the heap with an index less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`. Therefore, the state of `min_heap` needs to be adjusted to include at least one tuple with an index less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.

2. **i**: The value of `i` is already incremented by 1, which is sufficient for the loop condition to be evaluated. No adjustment is needed for `i`.

3. **d**: The value of `d` remains unchanged, and its state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given these considerations, the adjusted state is:

State: **The min heap contains at least one tuple with an index less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`, the value of row[i] is to be determined in the next iteration, i is incremented by 1, d remains unchanged.**
