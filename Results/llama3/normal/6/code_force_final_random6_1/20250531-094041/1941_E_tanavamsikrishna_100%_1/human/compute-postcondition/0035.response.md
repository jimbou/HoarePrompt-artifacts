Output State: **The min heap contains two elements: e and a tuple (row[i] + e[0] + 1, i), the value of row[i] is e[0] + row[i] + 1, i is incremented by the number of iterations, d remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
The first line of the code updates the value of row[i] by adding e[0] and 1 to its previous value. The second line pushes the element e onto the min heap, and the third line pushes a tuple containing the updated value of row[i] and the current value of i onto the min heap. The value of i is incremented by the number of iterations, and the value of d remains unchanged.
