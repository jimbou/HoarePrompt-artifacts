Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `n` is an integer and `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer equal to the first element of `a`, `i` is equal to `n`, `cnt` is either 0 or the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` at the end of `a`, and `ans` is the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows:

* The value of `t` remains unchanged, within the range of 1 to 10^4 (inclusive).
* The value of `_` remains unchanged, equal to 1.
* The value of `n` remains unchanged, an integer greater than or equal to 0.
* The value of `a` remains unchanged, a list of integers.
* The value of `tmp` remains unchanged, equal to the first element of `a`.
* The value of `i` is now equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has iterated `n` times.
* The value of `cnt` is either 0 or the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` at the end of `a`. If `a` ends with a sequence of `tmp`, `cnt` will be the length of that sequence. Otherwise, `cnt` will be 0.
* The value of `ans` is the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a`. If `a` contains a sequence of `tmp` with a length less than `n`, `ans` will be that length. Otherwise, `ans` will be `n`.
