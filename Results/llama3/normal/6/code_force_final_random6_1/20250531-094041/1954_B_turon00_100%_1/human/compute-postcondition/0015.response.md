Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and t is greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer and n is greater than 2, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer equal to the first element of a, i is 2, cnt is 0, ans is either n or 0.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the minimum value between `ans` and `cnt` to `ans`. Since `cnt` is either 1 or 2, and `ans` is either `n` or 0, the minimum value will be either 0 or 1. The second line resets `cnt` to 0.

After executing the code, the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `cnt` is now 0, and the value of `ans` is either 0 or 1, depending on the previous values of `ans` and `cnt`.
