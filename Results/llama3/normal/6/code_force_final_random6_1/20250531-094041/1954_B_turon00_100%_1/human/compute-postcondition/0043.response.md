Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `n` is an integer and `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer equal to the first element of `a`, `i` is equal to `n`, `cnt` is either 0 or the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` at the end of `a`, and `ans` is the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` which is either the previous minimum number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` or the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` at the end of `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the minimum between its previous value and the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` at the end of `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
