The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. At the for the `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer and `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer equal to the first element of `a`, `i` is 2. If the current value of `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is either 1 or 2 and `ans` is either `n` or 0. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is 0.**
