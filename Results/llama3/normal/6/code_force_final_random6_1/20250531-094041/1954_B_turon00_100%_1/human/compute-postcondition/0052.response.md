Output State: **n is an integer, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer equal to the first element of a, cnt is 0, ans is n, t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 2, stdin is empty**

The code block executes as follows:

1. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `n` is an integer and `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` remains an integer and its value is updated.
2. The second line assigns a list of integers from the input to `a`. Since `a` is a list of integers, its value is updated to the new list.
3. The third line assigns the first element of `a` to `tmp`. Since `tmp` is an integer equal to the first element of `a`, its value is updated to the first element of the new list `a`.
4. The fourth line assigns 0 to `cnt`. Since `cnt` is either 0 or the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` at the end of `a`, its value is updated to 0.
5. The fifth line assigns `n` to `ans`. Since `ans` is the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` which is either the previous minimum number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` or the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` at the end of `a`, its value is updated to `n`.

The variables `t` and `_` are not affected by the code block, so their values remain the same. The variable `stdin` is empty after the code block executes, as all inputs have been consumed.

In summary, the code block updates the values of `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `cnt`, and `ans`, and leaves the values of `t` and `_` unchanged. The final state of the variables is as described above.
