Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer equal to the first element of a, t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 2, stdin is empty, i is at least 2, ans is the minimum of its original value and cnt, cnt is 0**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the minimum value between the original value of `ans` and `cnt` to `ans`. Since `cnt` is not defined in the initial state, we assume it has a value. The second line resets `cnt` to 0. The values of `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `t`, `_`, `stdin`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
