Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer and `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer equal to the first element of `a`, `i` is equal to `n`, `cnt` is either 0 or greater than 0, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`. The previous value of `ans` was either `n` or less than `n`, and `cnt` was either 0 or greater than 0. Therefore, the new value of `ans` is either the minimum of `n` and `cnt` or the minimum of a value less than `n` and `cnt`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
