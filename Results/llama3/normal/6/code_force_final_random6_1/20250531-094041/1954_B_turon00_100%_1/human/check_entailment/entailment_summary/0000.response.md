Reasoning: 
The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful. It iterates through the array, keeping track of the count of consecutive elements that are the same as the first element. It updates the minimum count whenever it encounters a different element. If the array contains only one element or the minimum count is equal to the length of the array, it prints -1, indicating that it is impossible to make the array stop being beautiful. Otherwise, it prints the minimum count.

Correctness: **True**
