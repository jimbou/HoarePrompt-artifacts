Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is equal to `t`, `n` is an integer and `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer equal to the first element of `a`, `i` is equal to `n`, `cnt` is either 0 or greater than 0, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`. If `n` is 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, `ans` is printed.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the output state after the loop executes 3 times, with the only difference being that the variable `_` is now equal to `t`, indicating that the loop has executed `t` times. The other variables remain unchanged, with `n` being an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` being a list of integers, `tmp` being an integer equal to the first element of `a`, `i` being equal to `n`, `cnt` being either 0 or greater than 0, and `ans` being the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`. If `n` is 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, `ans` is printed.
