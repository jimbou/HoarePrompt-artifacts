Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive) and t is greater than 0, _ is 1, n is an integer and n is greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer equal to the first element of a, i is equal to n, cnt is 0, ans is n.**

The code snippet reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`, replacing its previous value. Then, it reads a list of integers from stdin, splits them into individual integers, and assigns the result to `a`, replacing its previous value. The first element of `a` is assigned to `tmp`, replacing its previous value. The value of `cnt` is reset to 0, and the value of `ans` is set to the new value of `n`. The value of `i` is not modified, so it remains equal to the new value of `n`. The value of `t` and `_` are not affected by the code snippet, so they retain their previous values.
