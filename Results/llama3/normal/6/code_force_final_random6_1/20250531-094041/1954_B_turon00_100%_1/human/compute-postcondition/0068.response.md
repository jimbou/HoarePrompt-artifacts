Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer equal to the first element of `a`, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is the minimum of the current minimum number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` and 0, `t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 2, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the minimum of its current value and `cnt`, which is 0. This means that `ans` will be 0 if it was previously greater than 0, or it will remain the same if it was already 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
