Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer equal to the first element of a, t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 2, stdin is empty, i is at least 2. If a[i] is equal to tmp, cnt is increased by 1. Otherwise, ans is updated to be the minimum of its original value and cnt, and cnt is reset to 0.***
