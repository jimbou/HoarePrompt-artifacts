The code prints the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a`. Since `tmp` is the first element of `a` and `ans` is the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a`, the print statement will output the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of the first element of `a` in `a`.

Output: **the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of the first element of `a` in `a`**
