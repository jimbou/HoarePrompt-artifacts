Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 1, n is an integer and n is greater than 1, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer equal to the first element of a, i is 1, cnt is 0, and ans is either 0 or the minimum of n and 0, depending on whether the current value of a[i] is equal to tmp or not.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `ans` and `cnt`. The first line assigns the minimum value between `ans` and `cnt` to `ans`. Since `cnt` is either 0 or 1, and `ans` is either `n` or the minimum of `n` and 0, the new value of `ans` will be either 0 or the minimum of `n` and 0, depending on whether the current value of `a[i]` is equal to `tmp` or not. The second line resets `cnt` to 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
