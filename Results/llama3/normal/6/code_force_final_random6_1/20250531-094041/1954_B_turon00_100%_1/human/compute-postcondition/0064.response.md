The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `cnt` is unknown, so the output state is: variable `cnt` is increased by 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer equal to the first element of a, t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 2, stdin is empty, i is at least 2, cnt is increased by 1.
