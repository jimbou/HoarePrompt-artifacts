The code increments the value of `cnt` by 1. The previous value of `cnt` was 0. Therefore, the new value of `cnt` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer equal to the first element of `a`, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is `n`, `t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 2, stdin is empty, `i` is 0, and the current value of `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`.**
