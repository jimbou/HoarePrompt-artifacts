Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it not beautiful.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It first reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.
3. It initializes a variable `tmp` to the first element of the array, and a counter `cnt` to 0.
4. It then iterates over the array, incrementing `cnt` whenever it encounters an element equal to `tmp`. Whenever it encounters an element not equal to `tmp`, it updates the answer `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and `cnt`, and resets `cnt` to 0.
5. After the loop, it updates `ans` one more time to be the minimum of its current value and `cnt`.
6. Finally, it checks if `n` is 1 or if `ans` is equal to `n`. If either condition is true, it prints -1, indicating that it's impossible to make the array not beautiful. Otherwise, it prints `ans`, which is the minimum number of elements that need to be removed.

The program's logic is correct because it correctly identifies the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array not beautiful. The key insight is that the array can be made not beautiful by removing a contiguous block of elements that are equal to the first element of the array. The program's loop iterates over the array, keeping track of the length of the current contiguous block of elements equal to the first element, and updates the answer whenever it finds a shorter block.

Therefore, the program is correct, and the answer is:

Correctness: **True**
