To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `_` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), which does not guarantee that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and `_` is now 0.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
