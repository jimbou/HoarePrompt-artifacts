Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it not beautiful.

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.
3. It initializes a temporary variable `tmp` to the first element of the array `a`.
4. It initializes a counter `cnt` to 0 and a variable `ans` to the length of the array `n`.
5. It then iterates over the array `a`. If the current element is equal to `tmp`, it increments the counter `cnt`. If the current element is not equal to `tmp`, it updates `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and `cnt`, and resets `cnt` to 0.
6. After the loop, it updates `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and `cnt`.
7. If the length of the array `n` is 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints `ans`.

The logic is correct because:

* If the array contains only one element, it is impossible to make it not beautiful by removing elements, so the program correctly prints -1.
* If the array contains only one type of element, it is impossible to make it not beautiful by removing elements, so the program correctly prints -1.
* If the array contains multiple types of elements, the program correctly finds the minimum length of a subsequence that contains all elements of the array, which is the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array not beautiful.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
