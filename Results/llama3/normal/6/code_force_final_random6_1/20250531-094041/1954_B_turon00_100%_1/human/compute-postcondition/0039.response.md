Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `n` is an integer and `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer equal to the first element of `a`, `i` is 2, `cnt` is either 1, 2 or 3, and `ans` is either `n` or the minimum of `n` and 0, depending on whether the current value of `a[i]` is equal to `tmp` or not. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is either 1 or 2. Otherwise, `cnt` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `cnt` is now either 1, 2, or 3, depending on its previous value. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is now either 1 or 2. Otherwise, `cnt` is now 1. The other conditions and values of the variables remain the same as in the initial state.
