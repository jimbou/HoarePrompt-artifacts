Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer and `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer equal to the first element of `a`, `i` is 2. If the current value of `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is either 2 or 3 and `ans` is either `n` or 0. Otherwise, `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1. If the current value of `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is either 2 or 3, otherwise, it is 1. The values of the other variables remain the same.
