Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `n` is an integer and `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer equal to the first element of `a`, `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is either 1, 2 or 3 and `ans` is either `n` or the minimum of `n` and 0. If `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is either `n` or the minimum of `n` and 0.***
