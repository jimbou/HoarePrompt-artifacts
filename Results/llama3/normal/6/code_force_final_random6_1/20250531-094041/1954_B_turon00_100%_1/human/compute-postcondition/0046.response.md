Output: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `n` is an integer and `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer equal to the first element of `a`, `i` is equal to `n`, `cnt` is either 0 or the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` at the end of `a`, and `ans` is the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` which is either the previous minimum number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` or the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` at the end of `a`. The current value of `n` is either 1 or equal to the current value of `ans`, and -1 is being printed**
