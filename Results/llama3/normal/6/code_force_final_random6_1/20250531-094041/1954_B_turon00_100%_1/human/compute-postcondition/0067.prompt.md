Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer equal to the first element of a, cnt is 0, ans is n, t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 2, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == tmp:
        cnt += 1
    else:
        ans = min(ans, cnt)
        cnt = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer equal to the first element of a, t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 2, stdin is empty. If the current element of a at index i is equal to tmp, then cnt is 1 and ans is n. Otherwise, cnt is 0 and ans is the minimum of the original value of ans and the original value of cnt.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer equal to the first element of a, t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 2, stdin is empty, i is at least 1. If the current element of a at index i is equal to tmp, then cnt is either 2 or 1 and ans is either n or the minimum of the original value of ans and the original value of cnt. Otherwise, cnt is 0 and ans is the minimum of the original value of ans and the original value of cnt.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer equal to the first element of a, t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 2, stdin is empty, i is at least 2. If a[i] is equal to tmp, cnt is increased by 1. Otherwise, ans is updated to be the minimum of its original value and cnt, and cnt is reset to 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
