Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer equal to the first element of a, cnt is 0, ans is the minimum of the original value of ans and the original value of cnt, t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 2, stdin is empty, i is 0, and the current element of a at index i is not equal to tmp**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the minimum of its original value (`n`) and the original value of `cnt` (which was 0). Since `n` is greater than 0, `ans` will be 0. The value of `cnt` has been reset to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
