The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is not specified, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`. Since `n` is greater than 0, we can assume that `i` is at least 0, so the new value of `i` is at least 1. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer equal to the first element of a, t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 2, stdin is empty. If the current element of a at index i is equal to tmp, then cnt is 1 and ans is n. Otherwise, cnt is 0 and ans is the minimum of the original value of ans and the original value of cnt, i is at least 1**
