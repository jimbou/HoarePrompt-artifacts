Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer and `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer equal to the first element of `a`, `i` is 0. If the current value of `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is equal to `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is 0.***
