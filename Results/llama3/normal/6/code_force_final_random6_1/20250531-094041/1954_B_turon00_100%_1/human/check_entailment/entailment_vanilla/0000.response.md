Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array elements `a`.
3. It initializes a variable `tmp` to the first element of the array and a counter `cnt` to 0.
4. It then iterates through the array, incrementing the counter `cnt` whenever it encounters an element equal to `tmp`.
5. Whenever it encounters an element not equal to `tmp`, it updates the answer `ans` to be the minimum of the current answer and the counter `cnt`, and resets the counter `cnt` to 0.
6. After iterating through the entire array, it updates the answer `ans` one last time to be the minimum of the current answer and the final value of the counter `cnt`.
7. If the array has only one element or if the answer `ans` is equal to the size of the array `n`, it prints -1, indicating that it's impossible to make the array stop being beautiful.
8. Otherwise, it prints the answer `ans`, which represents the minimum number of elements that need to be removed.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
