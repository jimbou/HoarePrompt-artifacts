Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and t must be greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer equal to the first element of a, cnt is 0, ans is equal to n.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `_` also remains 0 as it is not modified. The code reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`, so `n` becomes an integer. The next line reads a list of integers from stdin, splits them into individual integers, and assigns them to `a`. The third line assigns the first element of `a` to `tmp`, making `tmp` an integer equal to the first element of `a`. The fourth line initializes `cnt` to 0. The fifth line assigns the value of `n` to `ans`, making `ans` equal to `n`.
