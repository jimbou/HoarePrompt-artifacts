The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the minimum value between `ans` and `cnt` to `ans`. Since `ans` is initially equal to `n` and `cnt` is 0, `ans` becomes 0. The second line assigns 0 to `cnt`, which does not change its value since it was already 0.

Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and t is greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer and n is greater than 0, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer equal to the first element of a, cnt is 0, ans is 0, i is 0, and the element of a at index i is not equal to tmp**
