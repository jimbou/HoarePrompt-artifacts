Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer equal to the first element of `a`, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is the minimum of the current minimum number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` and 0, `t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 2, stdin is empty. If `n` is 1 or equal to `ans`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the minimum of the current minimum number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` and 0 is printed.***
