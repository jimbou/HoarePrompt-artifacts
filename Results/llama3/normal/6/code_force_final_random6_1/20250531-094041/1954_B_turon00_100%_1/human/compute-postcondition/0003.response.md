The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and t must be greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer equal to the first element of a, cnt is 0, ans is equal to n does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and t must be greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer and n is greater than 0, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer equal to the first element of a, cnt is 0, ans is equal to n, i is 0**
