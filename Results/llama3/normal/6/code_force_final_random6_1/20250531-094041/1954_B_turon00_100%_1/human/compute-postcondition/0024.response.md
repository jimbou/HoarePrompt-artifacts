The code prints the value of `ans` which is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`. Where `ans` is not equal to `n` and `n` is not equal to 1.
Output: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer and `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer equal to the first element of `a`, `i` is equal to `n`, `cnt` is either 0 or greater than 0, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`. Additionally, `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`, and ans is printed**
