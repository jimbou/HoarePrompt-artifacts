Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input array contains only one distinct element, but the length of the array is greater than 1. In this case, the program will output the length of the array, which is incorrect. The correct output should be -1, because it is impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements.

For example, if the input is:

3
2 2 2

The program will output 2, but the correct output should be -1.

The issue is that the program only checks if the length of the array is 1 or if the minimum count of consecutive elements is equal to the length of the array. However, it does not consider the case where the array contains only one distinct element, but the length is greater than 1.
