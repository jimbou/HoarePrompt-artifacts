Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer equal to the first element of a, t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 2, stdin is empty, i is at least 1. If the current element of a at index i is equal to tmp, then cnt is either 2 or 1 and ans is either n or the minimum of the original value of ans and the original value of cnt. Otherwise, cnt is 0 and ans is the minimum of the original value of ans and the original value of cnt.***
