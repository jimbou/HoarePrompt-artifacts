Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 1, n is an integer and n is greater than 0, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer equal to the first element of a, i is 0, cnt is 0, ans is the minimum of the original value of ans (which is n) and the original value of cnt (which is 0), and the current element of a at index i is not equal to tmp**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the minimum of its original value (`n`) and the original value of `cnt` (which is 0). Since `cnt` was 0, `ans` will be 0 if `n` was greater than 0, otherwise it will remain `n`. The value of `cnt` has been reset to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
