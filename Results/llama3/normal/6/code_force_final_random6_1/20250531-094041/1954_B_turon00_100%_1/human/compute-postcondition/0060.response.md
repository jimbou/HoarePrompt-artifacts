Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer equal to the first element of `a`, `t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `cnt` is either 2 or 1, `ans` is either `n` or the minimum of the original value of `ans` and the original value of `cnt`, `i` is at least 1, stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1. If the current element of `a` at index `i` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 2 and `ans` is still `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is the minimum of its original value and the original value of `cnt`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
