Output State: **n is an integer, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer equal to the first element of a, cnt is 0, ans is the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of tmp in a, t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 2, stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable 'ans' will hold the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of the value 'tmp' in the list 'a'. The variable 'cnt' will be reset to 0, and the other variables will remain unchanged.
