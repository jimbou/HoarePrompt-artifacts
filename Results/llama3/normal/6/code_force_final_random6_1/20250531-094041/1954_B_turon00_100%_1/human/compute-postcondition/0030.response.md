The code increments the value of `cnt` by 1. The previous value of `cnt` was 0, so the new value of `cnt` is 1. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `n` is an integer and `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer equal to the first element of `a`, `i` is 0, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is `n`, and the current value of `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`.**
