Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and t is greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer and n is greater than 1, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer equal to the first element of a, i is 1, ans is 0, cnt is 0**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the minimum value between `ans` and `cnt` to `ans`. Since `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is either 0 or `n`, `ans` becomes 0. The second line assigns 0 to `cnt`. No other variables are affected by the code. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, and `i` remain unchanged.
