This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints output. It accepts an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5) followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n) such that the list is beautiful. The function then finds the minimum length of a subsequence that contains all elements of the list and prints it. If the list contains only one element or the minimum length is equal to the length of the list, it prints -1.
