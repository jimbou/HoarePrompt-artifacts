Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` test cases, where each test case contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5) followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= n) such that the list is beautiful.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    tmp = a[0]
    cnt = 0
    ans = n
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] == tmp:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
            cnt = 0
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if n == 1 or ans == n:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer and `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer equal to the first element of `a`, `i` is equal to `n`, `cnt` is either 0 or greater than 0, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`. If `n` is 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, `ans` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `n` is an integer and `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer equal to the first element of `a`, `i` is equal to `n`, `cnt` is either 0 or the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` at the end of `a`, and `ans` is the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` which is either the previous minimum number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` or the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` at the end of `a`. If `n` is 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer equal to the first element of `a`, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is the minimum of the current minimum number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` and 0, `t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 2, stdin is empty. If `n` is 1 or equal to `ans`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the minimum of the current minimum number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` and 0 is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
