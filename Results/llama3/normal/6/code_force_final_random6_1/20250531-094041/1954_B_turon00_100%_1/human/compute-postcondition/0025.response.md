Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer and `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer equal to the first element of `a`, `i` is equal to `n`, `cnt` is either 0 or greater than 0, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`. If `n` is 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, `ans` is printed.***
