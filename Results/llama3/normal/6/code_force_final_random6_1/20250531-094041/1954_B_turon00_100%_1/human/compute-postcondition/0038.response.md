To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`, which is 2.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `n` is an integer and `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer equal to the first element of `a`, `i` is 2, `cnt` is either 0, 1 or 2, and `ans` is either `n` or the minimum of `n` and 0, depending on whether the current value of `a[i]` is equal to `tmp` or not. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is either 1 or 2. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0.**
