Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 1, n is an integer and n is greater than 2, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer equal to the first element of a, i is 2, cnt is 0, and ans is either n or the minimum of n and 0, depending on whether the current value of a[i] is equal to tmp or not.**

The first line of code assigns the minimum value between `ans` and `cnt` to `ans`. Since `cnt` is either 0, 1, or 2, and `ans` is either `n` or the minimum of `n` and 0, the value of `ans` will be either `n` or the minimum of `n` and `cnt`. The second line of code assigns 0 to `cnt`, so `cnt` becomes 0. No other variables are affected by the code.
