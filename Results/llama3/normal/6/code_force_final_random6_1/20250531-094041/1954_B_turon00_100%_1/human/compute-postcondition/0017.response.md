Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer and `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer equal to the first element of `a`, `i` is equal to `n`, `cnt` is either 0 or greater than 0, `ans` is either `n` or less than `n`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations means that the loop has finished executing and the variables have reached their final values. The value of `t` remains unchanged, `_` is still 0, `n` is still an integer but its value is now greater than or equal to 0 (since the loop may have executed 0 times), `a` is still a list of integers, `tmp` is still equal to the first element of `a`, `i` is now equal to `n` (since the loop has finished executing), `cnt` is either 0 (if the last iteration did not match `tmp`) or greater than 0 (if the last iteration matched `tmp`), and `ans` is either `n` (if no iterations matched `tmp`) or less than `n` (if at least one iteration matched `tmp`).
