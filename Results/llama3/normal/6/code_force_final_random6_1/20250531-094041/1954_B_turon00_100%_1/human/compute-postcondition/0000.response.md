The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by `t` test cases. Since `t` is assigned the first integer from the input, the remaining input in stdin is `t` test cases. Each test case contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5) followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= n) such that the list is beautiful. The value of `t` is now an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` test cases, where each test case contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5) followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= n) such that the list is beautiful.**
