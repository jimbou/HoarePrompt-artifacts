Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer equal to the first element of a, t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 2, ans is the minimum of the original value of ans and the original value of cnt, cnt is 0, stdin is empty, i is at least 1**

The code block modifies the values of `ans` and `cnt`. The first line assigns the minimum value between the original value of `ans` and the original value of `cnt` to `ans`. Since `cnt` is 0 or 1 depending on whether the current element of `a` at index `i` is equal to `tmp`, and `ans` is `n` if `cnt` is 1, `ans` becomes the minimum of `n` and `cnt`. The second line resets `cnt` to 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
