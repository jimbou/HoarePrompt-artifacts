Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `n` is an integer and `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer equal to the first element of `a`, `i` is 1, `cnt` is either 0, 1 or 2, and `ans` is either `n` or the minimum of `n` and 0, depending on whether the current value of `a[i]` is equal to `tmp` or not. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is either 1 or 2. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0.***
