To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects in it.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only object in the loop head is `_`, which is the loop variable, and `t`, which is the range.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be decreased by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive) and `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer and `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer equal to the first element of `a`, `i` is equal to `n`, `cnt` is either 0 or greater than 0, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`. If `n` is 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, `ans` is printed.**
