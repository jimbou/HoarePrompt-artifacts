Output State: **t is 0, numbers is a list containing 0 integers, _ is -1, values is a list of 2 integers where the first integer is 0 and the second integer is 1, sum_values is a list of 2 integers where the first integer is 0 and the second integer is 1, total is 1, stdin is empty, i is 1**

The code modifies the values of `values`, `sum_values`, and `total`. The first line assigns the value of `i` to the second element of `values`, making it 1. The second line increments `total` by the value of `i`, making it 1. The third line assigns the value of `total` to the second element of `sum_values`, making it 1. No other variables are affected.
