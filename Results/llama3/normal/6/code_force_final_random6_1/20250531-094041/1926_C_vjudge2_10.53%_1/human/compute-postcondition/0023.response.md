The only variable in the loop head is variable  n and list numbers, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list numbers. If the list has at least 1 integer the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, t is 0, numbers is a list containing 0 integers, _ is -1, values is a list of 11 integers where the first integer is 0, the second integer is 1, the third integer is 2, the fourth integer is 3, the fifth integer is 4, the sixth integer is 5, the seventh integer is 6, the eighth integer is 7, the ninth integer is 8, the tenth integer is 9, and the eleventh integer is 285, sum_values is a list of 11 integers where the first integer is 0, the second integer is 1, the third integer is 3, the fourth integer is 6, the fifth integer is 10, the sixth integer is 15, the seventh integer is 21, the eighth integer is 28, the ninth integer is 36, the tenth integer is 45, and the eleventh integer is 330, total is 45, stdin is empty, i is 13, n is greater than or equal to 12. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 integer and the n is the first integer in the list.
State: **t is 0, numbers is a list containing at least 1 integer, _ is -1, values is a list of 11 integers where the first integer is 0, the second integer is 1, the third integer is 2, the fourth integer is 3, the fifth integer is 4, the sixth integer is 5, the seventh integer is 6, the eighth integer is 7, the ninth integer is 8, the tenth integer is 9, and the eleventh integer is 285, sum_values is a list of 11 integers where the first integer is 0, the second integer is 1, the third integer is 3, the fourth integer is 6, the fifth integer is 10, the sixth integer is 15, the seventh integer is 21, the eighth integer is 28, the ninth integer is 36, the tenth integer is 45, and the eleventh integer is 330, total is 45, stdin is empty, i is 13, n is the first integer in the list, n is greater than or equal to 12**
