Output State: **t is 0, numbers is a list containing 0 integers, _ is -1, values is a list of 10 integers where the first integer is 0, the second integer is 1, the third integer is 2, the fourth integer is 3, the fifth integer is 4, the sixth integer is 5, the seventh integer is 6, the eighth integer is 7, the ninth integer is 8, and the tenth integer is 9, sum_values is a list of 10 integers where the first integer is 0, the second integer is 1, the third integer is 3, the fourth integer is 6, the fifth integer is 10, the sixth integer is 15, the seventh integer is 21, the eighth integer is 28, the ninth integer is 36, and the tenth integer is 45, total is 45, stdin is empty, i is 9**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a state where the list "values" contains the integers from 0 to 9, the list "sum_values" contains the cumulative sum of the integers from 0 to 9, and the variable "total" contains the sum of the integers from 0 to 9. The other variables remain unchanged.
