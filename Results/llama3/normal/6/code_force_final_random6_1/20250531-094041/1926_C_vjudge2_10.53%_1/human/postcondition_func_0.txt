This function reads a series of integers from standard input, calculates the sum of the values of the digits of each integer, and prints the sum of these sums for each integer. The function first initializes two lists, `values` and `sum_values`, to store the values of the digits and the cumulative sum of these values, respectively. It then calculates the values of the digits for integers from 1 to the maximum input integer and stores them in `values`. The function then calculates the cumulative sum of these values and stores them in `sum_values`. Finally, it reads a series of integers from standard input, looks up the corresponding sum of digit values in `sum_values`, and prints the result.
