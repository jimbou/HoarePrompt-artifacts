Output State: **t is 0, numbers is a list containing 0 integers, _ is -1, values is a list of 11 integers where the first integer is 0, the second integer is 1, the third integer is 2, the fourth integer is 3, the fifth integer is 4, the sixth integer is 5, the seventh integer is 6, the eighth integer is 7, the ninth integer is 8, the tenth integer is 9, and the eleventh integer is 285, sum_values is a list of 11 integers where the first integer is 0, the second integer is 1, the third integer is 3, the fourth integer is 6, the fifth integer is 10, the sixth integer is 15, the seventh integer is 21, the eighth integer is 28, the ninth integer is 36, the tenth integer is 45, and the eleventh integer is 330, total is 45, stdin is empty, i is 13, n is greater than or equal to 12**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the values of the variables in the loop head and body. The values of the variables in the loop head and body have been updated according to the loop's logic. The value of `i` has been incremented to 13, and the value of `n` has been updated to be greater than or equal to 12. The values of `values` and `sum_values` have been updated according to the loop's logic, with the eleventh integer in `values` being 285 and the eleventh integer in `sum_values` being 330.
