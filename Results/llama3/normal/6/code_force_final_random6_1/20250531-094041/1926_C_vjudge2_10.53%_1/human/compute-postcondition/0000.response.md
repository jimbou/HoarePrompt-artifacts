Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, numbers is an empty list, stdin contains t lines each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5)**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `t`, which is between 1 and 10^4. The second line initializes an empty list called `numbers`. No other variables are affected. The state of `stdin` is updated to contain `t` lines each containing an integer `n` between 1 and 2 * 10^5.
