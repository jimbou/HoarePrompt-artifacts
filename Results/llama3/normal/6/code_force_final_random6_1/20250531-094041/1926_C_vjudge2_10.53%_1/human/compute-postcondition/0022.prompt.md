Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is 0, numbers is a list containing 0 integers, _ is -1, values is a list of 10 integers where the first integer is 0, the second integer is 1, the third integer is 2, the fourth integer is 3, the fifth integer is 4, the sixth integer is 5, the seventh integer is 6, the eighth integer is 7, the ninth integer is 8, and the tenth integer is 9, sum_values is a list of 10 integers where the first integer is 0, the second integer is 1, the third integer is 3, the fourth integer is 6, the fifth integer is 10, the sixth integer is 15, the seventh integer is 21, the eighth integer is 28, the ninth integer is 36, and the tenth integer is 45, total is 45, stdin is empty, i is 9
Code of the loop:
for i in range(10, n + 1):
    word = str(i)
    last = int(word[len(word) - 1])
    remainder = int(word[:-1])
    values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]
    sum_total = values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]
    sum_values[i] = sum_total


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is 0, numbers is a list containing 0 integers, _ is -1, values is a list of 11 integers where the first integer is 0, the second integer is 1, the third integer is 2, the fourth integer is 3, the fifth integer is 4, the sixth integer is 5, the seventh integer is 6, the eighth integer is 7, the ninth integer is 8, the tenth integer is 9, and the eleventh integer is 45, sum_values is a list of 11 integers where the first integer is 0, the second integer is 1, the third integer is 3, the fourth integer is 6, the fifth integer is 10, the sixth integer is 15, the seventh integer is 21, the eighth integer is 28, the ninth integer is 36, the tenth integer is 45, and the eleventh integer is 90, total is 45, stdin is empty, i is 10, n is greater than or equal to 10

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is 0, numbers is a list containing 0 integers, _ is -1, values is a list of 11 integers where the first integer is 0, the second integer is 1, the third integer is 2, the fourth integer is 3, the fifth integer is 4, the sixth integer is 5, the seventh integer is 6, the eighth integer is 7, the ninth integer is 8, the tenth integer is 9, and the eleventh integer is 90 + 45, sum_values is a list of 11 integers where the first integer is 0, the second integer is 1, the third integer is 3, the fourth integer is 6, the fifth integer is 10, the sixth integer is 15, the seventh integer is 21, the eighth integer is 28, the ninth integer is 36, the tenth integer is 45, and the eleventh integer is 90 + 45 + 90, total is 45, stdin is empty, i is 11, n is greater than or equal to 11

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is 0, numbers is a list containing 0 integers, _ is -1, values is a list of 11 integers where the first integer is 0, the second integer is 1, the third integer is 2, the fourth integer is 3, the fifth integer is 4, the sixth integer is 5, the seventh integer is 6, the eighth integer is 7, the ninth integer is 8, the tenth integer is 9, and the eleventh integer is 135, sum_values is a list of 11 integers where the first integer is 0, the second integer is 1, the third integer is 3, the fourth integer is 6, the fifth integer is 10, the sixth integer is 15, the seventh integer is 21, the eighth integer is 28, the ninth integer is 36, the tenth integer is 45, and the eleventh integer is 180, total is 45, stdin is empty, i is 12, n is greater than 11




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
