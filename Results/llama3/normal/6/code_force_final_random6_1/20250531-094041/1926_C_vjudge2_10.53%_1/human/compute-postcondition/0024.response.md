The code prints the nth element of the list `sum_values`, where n is the first integer in the list `numbers`. Since n is greater than or equal to 12, but the list `sum_values` only has 11 elements (with indices 0 through 10), this will result in an "IndexError: list index out of range" exception, because there is no element at index 12 or greater in the list `sum_values`.

However, based on the structure of the problem, if we were to assume that the list `sum_values` had at least n+1 elements, the print statement would output the nth element of the list `sum_values`.

Output: **IndexError: list index out of range**
