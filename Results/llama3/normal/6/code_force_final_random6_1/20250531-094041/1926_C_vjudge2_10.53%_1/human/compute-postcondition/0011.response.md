The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 10, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1.
State: **`t` is 0, `numbers` is a list containing 0 integers, `_` is -1, `values` is a list of 1 integer where the first integer is 0, `sum_values` is a list of 1 integer where the first integer is 0, `total` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1**
