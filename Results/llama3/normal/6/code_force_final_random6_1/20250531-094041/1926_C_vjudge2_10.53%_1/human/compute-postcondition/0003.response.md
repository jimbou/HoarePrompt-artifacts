The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 that must be greater than 1, numbers is a list containing one integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), _ is 1, stdin contains t - 1 lines each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5)**
