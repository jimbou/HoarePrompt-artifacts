Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 that must be equal to 0, numbers is a list containing t integers (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), _ is t-1, values is a list of max(numbers) + 1 zeros, sum_values is a list of max(numbers) + 1 zeros, total is 0, stdin is empty**

The code initializes two lists, `values` and `sum_values`, each containing `max(numbers) + 1` zeros. It also sets `total` to 0. The initial state of `t`, `numbers`, and `_` remains unchanged, as the code does not modify these variables. The stdin remains empty as it was initially.
