Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 that must be equal to 0, numbers is a list containing t integers (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), _ is t-1, stdin is empty**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable t will be equal to 0, the list numbers will contain t integers (which are the inputs read from stdin), the loop counter _ will be equal to t-1, and stdin will be empty because all input lines have been read.
