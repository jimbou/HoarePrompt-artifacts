Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the line where the program calculates the sum of the digits for numbers greater than 10. The program assumes that the sum of the digits of a number is equal to the sum of the digits of its last digit and the sum of the digits of the remaining part of the number. However, this assumption is incorrect.

For example, consider the number 123. The program calculates the sum of its digits as follows:

values[123] = values[3] + values[12]
= 3 + (1 + 2)
= 6

However, the correct sum of the digits of 123 is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

A correct approach would be to calculate the sum of the digits of each number from 1 to n, and then sum up these values. Here is a corrected version of the program:

def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    numbers = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        numbers.append(n)
    sum_values = [0 for _ in range(max(numbers) + 1)]
    for i in range(1, max(numbers) + 1):
        sum_values[i] = sum_values[i - 1] + sum(int(digit) for digit in str(i))
    for n in numbers:
        print(sum_values[n])

This program correctly calculates the sum of the numbers on the board after Vladislav replaces each integer with the sum of its digits.
