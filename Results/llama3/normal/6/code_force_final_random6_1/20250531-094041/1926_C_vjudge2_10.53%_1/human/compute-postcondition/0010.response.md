Output State: **t is 0, numbers is a list containing 0 integers, _ is -1, values is a list of 1 integer where the first integer is 0, sum_values is a list of 1 integer where the first integer is 0, total is 0, stdin is empty, i is 0**

In this output state, the initial values of `t`, `numbers`, `_`, `values`, `sum_values`, `total`, `stdin`, and `i` are maintained because the code snippet does not modify them. The value of `t` is still 0, and `numbers` is an empty list. The value of `_` is -1, and `values` and `sum_values` are lists of 1 integer each, where the first integer is 0. The value of `total` is still 0, and `stdin` is empty. The value of `i` is still 0.
