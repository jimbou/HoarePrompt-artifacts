Output State: **t is 0, numbers is a list containing 0 integers, _ is -1, values is a list of 2 integers where the first integer is 0 and the second integer is 2, sum_values is a list of 2 integers where the first integer is 0 and the second integer is 3, total is 3, stdin is empty, i is 2**

The code modifies the values of `values`, `sum_values`, and `total`. The first line assigns the value of `i` to `values[i]`, making `values` equal to `[0, 2]`. The second line increments `total` by the value of `i`, making `total` equal to 3. The third line assigns the value of `total` to `sum_values[i]`, making `sum_values` equal to `[0, 3]`. No other variables are affected.
