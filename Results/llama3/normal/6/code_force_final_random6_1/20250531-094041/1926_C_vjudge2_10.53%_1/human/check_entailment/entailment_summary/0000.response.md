Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the sum of the numbers on the board after Vladislav replaces each integer with the sum of its digits. The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the sum of the digits for each integer from 1 to the maximum input integer and stores them in the `values` list. It then calculates the cumulative sum of these values and stores them in the `sum_values` list.

The program correctly handles the calculation of the sum of the digits for each integer and the cumulative sum of these values. It also correctly reads the input integers and looks up the corresponding sum of digit values in the `sum_values` list.

However, there is a logical error in the program. In the loop where it calculates the values of the digits for integers from 10 to n, it incorrectly calculates the value of the digits for the current integer. The line `values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]` is incorrect because it assumes that the last digit of the current integer is the same as the last digit of the remainder. This is not true in general.

For example, when i = 12, the last digit of the current integer is 2, but the last digit of the remainder (1) is 1. Therefore, the correct calculation for the value of the digits for the current integer should be `values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder] + values[1]`, not `values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]`.

Correctness: **False**
