According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If the loop can execute, `i` must be 0. 
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 that must be equal to 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `_` is `t-1`, `values` is a list of max(`numbers`) + 1 zeros, `sum_values` is a list of max(`numbers`) + 1 zeros, `total` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 0**
