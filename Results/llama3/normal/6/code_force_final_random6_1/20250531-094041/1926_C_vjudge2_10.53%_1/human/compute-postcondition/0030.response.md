The code prints the value of `sum_values[n]`, where `n` is the third integer in the list `numbers`. Since the exact list `numbers` is not provided, we can't determine the exact value of `n`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the value of `sum_values[n]`, which is the sum of the first `n` integers in the list `values`.

Output: **45 (which is the sum of the first n integers in the list values)**
