To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than or equal to 10, because the range starts from 10 and goes up to `n + 1`. Since `i` is already 9, it needs to be adjusted to 10 for the loop to start executing.

State: **`t` is 0, `numbers` is a list containing 0 integers, `_` is -1, `values` is a list of 10 integers where the first integer is 0, the second integer is 1, the third integer is 2, the fourth integer is 3, the fifth integer is 4, the sixth integer is 5, the seventh integer is 6, the eighth integer is 7, the ninth integer is 8, and the tenth integer is 9, `sum_values` is a list of 10 integers where the first integer is 0, the second integer is 1, the third integer is 3, the fourth integer is 6, the fifth integer is 10, the sixth integer is 15, the seventh integer is 21, the eighth integer is 28, the ninth integer is 36, and the tenth integer is 45, `total` is 45, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 10, `n` must be greater than or equal to 10**
