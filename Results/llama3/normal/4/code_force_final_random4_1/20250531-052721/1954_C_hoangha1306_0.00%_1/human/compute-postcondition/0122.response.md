Output State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000), stdin contains 2t - 6 strings, each representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, with the first t - 1 strings having the same length as the next t - 1 strings, q is 2, a is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9 and has at least 1 character, b is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, i is less than the length of a, x is the minimum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string a and the integer represented by the character at index i of string b, y is the maximum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string a and the integer represented by the character at index i of string b, kq1 is a string representing the minimum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string a and the integer represented by the character at index i of string b, followed by the maximum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string a and the integer represented by the character at index i of string b, kq2 is a string representing the maximum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string a and the integer represented by the character at index i of string b, followed by the minimum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string a and the integer represented by the character at index i of string b, and vt is 1 if the character at index i of string a is not equal to the character at index i of string b, otherwise vt is 0.**

In this output state, the code has appended the maximum value `y` to the string `kq1` and the minimum value `x` to the string `kq2`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
