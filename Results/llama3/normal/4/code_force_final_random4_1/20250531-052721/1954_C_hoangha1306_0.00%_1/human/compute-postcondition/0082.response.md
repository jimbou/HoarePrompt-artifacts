Output State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000), stdin contains 2t - 4 strings, each representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, with the first t - 1 strings having the same length as the next t - 1 strings, q is 1, a is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, b is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, kq1 is a string consisting of the minimum and maximum of the integer represented by the characters at each index of string a and the integer represented by the characters at each index of string b, kq2 is a string consisting of the maximum and minimum of the integer represented by the characters at each index of string a and the integer represented by the characters at each index of string b, vt is either 0 or 1, i is equal to the length of a, x is the minimum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string a and the integer represented by the character at index i of string b, y is the maximum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string a and the integer represented by the character at index i of string b, and kq2 (containing the maximum and minimum of the integer represented by the characters at each index of string a and the integer represented by the characters at each index of string b) is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that kq1 and kq2 are strings consisting of the minimum and maximum of the integer represented by the characters at each index of string a and the integer represented by the characters at each index of string b. The value of vt is either 0 or 1, and i is equal to the length of a. The values of x and y are the minimum and maximum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string a and the integer represented by the character at index i of string b. The value of kq2 is printed.
