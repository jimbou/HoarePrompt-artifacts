Output State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000), q is 1, a is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 2 characters, b is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9. If a[i] is equal to b[i], then kq1 and kq2 are strings consisting of the first character of a. Otherwise, kq1 is a string containing the minimum of the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string a and the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string b, kq2 is a string containing the maximum of the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string a and the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string b, vt is 1, i is 1, x is the minimum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string a and the integer represented by the character at index i of string b, y is the maximum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string a and the integer represented by the character at index i of string b, kq1 is a string containing the minimum of the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string a and the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string b and the minimum of the integer represented by the character at index 1 of string a and the integer represented by the character at index 1 of string b, kq2 is a string containing the maximum of the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string a and the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string b and the maximum of the integer represented by the character at index 1 of string a and the integer represented by the character at index 1 of string b, and kq2 (containing the maximum of the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string a and the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string b and the maximum of the integer represented by the character at index 1 of string a and the integer represented by the character at index 1 of string b) is printed.**
