Postcondition: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000), stdin contains 2t - 2 strings, each representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, with the first t - 1 strings having the same length as the next t - 1 strings, q is 0, a is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9 and must have at least one digit, b is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9. If a[i] is equal to b[i], then kq1 is a string equal to the first digit of a, kq2 is a string equal to the first digit of a, vt is 0, and i is 0. Otherwise, kq1 and kq2 are strings representing the minimum and maximum digit of a[i] and b[i] respectively, vt is 1, and i is 0. In the latter case, if a[i] is greater than b[i], kq1 contains the minimum digit and kq2 contains the maximum digit. If a[i] is less than or equal to b[i], kq1 contains the maximum digit and kq2 contains the minimum digit.**
