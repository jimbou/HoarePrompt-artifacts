Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000), `stdin` contains 2t - 6 strings, each representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, with the first t - 1 strings having the same length as the next t - 1 strings, `q` is 2, `a` is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9 and has at least 1 character, `b` is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, `kq1` is an empty string, `kq2` is an empty string, `vt` is not equal to 0, `i` is less than the length of `a`, `x` is the minimum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string `a` and the integer represented by the character at index i of string `b`, `y` is the maximum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string `a` and the integer represented by the character at index i of string `b`. The character at index i of string `a` is not equal to the character at index i of string `b`.***
