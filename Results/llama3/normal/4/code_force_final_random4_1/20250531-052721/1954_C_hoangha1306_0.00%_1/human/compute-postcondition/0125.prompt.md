Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000), stdin contains 2t - 6 strings, each representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, with the first t - 1 strings having the same length as the next t - 1 strings, q is 2, a is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, b is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, kq1 is an empty string, kq2 is an empty string, vt is 0, i is equal to the length of a, x is the minimum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string a and the integer represented by the character at index i of string b, y is the maximum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string a and the integer represented by the character at index i of string b.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
        kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
        continue
    else:
        x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
        if vt == 0:
            vt = 1
            if a[i] > b[i]:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
            else:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
        else:
            kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000), stdin contains 2t - 6 strings, each representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, with the first t - 1 strings having the same length as the next t - 1 strings, q is 2, a is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9 and has at least 1 character, b is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, i is less than the length of a, x is the minimum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string a and the integer represented by the character at index i of string b, y is the maximum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string a and the integer represented by the character at index i of string b. If the character at index i of string a is equal to the character at index i of string b, then kq1 and kq2 are both strings representing the character at index i of string a. Otherwise, if the character at index i of string a is greater than the character at index i of string b, then kq1 is a string representing the minimum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string a and the integer represented by the character at index i of string b, and kq2 is a string representing the maximum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string a and the integer represented by the character at index i of string b. If the character at index i of string a is less than or equal to the character at index i of string b, then kq1 is a string consisting of one character, which is the maximum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string a and the integer represented by the character at index i of string b, and kq2 is a string consisting of one character, which is the minimum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string a and the integer represented by the character at index i of string b. Additionally, if vt is 0 and the character at index i of string a is not equal to the character at index i of string b, then vt is updated to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000), stdin contains 2t - 6 strings, each representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, with the first t - 1 strings having the same length as the next t - 1 strings, q is 2, a is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9 and has at least 1 character, b is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, i is less than the length of a, x is the minimum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string a and the integer represented by the character at index i of string b, y is the maximum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string a and the integer represented by the character at index i of string b. If the character at index i of string a is equal to the character at index i of string b, then kq1 and kq2 are both strings representing the character at index i of string a. Otherwise, if the character at index i of string a is greater than the character at index i of string b, then kq1 is a string representing the minimum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string a and the integer represented by the character at index i of string b, and kq2 is a string representing the maximum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string a and the integer represented by the character at index i of string b. If the character at index i of string a is less than or equal to the character at index i of string b, then kq1 is a string consisting of one character, which is the maximum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string a and the integer represented by the character at index i of string b, and kq2 is a string consisting of one character, which is the minimum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string a and the integer represented by the character at index i of string b. Additionally, if vt is 0 and the character at index i of string a is not equal to the character at index i of string b, then vt is updated to 1. Otherwise, vt remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000), stdin contains 2t - 6 strings, each representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, with the first t - 1 strings having the same length as the next t - 1 strings, q is 2, a is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9 and has at least 1 character, b is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, i is less than the length of a, x is the minimum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string a and the integer represented by the character at index i of string b, y is the maximum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string a and the integer represented by the character at index i of string b. If a[i] equals b[i], then kq1 and kq2 are both strings representing the character at index i of string a, and vt is either 0 or 1. If a[i] is not equal to b[i], then kq1 and kq2 are strings representing the minimum and maximum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string a and the integer represented by the character at index i of string b, respectively. If vt is 0, kq1 and kq2 are followed by the minimum and maximum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string a and the integer represented by the character at index i of string b, respectively. If vt is 1, kq1 is followed by the minimum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string a and the integer represented by the character at index i of string b, and kq2 is followed by the maximum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string a and the integer represented by the character at index i of string b, if a[i] > b[i], otherwise kq1 is followed by the maximum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string a and the integer represented by the character at index i of string b, and kq2 is followed by the minimum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string a and the integer represented by the character at index i of string b.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
