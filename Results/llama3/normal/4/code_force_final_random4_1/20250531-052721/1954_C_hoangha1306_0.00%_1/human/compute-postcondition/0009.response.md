Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000), stdin contains 2t - 2 strings, each representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, with the first t - 1 strings having the same length as the next t - 1 strings, q is 0, a is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9 and must have at least one digit, b is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, kq1 is an empty string, kq2 is an empty string, the current value of vt is 1, i is 0, x is the minimum of the integer values of a[i] and b[i], y is the maximum of the integer values of a[i] and b[i].**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `vt` has been changed to 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The input in stdin remains the same, and the values of `t`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `kq1`, `kq2`, `i`, `x`, and `y` are still as specified in the initial state.
