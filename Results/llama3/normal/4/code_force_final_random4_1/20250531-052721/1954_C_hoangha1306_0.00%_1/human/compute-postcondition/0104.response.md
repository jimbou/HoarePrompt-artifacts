Postcondition: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000), stdin contains 2t - 6 strings, each representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, with the first t - 1 strings having the same length as the next t - 1 strings, q is 2, a is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9 and has at least 1 character, b is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, i is less than the length of a, x is the minimum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string a and the integer represented by the character at index i of string b, y is the maximum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string a and the integer represented by the character at index i of string b. If the character at index i of string a is equal to the character at index i of string b, then kq1 and kq2 are both strings representing the character at index i of string a. Otherwise, if the character at index i of string a is greater than the character at index i of string b, then kq1 is a string representing the minimum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string a and the integer represented by the character at index i of string b, and kq2 is a string representing the maximum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string a and the integer represented by the character at index i of string b. If the character at index i of string a is less than or equal to the character at index i of string b, then kq1 is a string consisting of one character, which is the maximum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string a and the integer represented by the character at index i of string b, and kq2 is a string consisting of one character, which is the minimum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string a and the integer represented by the character at index i of string b. Additionally, if vt is 0 and the character at index i of string a is not equal to the character at index i of string b, then vt is updated to 1.**
