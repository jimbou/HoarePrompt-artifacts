Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000), stdin contains 2t - 4 strings, each representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, with the first t - 1 strings having the same length as the next t - 1 strings, q is 1, a is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, b is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, kq1 is an empty string, kq2 is an empty string, vt is 0, and i is equal to the length of a, and kq2 (an empty string) is printed
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
        kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
        continue
    else:
        x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
        if vt == 0:
            vt = 1
            if a[i] > b[i]:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
            else:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
        else:
            kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000), stdin contains 2t - 4 strings, each representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, with the first t - 1 strings having the same length as the next t - 1 strings, q is 1, a is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 1 character, b is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9. If a[i] is equal to b[i], then kq1 and kq2 are strings consisting of the first character of a. Otherwise, kq1 is a string containing the minimum or maximum of the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string a and the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string b, kq2 is a string containing the maximum or minimum of the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string a and the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string b, vt is either 0 or 1, i is 0, x is the minimum of the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string a and the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string b, y is the maximum of the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string a and the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string b, and kq2 (containing the maximum or minimum of the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string a and the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string b) is printed. Additionally, if vt is 0, kq2 contains the maximum of the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string a and the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string b if the character at index i of string a is greater than the character at index i of string b, otherwise kq2 contains the minimum of the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string a and the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string b. If vt is not 0, kq2 contains the minimum of the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string a and the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string b.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000), stdin contains 2t - 4 strings, each representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, with the first t - 1 strings having the same length as the next t - 1 strings, q is 1, a is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 2 characters, b is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9. If a[i] is equal to b[i], then kq1 and kq2 are strings consisting of the first character of a and the character at index i of string a. Otherwise, kq1 and kq2 are strings containing the minimum and maximum of the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string a and the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string b. If vt is 0, then if a[i] is greater than b[i], kq1 contains the minimum of the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string a and the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string b and the minimum of the integer represented by the character at index 1 of string a and the integer represented by the character at index 1 of string b, kq2 contains the maximum of the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string a and the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string b and the maximum of the integer represented by the character at index 1 of string a and the integer represented by the character at index 1 of string b, and kq2 is printed. If a[i] is not greater than b[i], then kq1 contains the minimum of the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string a and the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string b, followed by the maximum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string a and the integer represented by the character at index i of string b, kq2 contains the maximum of the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string a and the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string b, followed by the minimum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string a and the integer represented by the character at index i of string b, and kq2 is printed. If vt is not 0, then kq1 contains the first character of a and the minimum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string a and the integer represented by the character at index i of string b, kq2 contains the maximum of the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string a and the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string b and the maximum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string a and the integer represented by the character at index i of string b if vt is 0 and the character at index i of string a is greater than the character at index i of string b, otherwise kq2 contains the minimum of the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string a and the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string b and the minimum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string a and the integer represented by the character at index i of string b if vt is not 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000), stdin contains 2t - 4 strings, each representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, with the first t - 1 strings having the same length as the next t - 1 strings, q is 1, a is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 2 characters, b is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9. If a[i] is equal to b[i], then kq1 and kq2 are strings consisting of the first character of a and the character at index i of string a. If a[i] is not equal to b[i], then if vt is 0, kq1 and kq2 are determined based on whether a[i] is greater than b[i], and if vt is not 0, kq1 contains the first character of a and the minimum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string a and the integer represented by the character at index i of string b, kq2 contains the maximum of the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string a and the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string b and the maximum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string a and the integer represented by the character at index i of string b if vt is 0 and the character at index i of string a is greater than the character at index i of string b, otherwise kq2 contains the minimum of the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string a and the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string b and the minimum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string a and the integer represented by the character at index i of string b if vt is not 0. i is 3 if a[i] is equal to b[i], otherwise i is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
