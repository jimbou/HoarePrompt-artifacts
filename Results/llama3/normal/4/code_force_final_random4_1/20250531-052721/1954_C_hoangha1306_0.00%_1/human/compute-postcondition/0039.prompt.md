Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000), stdin contains 2t - 2 strings, each representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, with the first t - 1 strings having the same length as the next t - 1 strings, q is 0, a is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, b is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, kq1 is an empty string, kq2 is an empty string, vt is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
        kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
        continue
    else:
        x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
        if vt == 0:
            vt = 1
            if a[i] > b[i]:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
            else:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
        else:
            kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000), stdin contains 2t - 2 strings, each representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, with the first t - 1 strings having the same length as the next t - 1 strings, q is 0, a is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9 and must have at least one digit, b is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9. If a[i] is equal to b[i], then kq1 is a string equal to the first digit of a, kq2 is a string equal to the first digit of a, vt is 0, and i is 0. Otherwise, kq1 and kq2 are strings representing the minimum and maximum digit of a[i] and b[i] respectively, vt is 1, and i is 0. In the latter case, if a[i] is greater than b[i], kq1 contains the minimum digit and kq2 contains the maximum digit. If a[i] is less than or equal to b[i], kq1 contains the maximum digit and kq2 contains the minimum digit.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000), stdin contains 2t - 2 strings, each representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, with the first t - 1 strings having the same length as the next t - 1 strings, q is 0, a is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9 and must have at least two digits, b is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9. If a[i] is equal to b[i], then kq1 and kq2 are strings equal to the first digit of a, vt is 0, and i is 1. Otherwise, kq1 and kq2 are strings representing the minimum and maximum digit of a[i] and b[i] respectively, vt is 1, and i is 1. In the latter case, if a[i] is greater than b[i], kq1 contains the minimum digit and kq2 contains the maximum digit. If a[i] is less than or equal to b[i], kq1 contains the maximum digit and kq2 contains the minimum digit.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000), stdin contains 2t - 2 strings, each representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, with the first t - 1 strings having the same length as the next t - 1 strings, q is 0, a is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9 and must have at least two digits, b is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9. If a[i] is equal to b[i], then kq1 and kq2 are strings representing the first digit of a plus the second digit of a, vt is 0, and i is 3. If a[i] is not equal to b[i], then x is the minimum digit of a[i] and b[i], y is the maximum digit of a[i] and b[i], and i is 2. If a[i] is equal to b[i], then vt is 0, kq1 is a string representing the minimum digit of a[i] and b[i] followed by the maximum digit of a[i] and b[i], and kq2 is a string representing the maximum digit of a[i] and b[i] followed by the minimum digit of a[i] and b[i]. If a[i] is not equal to b[i], then vt is 1, and if a[i] > b[i], then kq1 is a string representing the minimum digit of a[i] and b[i] followed by the minimum digit of a[i] and b[i], and kq2 is a string representing the maximum digit of a[i] and b[i] followed by the maximum digit of a[i] and b[i]. Otherwise, kq1 is a string representing the minimum digit of a[i] and b[i] followed by the maximum digit of a[i] and b[i], and kq2 is a string representing the maximum digit of a[i] and b[i] followed by the minimum digit of a[i] and b[i].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
