Postcondition: ***t is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000), stdin contains 2t - 2 strings, each representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, with the first t - 1 strings having the same length as the next t - 1 strings, q is 0, a is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9 and must have at least one digit, b is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, kq1 and kq2 are strings representing the minimum and maximum digit of a[i] and b[i] respectively, the current value of vt is 1, i is 0, x is the minimum of the integer values of a[i] and b[i], y is the maximum of the integer values of a[i] and b[i], and kq1 and kq2 are assigned based on the comparison of a[i] and b[i]. If a[i] is greater than b[i], kq1 contains the minimum digit and kq2 contains the maximum digit. If a[i] is less than or equal to b[i], kq1 contains the maximum digit and kq2 contains the minimum digit. If vt is not equal to 0, kq1 is a string representing the maximum of the integer values of a[i] and b[i], kq2 is a string representing the minimum of the integer values of a[i] and b[i].***
