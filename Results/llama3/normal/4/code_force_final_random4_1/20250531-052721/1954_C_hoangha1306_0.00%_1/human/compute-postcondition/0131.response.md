Functionality: **This function takes an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) and 2t strings from standard input, where the first t strings have the same length as the next t strings. It then compares the corresponding characters of each pair of strings, and for each pair, it constructs two new strings: one with the smaller character at the first mismatch and the larger character at the second mismatch, and another with the larger character at the first mismatch and the smaller character at the second mismatch. The function prints these two strings for each pair of input strings.**
