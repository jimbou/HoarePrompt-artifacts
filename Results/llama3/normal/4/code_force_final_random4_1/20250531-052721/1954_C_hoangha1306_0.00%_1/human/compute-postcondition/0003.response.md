To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`. The loop will execute if `a` has at least one character. Since `a` is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, we can adjust its state to have at least one digit.

State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000), stdin contains 2t - 2 strings, each representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, with the first t - 1 strings having the same length as the next t - 1 strings, q is 0, a is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9 and must have at least one digit, b is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, kq1 is an empty string, kq2 is an empty string, vt is 0, i is 0**
