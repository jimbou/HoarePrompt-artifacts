Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000), stdin contains 2t - 2 strings, each representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, with the first t - 1 strings having the same length as the next t - 1 strings, `q` is 0, `a` is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9 and must have at least two digits, `b` is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, `x` is the minimum digit of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `y` is the maximum digit of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `kq1` and `kq2` are strings representing the minimum and maximum digit of `a[i]` and `b[i]` respectively, `vt` is 1 if `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, otherwise `vt` is 0, and `i` is 2.**

In this output state, the values of `x` and `y` are determined by the minimum and maximum digits of `a[i]` and `b[i]` respectively. The values of `kq1` and `kq2` are updated to represent the minimum and maximum digit of `a[i]` and `b[i]` respectively. The value of `vt` is updated to 1 if `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, otherwise it remains 0. The value of `i` is updated to 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
