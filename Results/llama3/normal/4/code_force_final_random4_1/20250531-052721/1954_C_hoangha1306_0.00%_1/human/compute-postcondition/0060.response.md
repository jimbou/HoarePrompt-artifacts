Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains 2t - 4 strings, each representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, with the first t - 1 strings having the same length as the next t - 1 strings, q is 1, a is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 1 character, b is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, kq1 is a string containing the minimum or maximum of the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string a and the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string b, kq2 is a string containing the maximum or minimum of the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string a and the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string b, vt is either 0 or 1, i is 0, x is the minimum of the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string a and the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string b, y is the maximum of the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string a and the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string b, and kq2 (containing the maximum or minimum of the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string a and the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string b) is printed. Additionally, the character at index 0 of string a is not equal to the character at index 0 of string b. If vt is 0, kq2 contains the maximum of the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string a and the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string b if the character at index i of string a is greater than the character at index i of string b, otherwise kq2 contains the minimum of the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string a and the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string b. If vt is not 0, kq2 contains the minimum of the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string a and the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string b.***
