Postcondition: ***t is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000), stdin contains 2t - 6 strings, each representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, with the first t - 1 strings having the same length as the next t - 1 strings, q is 2, a is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9 and has at least 1 character, b is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, i is less than the length of a, x is the minimum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string a and the integer represented by the character at index i of string b, y is the maximum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string a and the integer represented by the character at index i of string b, kq1 and kq2 are strings representing the minimum and maximum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string a and the integer represented by the character at index i of string b, respectively, and vt is 1. If a[i] > b[i], kq1 is followed by the minimum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string a and the integer represented by the character at index i of string b, and kq2 is followed by the maximum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string a and the integer represented by the character at index i of string b. Otherwise, kq1 is followed by the maximum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string a and the integer represented by the character at index i of string b, and kq2 is followed by the minimum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string a and the integer represented by the character at index i of string b.***
