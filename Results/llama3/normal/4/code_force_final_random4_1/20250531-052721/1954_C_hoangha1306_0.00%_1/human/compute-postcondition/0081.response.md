Postcondition: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000), stdin contains 2t - 4 strings, each representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, with the first t - 1 strings having the same length as the next t - 1 strings, q is 1, a is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 2 characters, b is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9. If a[i] is equal to b[i], then kq1 and kq2 are strings consisting of the first character of a and the character at index i of string a. If a[i] is not equal to b[i], then if vt is 0, kq1 and kq2 are determined based on whether a[i] is greater than b[i], and if vt is not 0, kq1 contains the first character of a and the minimum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string a and the integer represented by the character at index i of string b, kq2 contains the maximum of the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string a and the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string b and the maximum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string a and the integer represented by the character at index i of string b if vt is 0 and the character at index i of string a is greater than the character at index i of string b, otherwise kq2 contains the minimum of the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string a and the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string b and the minimum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string a and the integer represented by the character at index i of string b if vt is not 0. i is 3 if a[i] is equal to b[i], otherwise i is 2.**
