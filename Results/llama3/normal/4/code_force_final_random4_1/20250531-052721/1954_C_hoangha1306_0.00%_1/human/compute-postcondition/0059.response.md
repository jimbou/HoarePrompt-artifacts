Output State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000), stdin contains 2t - 4 strings, each representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, with the first t - 1 strings having the same length as the next t - 1 strings, q is 1, a is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 1 character, b is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, kq1 is a string containing the maximum of the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string a and the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string b, kq2 is a string containing the minimum of the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string a and the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string b, vt is not equal to 0, i is 0, x is the minimum of the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string a and the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string b, y is the maximum of the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string a and the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string b, and kq2 (containing the minimum of the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string a and the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string b) is printed. Additionally, the character at index 0 of string a is not equal to the character at index 0 of string b**

In this output state, the values of `kq1` and `kq2` have been updated based on the initial values of `x` and `y`, which represent the minimum and maximum of the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string `a` and the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string `b`, respectively. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
