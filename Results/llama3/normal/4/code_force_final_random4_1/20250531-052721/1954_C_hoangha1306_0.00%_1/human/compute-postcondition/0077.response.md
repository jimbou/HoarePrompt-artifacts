Output State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000), stdin contains 2t - 4 strings, each representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, with the first t - 1 strings having the same length as the next t - 1 strings, q is 1, a is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 2 characters, b is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9. If a[i] is equal to b[i], then kq1 and kq2 are strings consisting of the first character of a and the character at index i of string a. Otherwise, kq1 and kq2 are strings containing the minimum and maximum of the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string a and the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string b. If vt is 0, then if a[i] is greater than b[i], kq1 contains the minimum of the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string a and the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string b and the minimum of the integer represented by the character at index 1 of string a and the integer represented by the character at index 1 of string b, kq2 contains the maximum of the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string a and the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string b and the maximum of the integer represented by the character at index 1 of string a and the integer represented by the character at index 1 of string b, and kq2 is printed. If a[i] is not greater than b[i], then kq1 contains the minimum of the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string a and the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string b, followed by the maximum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string a and the integer represented by the character at index i of string b, kq2 contains the maximum of the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string a and the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string b, followed by the minimum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string a and the integer represented by the character at index i of string b, and kq2 is printed. If vt is not 0, then kq1 contains the first character of a and the minimum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string a and the integer represented by the character at index i of string b, kq2 contains the maximum of the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string a and the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string b and the maximum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string a and the integer represented by the character at index i of string b if vt is 0 and the character at index i of string a is greater than the character at index i of string b, otherwise kq2 contains the minimum of the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string a and the integer represented by the character at index 0 of string b and the minimum of the integer represented by the character at index i of string a and the integer represented by the character at index i of string b if vt is not 0. i is 2, x is the minimum of the integer represented by the character at index 2 of string a and the integer represented by the character at index 2 of string b, y is the maximum of the integer represented by the character at index 2 of string a and the integer represented by the character at index 2 of string b, vt is 1, kq1 is kq1 + str(y), kq2 is kq2 + str(x).**

In this output state, the code has modified the values of `kq1` and `kq2` by appending the values of `y` and `x` to them, respectively. The values of `t`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `x`, `y`, and `vt` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `2t - 4` strings, each representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, with the first `t - 1` strings having the same length as the next `t - 1` strings.
