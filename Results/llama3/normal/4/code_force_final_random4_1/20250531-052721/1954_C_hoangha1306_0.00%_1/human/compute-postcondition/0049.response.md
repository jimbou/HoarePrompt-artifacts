Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000), stdin contains 2t - 4 strings, each representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, with the first t - 1 strings having the same length as the next t - 1 strings, q is 1, a is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 1 character, b is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, kq1 is an empty string, kq2 is an empty string, vt is 0, and i is 0, and kq2 (an empty string) is printed. Additionally, the character at index i of string a is not equal to the character at index i of string b***
