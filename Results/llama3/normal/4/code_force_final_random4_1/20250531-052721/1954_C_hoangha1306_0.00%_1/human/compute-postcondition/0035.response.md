Postcondition: ***t is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000), stdin contains 2t - 2 strings, each representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, with the first t - 1 strings having the same length as the next t - 1 strings, q is 0, a is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9 and must have at least two digits, b is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, x is the minimum digit of a[i] and b[i], y is the maximum digit of a[i] and b[i], vt is 1, and i is 2. If a[i] > b[i], then kq1 is a string representing the minimum digit of a[i] and b[i] followed by the minimum digit of a[i] and b[i], and kq2 is a string representing the maximum digit of a[i] and b[i] followed by the maximum digit of a[i] and b[i]. Otherwise, kq1 is a string representing the minimum digit of a[i] and b[i] followed by the maximum digit of a[i] and b[i], and kq2 is a string representing the maximum digit of a[i] and b[i] followed by the minimum digit of a[i] and b[i].***
