Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000), stdin contains 2t - 6 strings, each representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, with the first t - 1 strings having the same length as the next t - 1 strings, `q` is 2, `a` is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9 and has at least 1 character, `b` is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, `i` is less than the length of `a`, `x` is the minimum of the integer represented by the character at index `i` of string `a` and the integer represented by the character at index `i` of string `b`, `y` is the maximum of the integer represented by the character at index `i` of string `a` and the integer represented by the character at index `i` of string `b`, `kq1` and `kq2` are both strings representing the character at index `i` of string `a` if the character at index `i` of string `a` is equal to the character at index `i` of string `b`, otherwise `kq1` is a string representing the minimum of the integer represented by the character at index `i` of string `a` and the integer represented by the character at index `i` of string `b`, and `kq2` is a string representing the maximum of the integer represented by the character at index `i` of string `a` and the integer represented by the character at index `i` of string `b`, and `vt` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `vt` is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
