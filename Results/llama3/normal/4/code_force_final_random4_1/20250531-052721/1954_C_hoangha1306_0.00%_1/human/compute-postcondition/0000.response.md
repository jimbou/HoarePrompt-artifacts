The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of `t` to be the integer accepted from the input. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by 2t strings. After the code is executed, the value of `t` is assigned to be the integer accepted from the input and stdin now contains 2t strings, each representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, with the first t strings having the same length as the next t strings.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000), stdin contains 2t strings, each representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, with the first t strings having the same length as the next t strings.**
