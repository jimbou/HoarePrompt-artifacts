Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000), stdin contains 2t - 2 strings, each representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, with the first t - 1 strings having the same length as the next t - 1 strings, `q` is 0, `a` is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9 and must have at least two digits, `b` is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, `x` is the minimum digit of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `y` is the maximum digit of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `kq1` and `kq2` are strings representing the minimum and maximum digit of `a[i]` and `b[i]` respectively, `vt` is 1, and `i` is 2.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `vt` is now 1, indicating that `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
