Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000), stdin contains 2t - 2 strings, each representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, with the first t - 1 strings having the same length as the next t - 1 strings, q is 0, a is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9 and must have at least one digit, b is a string representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, kq1 is an empty string, kq2 is an empty string, vt is 0, i is 0, x is the minimum of the integer values of a[i] and b[i], y is the maximum of the integer values of a[i] and b[i].**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains the same, stdin still contains 2t - 2 strings, each representing an integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, with the first t - 1 strings having the same length as the next t - 1 strings. The value of `q` is still 0. The strings `a` and `b` still represent integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9. The strings `kq1` and `kq2` are still empty. The value of `vt` is still 0. The value of `i` is still 0. Two new variables `x` and `y` are introduced, where `x` is the minimum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and `y` is the maximum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
