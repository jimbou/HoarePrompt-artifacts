Output State: **t is reduced by 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a binary string of length n, b is a binary string of length m, k is the number of times a character in a matches a character in b, i is equal to n, j is equal to m.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `t` is reduced by 1, and there are `t-1` test cases left in `stdin`. The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The value of `k` is the total number of times a character in string `a` matches a character in string `b`. The loop counter `i` is equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has iterated `n` times. The index `j` is equal to `m`, indicating that the inner while loop has iterated `m` times.
