Postcondition: ***t is reduced by 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer greater than 1, m is an integer, a is a binary string of length n, b is a binary string of length m. If j is less than m, then j is equal to m+1 and k is 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, with j equal to m and k equal to 0.***
