Functionality: **This function processes a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two binary strings a and b. It compares the characters in string a with those in string b, and prints the number of matching characters. The function does not return any value, but instead prints the count of matching characters for each test case. It processes all test cases provided in the input, one at a time, until all cases have been handled.**
