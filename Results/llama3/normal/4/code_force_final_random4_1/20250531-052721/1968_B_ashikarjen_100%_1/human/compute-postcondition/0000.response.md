Output State: **t is reduced by 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains three lines. The first line contains two integers n and m. The second line contains a binary string a of length n. The third line contains a binary string b of length m. n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a binary string of length n, b is a binary string of length m, k is 0, j is 0.**
