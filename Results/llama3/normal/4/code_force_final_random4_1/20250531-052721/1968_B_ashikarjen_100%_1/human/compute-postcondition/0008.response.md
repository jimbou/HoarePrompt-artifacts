Output State: **`t` is reduced by 1, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m`, `k` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is `m`.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `t` is reduced by 1, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m`, `k` is 0, `i` is 0, and `j` is equal to `m`. This means that the loop has iterated over the entire string `b` until it reached the end, without finding a match with the first character of string `a`.
