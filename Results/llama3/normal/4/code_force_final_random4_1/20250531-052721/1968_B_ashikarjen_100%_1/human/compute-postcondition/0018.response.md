Output State: **`t` is reduced by 1, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is an integer, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m` where `b[j]` is not equal to `a[i]`, `j` is less than `m` and is increased by 1, `k` is 1, and `i` is 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is reduced by 1, and there are `t-1` test cases left in the standard input. The length of the binary strings `a` and `b` remains the same, with `n` and `m` being integers. The condition that `b[j]` is not equal to `a[i]` still holds, but the value of `j` is incremented by 1. The values of `k` and `i` remain unchanged at 1.
