Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is reduced by 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer greater than 2, m is an integer, a is a binary string of length n, b is a binary string of length m. If j is less than m, then j is equal to m+1 and k is 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, with j equal to m and k equal to 0, i is 1
Code of the loop:
while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
    j += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is reduced by 1, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `m` is an integer, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m` where `b[j]` must be different from `a[1]`, `j` is increased by 1 and is now equal to 2, `i` is 1
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is reduced by 1, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `m` is greater than 2, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m` where `b[j]` must be different from `a[1]` and `b[j+1]` must be different from `a[i]`, `j` is 3, `i` is 1
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is reduced by 1, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `m` is greater than 3, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m` where `b[j]` is not equal to `a[i]` and `b[j+1]` must be different from `a[i]`, `j` is 4, `i` is 1


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
