Postcondition: ***`t` is reduced by 1, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, then `k` is 1, `i` is 0, and `j` is either equal to `m` or still less than `m` but closer to `m`. Otherwise, `k` is 0, `i` is 0, and `j` is equal to `m` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
