Output State: **`t` is reduced by 1, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `m` must be at least 3, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m` where the first character is not equal to the first character of `a`, `k` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 3**

In this output state, the value of `j` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `j` being equal to 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `t` is reduced by 1, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `m` must be at least 3, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m` where the first character is not equal to the first character of `a`, `k` is 0, and `i` is 0 still holds true.
