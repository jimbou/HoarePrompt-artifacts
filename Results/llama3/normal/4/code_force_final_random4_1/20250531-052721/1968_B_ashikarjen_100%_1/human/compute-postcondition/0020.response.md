Output State: **`t` is reduced by 1, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m` where `b[j]` is not equal to `a[i]`, `j` is less than `m` and is increased by 1 to `j+1`, `k` is 1, and `i` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `j` has been incremented by 1, so it is now `j+1`. All other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `b[j]` is not equal to `a[i]` still holds, but now `j` has a new value.
