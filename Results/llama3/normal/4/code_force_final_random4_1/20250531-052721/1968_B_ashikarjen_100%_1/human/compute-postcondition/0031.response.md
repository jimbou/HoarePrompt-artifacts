Output State: **`t` is reduced by 1, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `m` is greater than 2, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m` where `b[j]` must be different from `a[1]` and `b[j+1]` must be different from `a[i]`, `j` is 3, `i` is 1**

The code increments the value of `j` by 1, so `j` is now 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `b[j]` must be different from `a[1]` and `b[j+1]` must be different from `a[i]` is still valid, but now `j` is 3, so `b[3]` must be different from `a[1]` and `b[4]` must be different from `a[1]`.
