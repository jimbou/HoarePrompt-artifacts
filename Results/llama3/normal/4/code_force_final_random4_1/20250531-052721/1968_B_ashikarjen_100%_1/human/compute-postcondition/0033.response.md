Output State: **`t` is reduced by 1, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `m` is greater than 3, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m` where `b[j]` is not equal to `a[i]` and `b[j+1]` must be different from `a[i]`, `j` is 4, `i` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `j` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 4. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions on `a` and `b` are still valid, as the increment of `j` does not affect the relationship between `a` and `b`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `i` are still the same as in the initial state.
