Postcondition: ***t is reduced by 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer greater than 2, m is an integer, a is a binary string of length n, b is a binary string of length m where b[j] is equal to a[i], j is equal to m, i is 1. If j is less than m, k is increased by 1 and j is increased by 1. Otherwise, stdin contains t-2 test cases and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
