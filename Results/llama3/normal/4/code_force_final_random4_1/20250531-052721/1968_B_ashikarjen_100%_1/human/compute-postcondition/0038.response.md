Output State: **`t` is reduced by 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `m` is an integer, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m` where `b[j]` is equal to `a[i]`, `j` is equal to `m`, `i` is 1, and `j` is not less than `m`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and `j` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that `t` is reduced by 1, and the number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 1 as well. Additionally, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
