Output State: **`t` is reduced by 1, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is an integer, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m`, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `k` is 1, and `i` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `j` has been incremented by 1, so it is now less than or equal to `m`. The other variables remain unchanged.
