Output State: **`t` is reduced by 1, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `m` is an integer, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m` where `b[j]` must be different from `a[1]`, `j` is increased by 1 and is now equal to 2, `i` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `j` has been incremented by 1, so it is now equal to 2. All other variables remain unchanged. The conditions on `b[j]` and `a[1]` are still valid, but now `j` has a specific value of 2.
