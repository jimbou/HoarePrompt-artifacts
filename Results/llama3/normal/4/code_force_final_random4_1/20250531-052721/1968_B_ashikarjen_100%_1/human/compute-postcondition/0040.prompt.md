Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is reduced by 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains three lines. The first line contains two integers n and m. The second line contains a binary string a of length n. The third line contains a binary string b of length m. n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a binary string of length n, b is a binary string of length m, k is 0, j is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
        j += 1
    if j < m:
        k += 1
        j += 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is reduced by 1, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, then `k` is 1, `i` is 0, and `j` is either equal to `m` or still less than `m` but closer to `m`. Otherwise, `k` is 0, `i` is 0, and `j` is equal to `m` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is reduced by 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer greater than 1, m is an integer, a is a binary string of length n, b is a binary string of length m. If j is less than m, then j is equal to m+1 and k is 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, with j equal to m and k equal to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is reduced by 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer greater than 2, m is an integer, a is a binary string of length n, b is a binary string of length m where b[j] is equal to a[i], j is equal to m, i is 1. If j is less than m, k is increased by 1 and j is increased by 1. Otherwise, stdin contains t-2 test cases and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
