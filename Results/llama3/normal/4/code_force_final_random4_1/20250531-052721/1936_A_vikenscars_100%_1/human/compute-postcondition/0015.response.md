Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `func_1` is a function that takes four non-negative integers less than `n` as input and returns a string that is either '<', '>', or '=', `max_item_idx` is `n-1` if `ans` is '<', otherwise `max_item_idx` is a value between 0 and `n-2`, `pair_idx` is `max_item_idx`, and `ans` is either '<', '>', or '=' and equals to `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, n-1, n-1)`**

In this output state, the value of `pair_idx` is updated to be equal to `max_item_idx`, which is either `n-1` if `ans` is '<', or a value between 0 and `n-2` otherwise. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
