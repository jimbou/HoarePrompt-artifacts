The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `func_1` is a function that takes four non-negative integers less than `n` as input and returns a string that is either '<', '>', or '=', `max_item_idx` is `n-1` if `ans` is '<', otherwise `max_item_idx` is a value between 0 and `n-2`, `ans` is either '<', '>', or '=' and equals to `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, n-1, n-1)`. If `ans1` is '<', then `pair_idx` is 0. If `ans1` is either '>' or '=', then `ans1` equals to `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, max_item_idx, 0)`, and if `ans1` is '=', then `ans2` is '=' and equals to `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, 0, 0)`. If `ans2` is '>', then `pair_idx` is 0. Otherwise, `pair_idx` is `max_item_idx`.**
