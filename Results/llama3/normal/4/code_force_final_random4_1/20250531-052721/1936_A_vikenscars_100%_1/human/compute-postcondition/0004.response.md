The code assigns the value of `i` to `max_item_idx`. Since `i` is 1, `max_item_idx` is now 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `func_1` is a function that takes four non-negative integers less than `n` as input and returns a string that is either '<', '>', or '=', `max_item_idx` is 1, and the current value of `ans` is '<'.**
