Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is designed to solve the interactive problem of finding two indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i ⊕ p_j` is maximized, where `p` is a secret permutation of `{0, 1, ..., n-1}`. The program uses two functions: `func_1` to ask queries and get the result of the comparison between `(p_a | p_b)` and `(p_c | p_d)`, and `func_2` to find the pair of indices `i` and `j` that maximizes `p_i ⊕ p_j`.

The program works as follows:

1. `func_2` first finds the index `max_item_idx` of the maximum element in the permutation `p` by comparing each element with the current maximum element.
2. Then, it finds the index `pair_idx` of the element that maximizes `p_i ⊕ p_j` by comparing each element with the current maximum element and the element at index `pair_idx`.
3. Finally, it prints the pair of indices `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx` that maximizes `p_i ⊕ p_j`.

The program uses at most `3n` queries, which is within the allowed limit.

After analyzing the program, I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work correctly. The program correctly implements the logic to find the pair of indices that maximizes `p_i ⊕ p_j` using the allowed queries. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
