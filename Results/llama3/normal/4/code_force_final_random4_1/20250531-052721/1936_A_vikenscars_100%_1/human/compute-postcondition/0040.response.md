Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `func_1` is a function that takes four non-negative integers less than `n` as input and returns a string that is either '<', '>', or '=', `max_item_idx` is `n-1` if `ans` is '<', otherwise `max_item_idx` is a value between 0 and `n-2`, `ans` is either '<', '>', or '=' and equals to `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, n-1, n-1)`, `ans1` is either '<', '>', or '=' and equals to `func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)`, `pair_idx` is 2, `ans2` is either '<', '>', or '=' and equals to `func_1(pair_idx, pair_idx, i, i)`**

The code assigns the value of `i` (which is 2) to `pair_idx`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The output state is the same as the initial state, except that `pair_idx` is now 2.
