Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `func_1` is a function that takes four non-negative integers less than `n` as input and returns a string that is either '<', '>', or '=', `ans` is either '<', '>', or '='. If `ans` is '<', then `max_item_idx` is 3 and `ans` equals to `func_1(3, 3, 3, 3)`. Otherwise, `max_item_idx` is 2 if `ans` is '<', otherwise `max_item_idx` is 0 or 1 and `ans` equals to `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, 3, 3)`***
