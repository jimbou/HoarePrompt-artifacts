Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 0, `func_1` is a function that takes four non-negative integers less than `n` as input and returns a string that is either '<', '>', or '=', `max_item_idx` is `n-1` if `ans` is '<', otherwise `max_item_idx` is a value between 0 and `n-2`, `pair_idx` is `max_item_idx`, `ans` is either '<', '>', or '=' and equals to `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, n-1, n-1)`, `ans1` is '=' and equals to `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, max_item_idx, 0)`, and `ans2` is '=' and equals to `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, 0, 0)`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n`, `max_item_idx`, `pair_idx`, `ans`, and `ans1` remains the same as in the initial state. The value of `i` is still 0. The value of `ans2` is '=' and is equal to the result of calling `func_1` with arguments `max_item_idx`, `max_item_idx`, 0, and 0.
