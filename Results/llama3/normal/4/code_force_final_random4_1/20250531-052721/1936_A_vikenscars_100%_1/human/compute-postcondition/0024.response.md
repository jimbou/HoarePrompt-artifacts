Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 0, `func_1` is a function that takes four non-negative integers less than `n` as input and returns a string that is either '<', '>', or '=', `max_item_idx` is `n-1` if `ans` is '<', otherwise `max_item_idx` is a value between 0 and `n-2`, `pair_idx` is 0, `ans` is either '<', '>', or '=' and equals to `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, n-1, n-1)`, `ans1` is '=' and equals to `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, max_item_idx, 0)`, and `ans2` is '=' and equals to `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, 0, 0)` but its current value is '>'**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `pair_idx` is updated to 0, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The function `func_1` still takes four non-negative integers less than `n` as input and returns a string that is either '<', '>', or '='. The value of `max_item_idx` is still dependent on the value of `ans`. The values of `ans`, `ans1`, and `ans2` are still equal to the results of calling `func_1` with specific arguments, but the current value of `ans2` is '>' which is inconsistent with its definition.
