Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `func_1` is a function that takes four non-negative integers less than `n` as input and returns a string that is either '<', '>', or '=', `max_item_idx` is `n-1` if `ans` is '<', otherwise `max_item_idx` is a value between 0 and `n-2`, `ans` is either '<', '>', or '=' and equals to `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, n-1, n-1)`, `ans1` is either '<', '>', or '=' and equals to `func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)`, `ans2` is either '<', '>', or '=' and equals to `func_1(pair_idx, pair_idx, i, i)` if `ans1` is '=', otherwise `ans2` is either '<', '>', or '=' and equals to `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, 0, 0)` if `ans1` is '>', otherwise `ans2` is not defined. If `ans1` is '<', then `pair_idx` is `n-1`. If `ans1` is '=', then `ans2` is either '<', '>', or '=' and if `ans2` is '>', then `pair_idx` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `pair_idx` can be any value between 0 and `n-1` or `max_item_idx`.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the variables have reached their final values. The loop counter `i` has reached `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The values of `func_1`, `max_item_idx`, and `ans` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop. The values of `ans1` and `ans2` are determined by the last iteration of the loop, and `pair_idx` is updated accordingly. If `ans1` is '<', then `pair_idx` is set to `n-1`. If `ans1` is '=', then `ans2` is evaluated, and if it is '>', then `pair_idx` is set to `n-1`. Otherwise, `pair_idx` can take any value between 0 and `n-1` or `max_item_idx`.
