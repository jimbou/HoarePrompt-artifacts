Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 0, `func_1` is a function that takes four non-negative integers less than `n` as input and returns a string that is either '<', '>', or '=', `max_item_idx` is `n-1` if `ans` is '<', otherwise `max_item_idx` is a value between 0 and `n-2`, `pair_idx` is `max_item_idx`, `ans` is either '<', '>', or '=' and equals to `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, n-1, n-1)`, and `ans1` is either '<', '>', or '=' and equals to `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, max_item_idx, 0)`**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `i`, `func_1`, `max_item_idx`, `pair_idx`, and `ans` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is the introduction of a new variable `ans1`, which is assigned the result of calling `func_1` with the arguments `max_item_idx`, `max_item_idx`, `max_item_idx`, and `i` (which is 0). The value of `ans1` is either '<', '>', or '=' and is determined by the output of the `func_1` function.
