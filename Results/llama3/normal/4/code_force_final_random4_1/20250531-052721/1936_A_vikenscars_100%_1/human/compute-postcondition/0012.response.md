Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `func_1` is a function that takes four non-negative integers less than `n` as input and returns a string that is either '<', '>', or '=', `max_item_idx` is 3, and `ans` is either '<', '>', or '=' and equals to `func_1(3, 3, 3, 3)`**

In this output state, the value of `max_item_idx` has been updated to 3, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is still dependent on the result of `func_1`, but now it is evaluated with the new value of `max_item_idx`, which is 3.
