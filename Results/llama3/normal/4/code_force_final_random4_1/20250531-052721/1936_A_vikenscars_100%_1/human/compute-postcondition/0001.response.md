To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1, which is already given in the initial state. However, we need to adjust the state of `i` to ensure the loop can start.

Since the loop starts from `1` and goes up to `n-1`, we can set `i` to `1` to ensure the loop can execute.

The states of `func_1` and `max_item_idx` are not relevant to the loop head, so we don't need to adjust them.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `func_1` is a function that takes four non-negative integers less than `n` as input and returns a string that is either '<', '>', or '=', `max_item_idx` is 0**
