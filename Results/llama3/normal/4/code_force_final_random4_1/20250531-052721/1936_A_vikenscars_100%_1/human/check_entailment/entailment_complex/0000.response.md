Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve an interactive problem where the goal is to find two indices `i` and `j` in a secret sequence `p` such that `p_i` XOR `p_j` is maximized. The program uses a query function `func_1` to compare the bitwise OR of pairs of elements in the sequence.

The program first finds the maximum item index `max_item_idx` by comparing each element with the current maximum. Then, it finds the pair index `pair_idx` by comparing each element with the maximum item index. The pair index is updated if a greater pair is found.

The program prints the maximum item index and its pair index, which are the indices `i` and `j` that maximize `p_i` XOR `p_j`.

The program's logic is correct, and it uses at most 3n queries as required by the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
