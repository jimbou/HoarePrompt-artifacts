Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `func_1` is a function that takes four non-negative integers less than `n` as input and returns a string that is either '<', '>', or '=', `max_item_idx` is 2, and `ans` is either '<', '>', or '=' and equals to `func_1(2,2,2,2)` if `max_item_idx` is 2 otherwise `ans` equals to `func_1(0,0,2,2)`**

In this output state, the value of `max_item_idx` has been updated to 2, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is still dependent on the value of `max_item_idx`, but now it will be compared to 2 instead of 1.
