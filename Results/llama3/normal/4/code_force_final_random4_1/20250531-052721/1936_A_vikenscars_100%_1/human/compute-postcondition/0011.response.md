Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `func_1` is a function that takes four non-negative integers less than `n` as input and returns a string that is either '<', '>', or '=', `max_item_idx` is 2 if `ans` is '<', otherwise `max_item_idx` is 0 or 1, and `ans` is either '<', '>', or '=' and equals to `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, 3, 3)`**.

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the result of calling `func_1` with the current value of `max_item_idx` and the value of `i` which is 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `max_item_idx` is still dependent on the value of `ans`, and `ans` can take any of the three possible values '<', '>', or '='.
