To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `n` is already a positive integer greater than 1, we don't need to adjust it. However, we need to adjust `i` to be 0, which is the starting value of the range.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 0, `func_1` is a function that takes four non-negative integers less than `n` as input and returns a string that is either '<', '>', or '=', `max_item_idx` is `n-1` if `ans` is '<', otherwise `max_item_idx` is a value between 0 and `n-2`, `pair_idx` is `max_item_idx`, and `ans` is either '<', '>', or '=' and equals to `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, n-1, n-1)`**
