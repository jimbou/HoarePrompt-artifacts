To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `i` is now 2, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables, `func_1`, `max_item_idx`, and `ans`, are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `func_1` is a function that takes four non-negative integers less than `n` as input and returns a string that is either '<', '>', or '=', `max_item_idx` is 1 if `ans` is '<', otherwise `max_item_idx` is 0, and `ans` is either '<', '>', or '='**
