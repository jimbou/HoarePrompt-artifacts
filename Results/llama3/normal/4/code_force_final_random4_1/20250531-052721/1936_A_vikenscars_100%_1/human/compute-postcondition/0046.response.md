Based on the precondition, we can analyze the values of the variables involved in the print statement.

`max_item_idx` is either `n-1` if `ans` is '<', otherwise it is a value between 0 and `n-2`. Since `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `max_item_idx` can take any value from 0 to `n-1`.

`pair_idx` is either `n-1` if `ans1` is '<', otherwise it can be any value between 0 and `n-1` or `max_item_idx`. 

The print statement `print(f'! {max_item_idx} {pair_idx}')` will print an exclamation mark followed by the values of `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx`.

Since the exact values of `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx` depend on the values of `ans` and `ans1`, which are determined by the function `func_1`, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx`. However, we can describe their possible values based on the precondition.

Output: **! [max_item_idx] [pair_idx] (where max_item_idx is either n-1 or a value between 0 and n-2, and pair_idx is either n-1 or a value between 0 and n-1 or max_item_idx)**
