Output State: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `func_1` is a function that takes four non-negative integers less than `n` as input and returns a string that is either '<', '>', or '=', `max_item_idx` is `n-1` if `ans` is '<', otherwise `max_item_idx` is a value between 0 and `n-2`, `ans` is either '<', '>', or '=' and equals to `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, n-1, n-1)`, `ans1` is either '<', '>', or '=' and equals to `func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)`, `ans2` is either '<', '>', or '=' and equals to `func_1(pair_idx, pair_idx, i, i)` if `ans1` is '=', otherwise `ans2` is either '<', '>', or '=' and equals to `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, 0, 0)` if `ans1` is '>', otherwise `ans2` is not defined. If `ans1` is '<', then `pair_idx` is `n-1`. If `ans1` is '=', then `ans2` is either '<', '>', or '=' and if `ans2` is '>', then `pair_idx` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `pair_idx` can be any value between 0 and `n-1`, inclusive.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

*   The value of `n` remains unchanged, as it is not affected by the loop.
*   The value of `i` is now `n-1`, indicating that the loop has executed `n` times.
*   The function `func_1` remains unchanged, as it is not modified within the loop.
*   The value of `max_item_idx` depends on the value of `ans`, which is either '<', '>', or '='. If `ans` is '<', then `max_item_idx` is `n-1`; otherwise, it is a value between 0 and `n-2`.
*   The value of `ans` is either '<', '>', or '=' and is equal to the result of calling `func_1` with the arguments `max_item_idx`, `max_item_idx`, `n-1`, and `n-1`.
*   The value of `ans1` is either '<', '>', or '=' and is equal to the result of calling `func_1` with the arguments `max_item_idx`, `pair_idx`, `max_item_idx`, and `i`.
*   The value of `ans2` is either '<', '>', or '=' and is equal to the result of calling `func_1` with the arguments `pair_idx`, `pair_idx`, `i`, and `i` if `ans1` is '='. If `ans1` is '>', then `ans2` is equal to the result of calling `func_1` with the arguments `max_item_idx`, `max_item_idx`, 0, and 0. Otherwise, `ans2` is not defined.
*   The value of `pair_idx` depends on the values of `ans1` and `ans2`. If `ans1` is '<', then `pair_idx` is `n-1`. If `ans1` is '=', then `pair_idx` is `n-1` if `ans2` is '>'; otherwise, it can be any value between 0 and `n-1`, inclusive.
