Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `func_1` is a function that takes four non-negative integers less than `n` as input and returns a string that is either '<', '>', or '=', `max_item_idx` is 2 if `ans` is '<', otherwise `max_item_idx` is 0 or 1, and `ans` is either '<', '>', or '=' and equals to `func_1(2,2,2,2)` if `max_item_idx` is 2 otherwise `ans` equals to `func_1(0,0,2,2)`***
