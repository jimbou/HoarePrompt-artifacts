Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `func_1` is a function that takes four non-negative integers less than `n` as input and returns a string that is either '<', '>', or '=', `max_item_idx` is `n-1` if `ans` is '<', otherwise `max_item_idx` is a value between 0 and `n-2`, and `ans` is either '<', '>', or '=' and equals to `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, n-1, n-1)`**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `n-1`, which is the last value in the range from 1 to `n-1`. The value of `max_item_idx` will be `n-1` if the last comparison result `ans` is '<', indicating that the maximum item index has been updated to the last index. Otherwise, `max_item_idx` will be a value between 0 and `n-2`, indicating that the maximum item index has not been updated in the last iteration. The value of `ans` will be either '<', '>', or '=' and will be equal to the result of the last comparison `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, n-1, n-1)`.
