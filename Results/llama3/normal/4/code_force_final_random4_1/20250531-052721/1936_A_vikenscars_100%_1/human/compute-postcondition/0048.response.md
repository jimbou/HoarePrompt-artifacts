Functionality: **This function finds the maximum item index and its pair index based on the comparison results from the input function `func_1`. It iterates through the range of `n` to find the maximum item index and then finds its pair index by comparing with other items. The function prints the maximum item index and its pair index. The maximum item index can be either `n-1` or a value between 0 and `n-2`, and the pair index can be either `n-1` or a value between 0 and `n-1` or the maximum item index.**
