The value of `ans` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)`. Since `max_item_idx` is 0 and `i` is 1, the value of `ans` is the value returned by `func_1(0, 0, 1, 1)`. The value returned by `func_1(0, 0, 1, 1)` is either '<', '>', or '='. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `func_1` is a function that takes four non-negative integers less than `n` as input and returns a string that is either '<', '>', or '=', `max_item_idx` is 0, and `ans` is either '<', '>', or '='.
