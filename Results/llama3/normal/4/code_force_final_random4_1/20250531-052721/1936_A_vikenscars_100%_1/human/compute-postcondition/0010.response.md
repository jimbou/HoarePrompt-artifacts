The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 3 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 3.
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `func_1` is a function that takes four non-negative integers less than `n` as input and returns a string that is either '<', '>', or '=', `max_item_idx` is 2 if `ans` is '<', otherwise `max_item_idx` is 0 or 1, and `ans` is either '<', '>', or '=' and equals to `func_1(2,2,2,2)` if `max_item_idx` is 2 otherwise `ans` equals to `func_1(0,0,2,2)`**
