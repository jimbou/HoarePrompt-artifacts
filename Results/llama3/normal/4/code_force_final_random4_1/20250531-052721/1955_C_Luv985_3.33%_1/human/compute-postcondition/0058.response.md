Postcondition: ***T is greater than or equal to 0, n is greater than 1, k is greater than 0 and is reduced by 2 * mi, a is a list of integers with the first and last elements reduced by mi, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1], and stdin is empty. If a[0] is 0, then l is 1, r is n - 1, and ans is 1. Otherwise, the values of l, r, and ans remain unchanged.***
