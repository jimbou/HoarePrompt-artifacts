Postcondition: **T is greater than or equal to 0, n is greater than 1, k is greater than 0 and is reduced by 2 * mi, a is a list of integers with the first and last elements reduced by mi, l is 0, r is n - 1, ans is 0, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1], and stdin is empty. The current value of a[l] is 0.**
