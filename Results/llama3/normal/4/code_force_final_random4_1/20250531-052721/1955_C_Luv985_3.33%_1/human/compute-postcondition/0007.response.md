Postcondition: **T is at least 0, n is greater than 1, k is greater than 0 and is equal to its original value minus 2 * mi, a is a list of integers where a[0] is equal to its original value minus mi and a[n - 1] is equal to its original value minus mi, l is 0, r is n - 1, ans is 0, mi is the minimum of (a[0] - mi) and (a[n - 1] - mi), stdin is empty. The current value of a[l] is 0.**
