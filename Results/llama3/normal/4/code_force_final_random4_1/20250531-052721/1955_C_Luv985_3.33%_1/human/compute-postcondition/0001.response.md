To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the loop condition, which is `while T:`. This implies that the loop will execute as long as `T` is not zero.

Given the state right before the loop:

- `T` is an integer equal to the first input from stdin.
- stdin contains `t-1` test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= k <= 10^15). The second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).

The only variable in the loop head is `T`. For the loop to execute at least once, `T` must be greater than 0. Since `T` is defined as an integer equal to the first input from stdin, and given that stdin contains `t-1` test cases, it implies that `T` represents the total number of test cases. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `T` must be at least 1.

State: **`T` must be at least 1**
