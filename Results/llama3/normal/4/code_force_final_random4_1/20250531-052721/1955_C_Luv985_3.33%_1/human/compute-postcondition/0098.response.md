Output: **T is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer, k is 0, a is a list of integers, l is either 0 or n, r is either 0 or n - 1, ans is an integer, stdin is empty. If l is equal to r, ans is increased by 1 if a[l] is less than or equal to 0, otherwise, ans remains the same, and the value of ans is being printed**
