Output State: **T is at least 0, n is greater than 1, k is greater than 0, a is a list of integers, l is 0 or 1, r is n - 1 or n - 2, ans is either 1, 2 or 3, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r], t is either 0 or 1, stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, so it can now be 1, 2, or 3. The values of the other variables remain the same. The input buffer is still empty.
