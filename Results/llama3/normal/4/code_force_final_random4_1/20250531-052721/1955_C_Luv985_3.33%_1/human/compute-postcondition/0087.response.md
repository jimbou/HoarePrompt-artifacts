Postcondition: ***T is greater than or equal to 0, n is greater than 1, k is greater than 0 and is reduced by twice the original value of mi, a is a list of integers where the values at indices l and r are reduced by the original value of mi. If a[l] is 0, then l is either 1 or 2, r is greater than 1, if a[r] is 0, then ans is 2 or 3, otherwise ans is 1 or 2. If a[l] is not 0, then l is either 0 or 1, r is greater than 1, if a[r] is 0, then ans is 2 or 3, otherwise ans is 1 or 2. mi is the minimum of the new values of a[l] and a[r].***
