Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 2 * min(a[l], a[r]), `a` is a list of integers, `l` is less than `r`, `r` is `n - 1`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `t` is 0 if k is even and 1 if k is odd, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is determined by the parity of `k`, which is either 0 (if `k` is even) or 1 (if `k` is odd). The values of the other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin remains empty.
