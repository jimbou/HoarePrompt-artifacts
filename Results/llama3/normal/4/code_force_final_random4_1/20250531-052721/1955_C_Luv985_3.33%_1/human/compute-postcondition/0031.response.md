Postcondition: **T is at least 0, n is greater than 1, k is greater than 0, a is a list of integers, l is 0 or 1, r is n - 1 or n - 2, ans is either 0, 1 or 2, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r], stdin is empty. If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, then k is reduced by twice the minimum of a[l] and a[r], a is a list of integers with a[l] and a[r] reduced by the minimum of their original values. If a[r] is 0, then if a[l] is 0, l is 1 or 2, r is n - 1 or n - 2, ans is 2, 3 or 4, otherwise l is 0 or 1, r is n - 2 or n - 3, ans is either 1, 2 or 3. If a[r] is not 0, then if a[l] is 0, l is 1 or 2, r is n - 1 or n - 2, ans is 1, 2 or 3, otherwise l is 0 or 1, r is n - 1 or n - 2, ans is either 0, 1 or 2. mi is the minimum of the reduced a[l] and a[r]. If mi * 2 is greater than k, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the minimum of a[l] and a[r] minus T and half of k equals 0, then ans is either 1, 2 or 3. Otherwise, ans remains unchanged.**
