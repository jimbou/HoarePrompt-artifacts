Output State: **T is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer, k is 0, a is a list of integers, l is equal to n, r is -1, ans is an integer and is equal to ans + (0 >= a[n])**


In natural language, the output state is: T is still greater than or equal to 0, n is still an integer, k is still 0, a is still a list of integers, l is still equal to n, r is still -1, ans is still an integer but its value has been updated to be equal to its previous value plus the result of the expression (0 >= a[n]).
