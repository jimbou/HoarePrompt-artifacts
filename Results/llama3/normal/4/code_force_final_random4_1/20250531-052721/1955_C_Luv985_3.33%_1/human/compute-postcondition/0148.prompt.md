Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= k <= 10^15). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
while T:
    T -= 1
    n, k = input().split()
    n = int(n)
    k = int(k)
    a = input().split()
    a = list(map(lambda x: int(x), a))
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    ans = 0
    while l < r and k > 0:
        mi = min(a[l], a[r])
        if mi * 2 <= k:
            a[l] -= mi
            a[r] -= mi
            k -= mi * 2
            if a[l] == 0:
                ans += 1
                l += 1
            if a[r] == 0:
                ans += 1
                r -= 1
        else:
            t = k % 2
            if mi - t - k // 2 == 0:
                ans += 1
            break
    if l == r:
        ans += k >= a[l]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: T is at least 0, n is an integer, k is 0, a is a list of integers, l is n - 1, r is 0, stdin is empty. If l is equal to r, ans is either ans + 1 if a[0] is 0, or ans if a[0] is not 0, and the value of ans is being printed
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: T is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer, k is 0, a is a list of integers, l is either 0 or n, r is either 0 or n - 1, ans is an integer, stdin is empty. If l is equal to r, ans is increased by 1 if a[l] is less than or equal to 0, otherwise, ans remains the same, and the value of ans is being printed
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: T is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer, k is 0, a is a list of integers, l is n, r is -1, ans is an integer. If l is equal to r, ans is updated to ans + (0 >= a[n]), and the value of ans is being printed


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
