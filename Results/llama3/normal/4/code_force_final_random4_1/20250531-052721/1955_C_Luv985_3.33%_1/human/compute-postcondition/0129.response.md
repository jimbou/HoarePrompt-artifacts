Postcondition: ***T is greater than or equal to 0, n is greater than 1, a is a list of integers, l is less than r, r is n - 1, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r], stdin is empty. If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, then k is greater than 0, a[l] and a[r] are reduced by mi, and if a[r] is 0, ans is incremented by 1 and r is decremented by 1. Otherwise, k is greater than 2 * min(a[l], a[r]), and if k is even, t is 0, otherwise t is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
