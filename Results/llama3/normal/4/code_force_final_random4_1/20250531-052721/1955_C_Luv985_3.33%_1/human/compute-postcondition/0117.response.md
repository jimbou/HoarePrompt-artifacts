Postcondition: ***T is greater than or equal to 0, n is greater than 1, k is greater than 0, a is a list of integers, l is 0, r is n - 1, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1], stdin is empty. If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, then k is less than or equal to its original value minus 2 * mi, a[0] is its original value minus mi and a[n-1] is its original value minus mi. If a[r] is 0, then l is its original value, r is n - 2, ans is 2. If a[0] is 0, then the current value of l is 1. Otherwise, the values of l, r, and ans remain unchanged. If mi * 2 is greater than k, then ans is 1 if mi - t - k // 2 equals 0 otherwise ans is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
