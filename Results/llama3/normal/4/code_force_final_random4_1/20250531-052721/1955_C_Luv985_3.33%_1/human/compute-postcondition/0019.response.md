Postcondition: ***T is at least 0, n is greater than 1, k is greater than 0, a is a list of integers, l and r are either 0 or n - 1 or 1 or n - 2, ans is either 0, 1 or 2, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[n - 1] or the minimum of (a[0] - mi) and (a[n - 1] - mi), stdin is empty. If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, then k is decreased by 2 * mi, a[0] and a[n - 1] are decreased by mi, l is 1 if a[0] is 0 otherwise l is 0, r is n - 2 if a[r] is 0 otherwise r is n - 1, ans is 2 if a[0] is 0 otherwise ans is 1. Otherwise, ans is 1 if mi - T - k // 2 equals 0, otherwise ans is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
