Postcondition: ***T is at least 0, n is greater than 1, k is greater than 0 and at least 2 less than its original value, a is a list of integers with a[l] and a[r] each 1 less than their original values, l is 0, r is n - 1 or n - 2, ans is either 0, 1 or 2, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[n - 1] or a[n - 2], stdin is empty. If a[l] is 0, then l is 1, r is n - 1 or n - 2, ans is 1, 2 or 3. Otherwise, the values of l, r, ans remain unchanged.***
