Postcondition: ***T is greater than or equal to 0, n is greater than 1, k is greater than 0, a is a list of integers, l is either 0 or 1, r is greater than 0, ans is either 0 or 1, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[r]. If the minimum of a[0] and a[r] times 2 is less than or equal to k, then k is reduced by 2 times the minimum of a[0] and a[r], a[0] and a[r] are reduced by the minimum of their original values, and if a[l] is 0, then l is 1 and ans is 1. If a[r] is 0, then r is reduced by 1 and ans is increased by 1. Otherwise, if the minimum of a[0] and a[r] minus t minus k divided by 2 equals 0, then ans is 1. Otherwise, ans remains 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
