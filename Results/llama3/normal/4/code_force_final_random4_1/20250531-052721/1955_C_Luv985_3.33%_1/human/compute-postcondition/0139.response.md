Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is less than `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 1`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `k` is greater than 0, `t` is 0 if `k` is even and 1 if `k` is odd, stdin is empty. If `mi - t - k // 2` equals 0, then `ans` is increased by 1.***
