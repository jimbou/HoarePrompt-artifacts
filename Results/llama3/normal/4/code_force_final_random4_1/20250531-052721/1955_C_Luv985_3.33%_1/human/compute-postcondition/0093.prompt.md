Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, l is 0, r is n - 1, ans is 0, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
while l < r and k > 0:
    mi = min(a[l], a[r])
    if mi * 2 <= k:
        a[l] -= mi
        a[r] -= mi
        k -= mi * 2
        if a[l] == 0:
            ans += 1
            l += 1
        if a[r] == 0:
            ans += 1
            r -= 1
    else:
        t = k % 2
        if mi - t - k // 2 == 0:
            ans += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *T is greater than or equal to 0, n is greater than 1, k is greater than 0, a is a list of integers, l is 0, r is n - 1, ans is 0, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1], stdin is empty. If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, then k is reduced by 2 * mi, a is a list of integers with the first and last elements reduced by mi, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1]. If a[r] is 0, then l is 1 if a[0] is 0, otherwise l remains unchanged, r is n - 2 if a[0] is 0, otherwise r is reduced by 1, ans is 2 if a[0] is 0, otherwise ans is increased by 1, and a[r] is 0 if a[0] is 0, otherwise a[r] is the second last element of a. Otherwise, no changes are made to l, r, ans, and a[r]. If mi * 2 is greater than k, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If mi - t - k // 2 equals 0, then ans is 1. Otherwise, ans remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *T is greater than or equal to 0, n is greater than 1, k is greater than 0, a is a list of integers, l is either 0 or 1, r is greater than 0, ans is either 0 or 1, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[r]. If the minimum of a[0] and a[r] times 2 is less than or equal to k, then k is reduced by 2 times the minimum of a[0] and a[r], a[0] and a[r] are reduced by the minimum of their original values, and if a[l] is 0, then l is 1 and ans is 1. If a[r] is 0, then r is reduced by 1 and ans is increased by 1. Otherwise, if the minimum of a[0] and a[r] minus t minus k divided by 2 equals 0, then ans is 1. Otherwise, ans remains 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *T is greater than or equal to 0, n is greater than 1, k is greater than 0, a is a list of integers, l is either 0 or 1, r is greater than 1, ans is either 0 or 1, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r]. If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, then k is reduced by twice the original value of mi, a is a list of integers where the values at indices l and r are reduced by the original value of mi. If a[l] is 0, then l is either 1 or 2, r is greater than 1, if a[r] is 0, then ans is 2 or 3, otherwise ans is 1 or 2. If a[l] is not 0, then l is either 0 or 1, r is greater than 1, if a[r] is 0, then ans is 2 or 3, otherwise ans is 1 or 2. mi is the minimum of the new values of a[l] and a[r]. Otherwise, if mi * 2 is greater than k, then if mi - t - k // 2 equals 0, then ans is either 1 or 2. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
