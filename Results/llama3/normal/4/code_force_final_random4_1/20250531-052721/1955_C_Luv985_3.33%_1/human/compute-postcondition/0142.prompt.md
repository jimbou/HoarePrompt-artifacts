Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, l is 0, r is n - 1, ans is 0, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
while l < r and k > 0:
    mi = min(a[l], a[r])
    if mi * 2 <= k:
        a[l] -= mi
        a[r] -= mi
        k -= mi * 2
        if a[l] == 0:
            ans += 1
            l += 1
        if a[r] == 0:
            ans += 1
            r -= 1
    else:
        t = k % 2
        if mi - t - k // 2 == 0:
            ans += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *T is greater than or equal to 0, n is greater than 1, k is greater than 0, a is a list of integers, l is 0, r is n - 1, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1], stdin is empty. If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, then k is less than or equal to its original value minus 2 * mi, a[0] is its original value minus mi and a[n-1] is its original value minus mi. If a[r] is 0, then l is its original value, r is n - 2, ans is 2. If a[0] is 0, then the current value of l is 1. Otherwise, the values of l, r, and ans remain unchanged. If mi * 2 is greater than k, then ans is 1 if mi - t - k // 2 equals 0 otherwise ans is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *T is greater than or equal to 0, n is greater than 1, a is a list of integers, l is less than r, r is n - 1, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r], stdin is empty. If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, then k is greater than 0, a[l] and a[r] are reduced by mi, and if a[r] is 0, ans is incremented by 1 and r is decremented by 1. Otherwise, k is greater than 2 * min(a[l], a[r]), and if k is even, t is 0, otherwise t is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *T is greater than or equal to 0, n is greater than 1, a is a list of integers, l is less than n, r is n - 1 if a[r] is not equal to 0, otherwise r is n - 2, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r], stdin is empty, k is greater than 0 and decreased by mi * 2 if mi * 2 is less than or equal to k. If a[r] is equal to 0, then ans is increased by 1. If a[l] is equal to 0, then ans is increased by 1 and l is increased by 1. If mi * 2 is greater than k, then t is 0 if k is even and 1 if k is odd, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
