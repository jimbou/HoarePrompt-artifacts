Postcondition: ***T is greater than or equal to 0, n is greater than 1, k is greater than 0, a is a list of integers, l is 0, r is n - 1, ans is 0, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1], stdin is empty. If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, then k is reduced by 2 * mi, a is a list of integers with the first and last elements reduced by mi, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1]. If a[r] is 0, then l is 1 if a[0] is 0, otherwise l remains unchanged, r is n - 2 if a[0] is 0, otherwise r is reduced by 1, ans is 2 if a[0] is 0, otherwise ans is increased by 1, and a[r] is 0 if a[0] is 0, otherwise a[r] is the second last element of a. Otherwise, no changes are made to l, r, ans, and a[r]. If mi * 2 is greater than k, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If mi - t - k // 2 equals 0, then ans is 1. Otherwise, ans remains unchanged.***
