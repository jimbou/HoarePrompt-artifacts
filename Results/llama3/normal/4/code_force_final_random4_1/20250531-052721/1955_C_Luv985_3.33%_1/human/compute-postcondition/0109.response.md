Output State: **T is greater than or equal to 0, n is greater than 1, k is greater than 0 and less than or equal to its original value minus 2 * mi, a is a list of integers where a[0] is its original value minus mi and a[n-1] is its original value minus mi, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1], l is its original value, r is n - 2, ans is 2, stdin is empty. If a[0] is 0, then the current value of l is 1.**
