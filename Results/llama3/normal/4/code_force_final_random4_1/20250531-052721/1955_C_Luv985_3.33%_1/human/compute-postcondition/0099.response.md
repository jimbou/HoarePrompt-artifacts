The variable in the loop head is variable T, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable T.  If T is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, T is greater than or equal to 0, So for the loop to be executed one more time T must be greater than 0.
State: **T is greater than 0, n is an integer, k is 0, a is a list of integers, l is either 0 or n, r is either 0 or n - 1, ans is an integer, stdin is empty.**
