Postcondition: **`T` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, `t` is 0 if `k` is even and 1 if `k` is odd, `mi * 2` is greater than `k`, and `stdin` is empty. The current value of `mi - t - k // 2` equals 0.**
