Postcondition: ***T is greater than or equal to 0, n is greater than 1, k is greater than 0, a is a list of integers with a[l] and a[r] reduced by mi, l is less than r, r is n - 1, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r] after reduction, stdin is empty. If a[r] is 0, ans is incremented by 1 and r is decremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
