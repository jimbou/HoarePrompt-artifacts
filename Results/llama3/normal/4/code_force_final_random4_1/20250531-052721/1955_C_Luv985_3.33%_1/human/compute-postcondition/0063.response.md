Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, `t` is either 0 or 1, `mi * 2` is greater than `k`, and `stdin` is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is either 0 or 1, depending on whether `k` is even or odd. The other variables remain unchanged.
