Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is either 0 or 1, `r` is greater than 1, `ans` is either 1 or 2, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `t` is either 0 or 1.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, so it can now be either 1 or 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
