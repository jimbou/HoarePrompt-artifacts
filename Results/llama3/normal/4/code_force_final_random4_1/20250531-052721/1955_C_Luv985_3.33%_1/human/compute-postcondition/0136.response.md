Postcondition: ***T is greater than or equal to 0, n is greater than 1, a is a list of integers with a[l] and a[r] decreased by mi, l is less than n, r is n - 1 if a[r] is not equal to 0, otherwise r is n - 2, mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r], stdin is empty, k is greater than 0 and decreased by mi * 2. If a[r] is equal to 0, then ans is increased by 1. If a[l] is equal to 0, then ans is increased by 1 and l is increased by 1.***
