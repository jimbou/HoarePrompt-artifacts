Postcondition: ***T is at least 0, n is greater than 1, k is greater than 0, a is a list of integers, l is 0, r is n - 1 or n - 2, ans is either 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[n - 1] or a[n - 2], stdin is empty. If mi * 2 is less than or equal to k, then k is at least 2 less than its original value, a[l] and a[r] are each 1 less than their original values. If a[r] is 0, then r is n - 2 or n - 3. If a[l] is 0, then l is 1. Otherwise, the values of l, r remain unchanged. If mi * 2 is more than k, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If mi - T - k // 2 equals 0, then ans is either 1, 2 or 3.***
