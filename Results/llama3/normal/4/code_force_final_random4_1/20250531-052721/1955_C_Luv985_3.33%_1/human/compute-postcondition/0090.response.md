Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is either 0 or 1, `r` is greater than 1, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `t` is either 0 or 1. If `mi - t - k // 2` equals 0, then `ans` is either 1 or 2. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
