Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 2 * min(a[l], a[r]), `a` is a list of integers, `l` is less than `r`, `r` is `n - 1`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `t` is 0 if k is even and 1 if k is odd, stdin is empty. If `mi - t - k // 2` equals 0, then `ans` is increased by 1.***
