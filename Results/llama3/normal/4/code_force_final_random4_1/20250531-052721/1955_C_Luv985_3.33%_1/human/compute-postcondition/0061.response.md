Postcondition: ***T is greater than or equal to 0, n is greater than 1, k is greater than 0 and is reduced by 2 * mi, a is a list of integers with the first and last elements reduced by mi, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[n-1]. If a[r] is 0, then l is 1 if a[0] is 0, otherwise l remains unchanged, r is n - 2 if a[0] is 0, otherwise r is reduced by 1, ans is 2 if a[0] is 0, otherwise ans is increased by 1, and a[r] is 0 if a[0] is 0, otherwise a[r] is the second last element of a. Otherwise, no changes are made to l, r, ans, and a[r].***
