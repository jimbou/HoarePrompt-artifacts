Output State: **T is at least 0, n is greater than 1, k is greater than 0, a is a list of integers, l is 0, r is n - 1, ans is 0, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[n - 1], stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `mi` is the minimum of the first and last elements of the list `a`, which are `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]` respectively. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
