Postcondition: ***T is greater than or equal to 0, n is greater than 1, k is greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus 2 times the minimum of a[0] and a[r], a is a list of integers where a[0] and a[r] are reduced by the minimum of their original values, if a[l] is 0, then l is 1 and ans is 1, otherwise no changes are made to l and ans, r is greater than 0, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[r] after the reduction. If a[r] is 0, then r is equal to its original value minus 1 and ans is equal to its original value plus 1.***
