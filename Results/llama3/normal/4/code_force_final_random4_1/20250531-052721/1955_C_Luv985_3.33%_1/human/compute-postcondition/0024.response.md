Postcondition: **T is at least 0, n is greater than 1, k is greater than 0 and reduced by twice the minimum of a[l] and a[r], a is a list of integers with a[l] and a[r] reduced by the minimum of their original values, if a[l] is 0, then l is 1 or 2, r is n - 1 or n - 2, ans is 1, 2 or 3, otherwise l is 0 or 1, r is n - 1 or n - 2, ans is either 0, 1 or 2, mi is the minimum of the reduced a[l] and a[r], stdin is empty.**
