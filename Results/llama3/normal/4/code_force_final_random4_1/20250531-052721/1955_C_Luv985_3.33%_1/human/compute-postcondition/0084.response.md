Output State: **T is greater than or equal to 0, n is greater than 1, k is greater than 0 and is reduced by twice the original value of mi, a is a list of integers where the values at indices l and r are reduced by the original value of mi, l is either 1 or 2, r is greater than 1, ans is 1 or 2, mi is the minimum of the new values of a[l] and a[r].**

In this output state, the value of `ans` is incremented by 1, and the value of `l` is incremented by 1. The values of `T`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `r`, and `mi` remain unchanged.
