The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The value of `ans` can be 0, 1 or 2, so the value of `ans` is now 1, 2 or 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **T is at least 0, n is greater than 1, k is greater than 0, a is a list of integers, l is 0, r is n - 1 or n - 2, ans is either 1, 2 or 3, mi is the minimum of a[0] and a[n - 1] or a[n - 2], t is either 0 or 1, stdin is empty.**
