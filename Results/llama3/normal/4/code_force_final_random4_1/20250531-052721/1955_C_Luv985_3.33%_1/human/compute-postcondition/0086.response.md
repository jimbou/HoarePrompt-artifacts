Output State: **T is greater than or equal to 0, n is greater than 1, k is greater than 0 and is reduced by twice the original value of mi, a is a list of integers where the values at indices l and r are reduced by the original value of mi. If a[l] is 0, then l is either 1 or 2, r is greater than 1, ans is 2 or 3, mi is the minimum of the new values of a[l] and a[r]. Otherwise, l is either 0 or 1, r is greater than 1, ans is either 1 or 2, mi is the minimum of the new values of a[l] and a[r].**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `r` has been decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions on `l`, `r`, and `mi` are updated to reflect the new values of `a[l]` and `a[r]` after the reduction by the original value of `mi`.
