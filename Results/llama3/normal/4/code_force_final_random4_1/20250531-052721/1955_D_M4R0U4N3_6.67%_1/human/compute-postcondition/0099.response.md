Output State: **n is an integer that is greater than m, m is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, todo is a set of integers that includes the value of old, done is a set of integers that does not include the value of old, extra is a set of integers, _ is 1, j is m, r is equal to m+1, old is a[1]. If a[1] is in extra, then extra does not include a[1]. Otherwise, if a[1] is in done, then todo includes the value of a[1], otherwise todo does not include the value of a[1]. If a[r] is in todo, then todo does not include the value of a[r] and done includes the value of a[r]. Otherwise, extra includes a[r]. If the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k, then ans is 2. Otherwise, ans is 1 if the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k, otherwise ans is 0.**

The code first removes the value of `old` from the set `done` and then adds it to the set `todo`. This means that the value of `old` is moved from `done` to `todo`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `extra` and `ans` are still dependent on the values of `a[1]` and the number of elements in `done`, respectively.
