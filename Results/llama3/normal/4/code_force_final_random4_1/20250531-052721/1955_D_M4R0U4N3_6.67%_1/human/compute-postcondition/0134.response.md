Output State: **n is an integer, m is greater than 2, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, todo is a set of integers and does not include the value of a[j], done is a set of integers and includes the value of a[j], extra is a set of integers, _ is 2, j is 2, r is equal to n, old is a[n - m]. If a[n - m] is in extra, then extra does not include a[n - m]. Otherwise, if a[n - m] is in done, then todo includes the value of a[n - m], otherwise todo does not include the value of a[n - m]. If a[r] is in todo, then todo does not include the value of a[r] and done includes the value of a[r]. Otherwise, extra includes a[r]. If the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k, then ans is n - m + 1. Otherwise, ans is n - m if the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k-1, otherwise ans is n - m - 1. If old is in extra, then extra does not include a[n - m]. If old is in done, then todo includes the value of old and done does not include the value of old. If old is not in done, then todo does not include the value of old and done includes the value of old, and ans is printed, ans (where ans is n - m + 1 if the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k, otherwise n - m if the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k-1, otherwise n - m - 1).**

The provided code snippet modifies the sets `todo` and `done` by removing `a[j]` from `todo` and adding it to `done`. This change affects the conditions that determine the value of `ans` and the inclusion of `a[n - m]` and `a[r]` in the sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra`. The value of `ans` is determined based on the number of elements in `done` and is printed accordingly. The output state reflects these changes and the updated conditions for the sets and `ans`.
