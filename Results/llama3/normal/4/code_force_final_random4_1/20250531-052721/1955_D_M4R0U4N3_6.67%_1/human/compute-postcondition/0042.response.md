Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that is less than `n`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers that includes `old` if `old` is in `done` and `old` is not in `extra`, otherwise `todo` is an empty set, `done` is a set of integers that includes all elements of `a` that were in `todo` except `old` if `old` is in `done` and `old` is not in `extra`, otherwise `done` includes all elements of `a` that were in `todo`, `extra` is a set of integers that includes all elements of `a` that were not in `todo` and includes the value of `a[r]`, `_` is 0, `j` is `m-1`, `ans` is 2 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 1, `r` is equal to `m+1`, `old` is equal to `a[r - m]`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs.**

The code adds the value of `a[r]` to the set `extra`. The value of `a[r]` is added to `extra` regardless of whether it was already present in `todo` or not. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is still dependent on the number of elements in `done` and the value of `k`. The value of `old` is still equal to `a[r - m]`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs.
