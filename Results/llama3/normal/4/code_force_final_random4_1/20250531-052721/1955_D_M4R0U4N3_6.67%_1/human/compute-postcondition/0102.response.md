Output State: **n is an integer that is greater than m, m is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, todo is a set of integers that does not include the value of a[r], done is a set of integers that includes the value of a[r], extra is a set of integers, _ is 1, j is m, r is equal to m+1, old is a[1]. If a[1] is in extra, then extra does not include a[1]. Otherwise, if a[1] is in done, then todo includes the value of a[1], otherwise todo does not include the value of a[1]. If the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k, then ans is 2. Otherwise, ans is 1 if the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k, otherwise ans is 0. If old is in extra, then extra does not include a[1]. If old is in done, then todo includes the value of old and done does not include the value of old.**

The code removes the value of `a[r]` from the set `todo` and adds it to the set `done`. This means that `todo` no longer includes the value of `a[r]`, and `done` now includes it. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to `a[1]`, `old`, and `ans` are still valid, but their values may have changed due to the updates to `todo` and `done`.
