Postcondition: ***n, m, k, a, j, r+1 are integers. m is less than n. If the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k, then if a[r+1] is in todo, todo does not contain a[r+1], done contains a[r+1], and extra contains a[r+1] if a[r] is in todo, otherwise extra does not contain a[r+1]. If a[r+1] is not in todo, then if a[r - m] is in extra, a[r - m] is not an element of extra. If a[r - m] is in done, then todo contains a[r - m], done does not contain a[r - m], and extra contains a[r+1]. If a[r - m] is not in done, then todo does not contain a[r - m], done contains a[r - m], and extra contains a[r+1]. Additionally, a[r+1] is in extra. If the number of elements in done is less than k, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. If old is in done, then old is not an element of done. old is an element of todo. If the number of elements in done was greater than or equal to k, then ans is 2. If the number of elements in done was less than k, then ans is an integer.***
