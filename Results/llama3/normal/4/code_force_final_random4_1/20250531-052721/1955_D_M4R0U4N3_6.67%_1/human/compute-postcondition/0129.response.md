The only variable in the loop head is variable  j, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `m` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `m` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers, `_` is 2, `j` is 1, `r` is equal to `n`, `old` is `a[n - m]`. If `a[n - m]` is in `extra`, then `extra` does not include `a[n - m]`. Otherwise, if `a[n - m]` is in `done`, then `todo` includes the value of `a[n - m]`, otherwise `todo` does not include the value of `a[n - m]`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, then `todo` does not include the value of `a[r]` and `done` includes the value of `a[r]`. Otherwise, `extra` includes `a[r]`. If the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is `n - m + 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is `n - m` if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k-1`, otherwise `ans` is `n - m - 1`. If `old` is in `extra`, then `extra` does not include `a[n - m]`. If `old` is in `done`, then `todo` includes the value of `old` and `done` does not include the value of `old`. If `old` is not in `done`, then `todo` does not include the value of `old` and `done` includes the value of `old`, and `ans` is printed, `ans` (where `ans` is `n - m + 1` if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `n - m` if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k-1`, otherwise `n - m - 1`). If `a[j]` is in `todo`, then `todo` does not include the value of `a[j]` and `done` includes the value of `a[j]`. Otherwise, `extra` includes `a[j]`.**
