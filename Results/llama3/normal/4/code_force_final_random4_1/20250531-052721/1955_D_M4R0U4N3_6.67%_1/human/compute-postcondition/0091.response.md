Output State: **`n` is an integer that is greater than `m`, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers that includes `a[r]`, `_` is 1, `j` is `m`, `ans` is 1 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0, `r` is equal to `m`. If `old` is in `extra`, then `old` is removed from `extra`. Otherwise, if `old` is in `done`, then `todo` includes the value of `old`, otherwise `todo` does not include the value of `old`. `a[r]` is not in `todo`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the set `extra` now includes the value of `a[r]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
