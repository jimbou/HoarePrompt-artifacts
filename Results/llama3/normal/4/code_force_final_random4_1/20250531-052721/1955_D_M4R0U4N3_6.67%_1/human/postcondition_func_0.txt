This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three lines. It processes the input data to determine the number of valid subarrays that meet a certain condition, and prints the count of such subarrays for each test case. The function takes no explicit parameters and returns no value, but instead prints the result for each test case.
