Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers, `_` is 2, `j` is `m`, `r` is equal to `n`, `old` is `a[n - m]`, `ans` is 1 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise 0.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` is determined by the number of elements in the `done` set. If the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 1, otherwise it is 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
