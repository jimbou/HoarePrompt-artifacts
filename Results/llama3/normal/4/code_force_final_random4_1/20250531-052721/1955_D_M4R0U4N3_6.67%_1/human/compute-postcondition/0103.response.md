Output State: **`n` is an integer that is greater than `m`, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers that includes `a[r]`, `_` is 1, `j` is `m`, `r` is equal to `m+1`, `old` is `a[1]`. If `a[1]` is in `extra`, then `extra` does not include `a[1]`. Otherwise, if `a[1]` is in `done`, then `todo` includes the value of `a[1]`, otherwise `todo` does not include the value of `a[1]`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, then `todo` does not include the value of `a[r]` and `done` includes the value of `a[r]`. Otherwise, `extra` includes `a[r]`. If the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` is 1 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0. If `old` is in `extra`, then `extra` does not include `a[1]`. If `old` is in `done`, then `todo` includes the value of `old` and `done` does not include the value of `old`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `extra` is updated to include `a[r]`. All other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to `todo`, `done`, and `ans` are still valid, but their values may have changed based on the updated value of `extra`.
