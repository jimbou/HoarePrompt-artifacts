Postcondition: ***n is an integer, m is an integer that is less than n, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, todo is a set of integers that includes all elements of a that were in todo except a[r - m] if a[r - m] is in done and a[r - m] is not in extra, otherwise todo is an empty set, done is a set of integers that includes all elements of a that were in todo except a[r - m] if a[r - m] is in done and a[r - m] is not in extra, otherwise done includes all elements of a that were in todo, extra is a set of integers that includes all elements of a that were not in todo and includes the value of a[r] if a[r] is not in todo, otherwise extra does not include the value of a[r]. If old is in extra, then old is removed from extra. If old is in done, then todo includes old, done includes all elements of a that were in todo except old, and extra includes all elements of a that were not in todo and includes the value of a[r] if a[r] is not in todo. Otherwise, todo is an empty set, done includes all elements of a that were in todo, and extra does not include the value of a[r]. _ is 0, j is m, ans is 4 if the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k, otherwise ans is 3 if a[r - m] is in done, otherwise ans is 4 if the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k, otherwise ans is 3, r is equal to m+2, old is equal to a[r - m]. If a[r] is in todo, then todo, done, and extra are updated accordingly. Otherwise, a[r] is added to extra. If the length of done is greater than or equal to k, then ans is 4. Otherwise, ans is 3 if a[r - m] is in done, otherwise ans is 3.***
