Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer that is greater than `m`, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers, `_` is 1, `j` is `m`, `ans` is 1 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0, `r` is equal to `m`, `old` is equal to `a[m - m]` which is `a[0]`. The current value of `old` is in `extra`***
