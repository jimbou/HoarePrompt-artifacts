Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers with `a[j]` removed if `a[j]` was in `todo`, `done` is a set of integers with `a[j]` added if `a[j]` was in `todo`, `extra` is a set of integers that includes `a[j]` if `a[j]` was not in `todo`, `_` is 0, `j` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs. If `a[j]` is in `todo`, `todo` is updated by removing `a[j]` and `done` is updated by adding `a[j]`. Otherwise, `a[j]` is added to `extra`.***
