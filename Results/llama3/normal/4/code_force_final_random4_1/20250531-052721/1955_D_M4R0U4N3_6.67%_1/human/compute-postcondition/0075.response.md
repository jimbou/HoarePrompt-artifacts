Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that is at least 2 and less than `n`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers that includes `a[2]`, `_` is 1, `j` is 2, `ans` is `n-m+1` if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is `n-m` if `a[r - m]` is in `done`, otherwise `ans` is `n-m+1` if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is `n-m`, `r` is equal to `n`, `old` is equal to `a[r - m]`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the set `extra` now includes the value of `a[2]`, which is the third element of the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
