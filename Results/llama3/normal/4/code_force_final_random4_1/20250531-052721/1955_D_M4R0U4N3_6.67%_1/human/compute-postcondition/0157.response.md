Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `todo`, `done`, `extra`, `_`, `j`, `r+1`, and `ans` are integers. `m` is less than `n`. `old` is `a[r - m]`. If the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, then if `a[r+1]` is in `todo`, `todo` does not contain `a[r+1]`, `done` contains `a[r+1]`, `extra` does not contain `a[r+1]`, and `ans` is 2. If `a[r+1]` is not in `todo`, then if `a[r - m]` is in `extra`, `a[r - m]` is not an element of `extra`. If `a[r - m]` is in `done`, then `todo` contains `a[r - m]`, `done` does not contain `a[r - m]`, `extra` contains `a[r+1]`, and `ans` is 2. If `a[r - m]` is not in `done`, then `todo` does not contain `a[r - m]`, `done` contains `a[r - m]`, `extra` contains `a[r+1]`, and `ans` is 2. Additionally, `a[r+1]` is in `extra`. If the number of elements in `done` is less than `k`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `old` has been updated to `a[r - m]`, and the conditions related to `old` have been updated accordingly. The rest of the variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
