The code prints the value of `ans`, which is determined by the number of elements in the `done` set and the presence of `a[r - m]` in the `done` set.

Since `ans` is `n-m+1` if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `n-m` otherwise, the output will be either `n-m+1` or `n-m`.

However, without knowing the exact values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and the elements of the `done` set, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `ans`.

Therefore, the output will be either `n-m+1` or `n-m`, depending on the number of elements in the `done` set and the presence of `a[r - m]` in the `done` set.

Output: **n-m+1 or n-m (where n, m, and k are the given integers and done is the set of integers)**
