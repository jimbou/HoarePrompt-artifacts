Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `todo`, `done`, `extra`, `_`, `j`, `r`, `old`, and `ans` are integers. `m` is less than `n`. If the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, then if `a[r]` is in `todo`, `todo` does not contain `a[r]`, `done` contains `a[r]`, `extra` does not contain `a[r]`, and `ans` is 2. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, then if `old` is in `extra`, `old` is not an element of `extra`. If `old` is in `done`, then `todo` contains `old`, `done` does not contain `old`, `extra` contains `a[r]`, and `ans` is 2. If `old` is not in `done`, then `todo` does not contain `old`, `done` contains `old`, `extra` contains `a[r]`, and `ans` is 2. Additionally, `a[r]` is in `extra`. If the number of elements in `done` is less than `k`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
