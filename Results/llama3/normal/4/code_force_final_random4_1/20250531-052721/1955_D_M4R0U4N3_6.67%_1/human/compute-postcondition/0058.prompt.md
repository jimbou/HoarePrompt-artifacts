Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is an empty set, `done` is a set of integers that includes all elements of `a` that were in `todo`, `extra` is a set of integers that includes all elements of `a` that were not in `todo`, `_` is 0, `j` is `m-1`, `ans` is 1 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs.
Code of the loop:
for r in range(m, n):
    old = a[r - m]
    if old in extra:
        extra.remove(old)
    elif old in done:
        done.remove(old)
        todo.add(old)
    if a[r] in todo:
        todo.remove(a[r])
        done.add(a[r])
    else:
        extra.add(a[r])
    if len(done) >= k:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that is less than `n`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers that includes `old` if `old` is in `done` and `old` is not in `extra`, otherwise `todo` is an empty set, `done` is a set of integers that includes all elements of `a` that were in `todo` except `old` if `old` is in `done` and `old` is not in `extra`, otherwise `done` includes all elements of `a` that were in `todo`, `extra` is a set of integers that includes all elements of `a` that were not in `todo` but does not include the value of `old` if `old` is in `extra`, `_` is 0, `j` is `m-1`, `ans` is 2 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 1, `r` is equal to `m`, `old` is equal to `a[m-1]`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, then `a[r]` is not in `todo` and `a[r]` is in `done`. Otherwise, `a[r]` is in `extra`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that is less than `n`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers that includes `old` if `old` is in `done` and `old` is not in `extra`, otherwise `todo` is an empty set, `done` is a set of integers that includes all elements of `a` that were in `todo` except `old` if `old` is in `done` and `old` is not in `extra`, otherwise `done` includes all elements of `a` that were in `todo`, `extra` is a set of integers that includes all elements of `a` that were not in `todo` and includes the value of `a[r]` if `a[r]` is not in `todo`, otherwise `extra` does not include the value of `a[r]`, `_` is 0, `j` is `m-1`, `ans` is 3 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 2 if `old` is in `done`, otherwise `ans` is 3 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 2, `r` is equal to `m+1`, `old` is equal to `a[r - m]`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, and `old` has been removed from `extra` if `old` is in `extra`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer, m is an integer that is less than n, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, todo is a set of integers that includes all elements of a that were in todo except a[r - m] if a[r - m] is in done and a[r - m] is not in extra, otherwise todo is an empty set, done is a set of integers that includes all elements of a that were in todo except a[r - m] if a[r - m] is in done and a[r - m] is not in extra, otherwise done includes all elements of a that were in todo, extra is a set of integers that includes all elements of a that were not in todo and includes the value of a[r] if a[r] is not in todo, otherwise extra does not include the value of a[r]. If old is in extra, then old is removed from extra. If old is in done, then todo includes old, done includes all elements of a that were in todo except old, and extra includes all elements of a that were not in todo and includes the value of a[r] if a[r] is not in todo. Otherwise, todo is an empty set, done includes all elements of a that were in todo, and extra does not include the value of a[r]. _ is 0, j is m, ans is 4 if the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k, otherwise ans is 3 if a[r - m] is in done, otherwise ans is 4 if the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k, otherwise ans is 3, r is equal to m+2, old is equal to a[r - m]. If a[r] is in todo, then todo, done, and extra are updated accordingly. Otherwise, a[r] is added to extra. If the length of done is greater than or equal to k, then ans is 4. Otherwise, ans is 3 if a[r - m] is in done, otherwise ans is 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
