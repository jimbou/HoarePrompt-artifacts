To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `r`, `m`, and `n`. The loop will execute if `m` is less than `n`. 

State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers, `_` is 2, `j` is `m`, `r` is equal to `m`, `old` is `a[n - m]`, `ans` is 1 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise 0, `m` is less than `n`**
