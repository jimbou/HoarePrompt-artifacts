To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `j` and `m`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `m` is at least 1. Since `j` is the loop variable, it should be initialized to 0, which is the first value in the range.

State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that is at least 1 and less than `n`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers, `_` is 1, `j` is 0, `ans` is `n-m+1` if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is `n-m` if `a[r - m]` is in `done`, otherwise `ans` is `n-m+1` if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is `n-m`, `r` is equal to `n`, `old` is equal to `a[r - m]`**
