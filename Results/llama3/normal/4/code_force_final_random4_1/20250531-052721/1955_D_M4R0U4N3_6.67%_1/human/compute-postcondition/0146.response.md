Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `todo`, `done`, `extra`, `_`, `j`, `r`, `old`, and `ans` are integers. If `old` is in `done`, then `todo` contains `old`, `done` does not contain `old`, `extra` does not contain `old`, `ans` is 0 if the number of elements in `done` is less than `k`, otherwise 1, and `m` is less than `n`. If `old` is not in `done`, then `todo` does not contain `old`, `done` contains `old`, `extra` does not contain `old`, `ans` is 1 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise 0, and `m` is less than `n`.***
