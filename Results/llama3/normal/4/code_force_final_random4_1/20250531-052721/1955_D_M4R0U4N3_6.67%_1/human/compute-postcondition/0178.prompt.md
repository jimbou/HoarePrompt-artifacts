Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers, `_` is 2, `j` is `m`, `r` is equal to `n`, `old` is `a[n - m]`, `ans` is 1 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise 0.
Code of the loop:
for r in range(m, n):
    old = a[r - m]
    if old in extra:
        extra.remove(old)
    elif old in done:
        done.remove(old)
        todo.add(old)
    if a[r] in todo:
        todo.remove(a[r])
        done.add(a[r])
    else:
        extra.add(a[r])
    if len(done) >= k:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `todo`, `done`, `extra`, `_`, `j`, `r`, `old`, and `ans` are integers. `m` is less than `n`. If the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, then if `a[r]` is in `todo`, `todo` does not contain `a[r]`, `done` contains `a[r]`, `extra` does not contain `a[r]`, and `ans` is 2. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, then if `old` is in `extra`, `old` is not an element of `extra`. If `old` is in `done`, then `todo` contains `old`, `done` does not contain `old`, `extra` contains `a[r]`, and `ans` is 2. If `old` is not in `done`, then `todo` does not contain `old`, `done` contains `old`, `extra` contains `a[r]`, and `ans` is 2. Additionally, `a[r]` is in `extra`. If the number of elements in `done` is less than `k`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `j`, `r+1` are integers. `m` is less than `n`. If the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, then if `a[r+1]` is in `todo`, `todo` does not contain `a[r+1]`, `done` contains `a[r+1]`, and `extra` contains `a[r+1]` if `a[r]` is in `todo`, otherwise `extra` does not contain `a[r+1]`. If `a[r+1]` is not in `todo`, then if `a[r - m]` is in `extra`, `a[r - m]` is not an element of `extra`. If `a[r - m]` is in `done`, then `todo` contains `a[r - m]`, `done` does not contain `a[r - m]`, and `extra` contains `a[r+1]`. If `a[r - m]` is not in `done`, then `todo` does not contain `a[r - m]`, `done` contains `a[r - m]`, and `extra` contains `a[r+1]`. Additionally, `a[r+1]` is in `extra`. If `old` is in `done`, then `old` is not an element of `done`. `old` is an element of `todo`. If the number of elements in `done` was greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 3. If the number of elements in `done` was less than `k`, then `ans` is an integer incremented by 1. If the number of elements in `done` is less than `k`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n, m, k, j, r+1+1 are integers. m is less than n. If old is in extra, then old is not an element of extra. If the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k, then if a[r+1+1] is in todo, todo does not contain a[r+1+1], done contains a[r+1+1], and extra contains a[r+1+1] if a[r+1] is in todo, otherwise extra does not contain a[r+1+1]. If a[r+1+1] is not in todo, then if a[r - m+1] is in extra, a[r - m+1] is not an element of extra. If a[r - m+1] is in done, then todo contains a[r - m+1], done does not contain a[r - m+1], and extra contains a[r+1+1]. If a[r - m+1] is not in done, then todo does not contain a[r - m+1], done contains a[r - m+1], and extra contains a[r+1+1]. Additionally, a[r+1+1] is in extra. If old is in done, then old is not an element of done. old is an element of todo. If the number of elements in done was greater than or equal to k, then ans is 4. If the number of elements in done was less than k, then ans is an integer incremented by 1. If the number of elements in done is less than k, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. If old is not in extra, then if the number of elements in done was greater than or equal to k, then ans is 4. If the number of elements in done was less than k, then ans is an integer incremented by 1. If old is in done, then done does not contain old and old is an element of todo. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If a[r] is in todo, then a[r] is not an element of todo and a[r] is an element of done. Otherwise, extra contains a[r].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
