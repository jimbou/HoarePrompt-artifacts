Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `todo`, `done`, `extra`, `_`, `j`, `r+1`, and `ans` are integers. `m` is less than `n`. `old` is not an element of `extra`. If the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, then if `a[r+1]` is in `todo`, `todo` does not contain `a[r+1]`, `done` contains `a[r+1]`, `extra` does not contain `a[r+1]`, and `ans` is 2. If `a[r+1]` is not in `todo`, then if `a[r - m]` is in `extra`, `a[r - m]` is not an element of `extra`. If `a[r - m]` is in `done`, then `todo` contains `a[r - m]`, `done` does not contain `a[r - m]`, `extra` contains `a[r+1]`, and `ans` is 2. If `a[r - m]` is not in `done`, then `todo` does not contain `a[r - m]`, `done` contains `a[r - m]`, `extra` contains `a[r+1]`, and `ans` is 2. Additionally, `a[r+1]` is in `extra`. If the number of elements in `done` is less than `k`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `old` (which is equal to `a[r - m]`) is removed from `extra`. The conditions and relationships between the variables remain the same, but `old` is no longer an element of `extra`.
