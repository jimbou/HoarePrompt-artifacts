Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer that is less than n, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, todo is a set of integers that includes old if old is in done and old is not in extra, otherwise todo is an empty set, done is a set of integers that includes all elements of a that were in todo except old if old is in done and old is not in extra, otherwise done includes all elements of a that were in todo, extra is a set of integers that includes all elements of a that were not in todo but does not include the value of old if old is in extra, _ is 0, j is m-1, ans is 2 if the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k, otherwise ans is 1, r is equal to m+1, old is equal to a[r - m], stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, and old has been removed from extra if old is in extra. Otherwise, ans is 1 if old is in done, otherwise ans is 2 if the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k, otherwise ans is 1.**

The code removes the element at index `r` from the `todo` set and adds it to the `done` set. This means that the element at index `r` is no longer in `todo` and is now in `done`. The value of `ans` is updated based on the number of elements in `done`. If the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 2, otherwise `ans` is 1. The value of `old` is also updated to be equal to the element at index `r - m` in the list `a`. The value of `extra` is updated to exclude the value of `old` if it is in `extra`. The value of `j` is still `m-1`, and the value of `_` is still 0. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs.
