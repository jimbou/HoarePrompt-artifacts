State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that is less than `n`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers that includes `old` if `old` is in `done` and `old` is not in `extra`, otherwise `todo` is an empty set, `done` is a set of integers that includes all elements of `a` that were in `todo` except `old` if `old` is in `done` and `old` is not in `extra`, otherwise `done` includes all elements of `a` that were in `todo`, `extra` is a set of integers that includes all elements of `a` that were not in `todo` and includes the value of `a[r]` if `a[r]` is not in `todo`, otherwise `extra` does not include the value of `a[r]`, `_` is 0, `j` is `m-1`, `ans` is 3 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 2 if `old` is in `done`, otherwise `ans` is 3 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 2, `r` is equal to `m+2`, `old` is equal to `a[r - m]`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and `old` has been removed from `extra` if `old` is in `extra`.
