Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that is at least 1 and less than `n`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers that includes `a[j]`, `_` is 1, `j` is 1, `ans` is `n-m+1` if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is `n-m` if `a[r - m]` is in `done`, otherwise `ans` is `n-m+1` if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is `n-m`, `r` is equal to `n`, `old` is equal to `a[r - m]`.**

In this output state, the only change is that `a[j]` has been added to the `extra` set, indicating that `a[j]` is not in `todo` and has been included in `extra`. All other variables remain unchanged.
