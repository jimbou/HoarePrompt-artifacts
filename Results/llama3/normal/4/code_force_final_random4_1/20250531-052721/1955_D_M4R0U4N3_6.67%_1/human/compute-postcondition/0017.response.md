Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is an empty set, `done` is a set of integers that includes all elements of `a` that were in `todo`, `extra` is a set of integers that includes all elements of `a` that were not in `todo`, `_` is 0, `j` is `m-1`, `ans` is 1 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `todo`, `done`, `extra`, `_`, and `j` remain unchanged. A new variable `ans` is introduced, which is assigned a value of 1 if the number of elements in the set `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise it is assigned a value of 0. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs.
