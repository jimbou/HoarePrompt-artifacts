Output: **`n` is an integer that is greater than `m`, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers, `_` is 1, `j` is `m`, `r` is equal to `n`, `old` is `a[n - m]`. If `a[n - m]` is in `extra`, then `extra` does not include `a[n - m]`. Otherwise, if `a[n - m]` is in `done`, then `todo` includes the value of `a[n - m]`, otherwise `todo` does not include the value of `a[n - m]`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, then `todo` does not include the value of `a[r]` and `done` includes the value of `a[r]`. Otherwise, `extra` includes `a[r]`. If the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is `n - m + 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is `n - m` if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k-1`, otherwise `ans` is `n - m - 1`. If `old` is in `extra`, then `extra` does not include `a[n - m]`. If `old` is in `done`, then `todo` includes the value of `old` and `done` does not include the value of `old`. If `old` is not in `done`, then `todo` does not include the value of `old` and `done` includes the value of `old`, and ans is printed, ans (where ans is n - m + 1 if the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k, otherwise n - m if the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k-1, otherwise n - m - 1)**
