Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three lines. The first line contains three integers n, m, and k (1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6). The third line contains m integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_m (1 <= b_i <= 10^6).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    todo = set(map(int, input().split()))
    done = set()
    extra = set()
    for j in range(m):
        if a[j] in todo:
            todo.remove(a[j])
            done.add(a[j])
        else:
            extra.add(a[j])
    ans = 1 if len(done) >= k else 0
    for r in range(m, n):
        old = a[r - m]
        if old in extra:
            extra.remove(old)
        elif old in done:
            done.remove(old)
            todo.add(old)
        if a[r] in todo:
            todo.remove(a[r])
            done.add(a[r])
        else:
            extra.add(a[r])
        if len(done) >= k:
            ans += 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that is less than `n`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers that includes all elements of `a` that were in `todo` except `a[r - m]` if `a[r - m]` is in `done` and `a[r - m]` is not in `extra`, otherwise `todo` is an empty set, `done` is a set of integers that includes all elements of `a` that were in `todo` except `a[r - m]` if `a[r - m]` is in `done` and `a[r - m]` is not in `extra`, otherwise `done` includes all elements of `a` that were in `todo`, `extra` is a set of integers that includes all elements of `a` that were not in `todo` and includes the value of `a[r]` if `a[r]` is not in `todo`, otherwise `extra` does not include the value of `a[r]`. If `old` is in `extra`, then `old` is removed from `extra`. If `old` is in `done`, then `todo` includes `old`, `done` includes all elements of `a` that were in `todo` except `old`, and `extra` includes all elements of `a` that were not in `todo` and includes the value of `a[r]` if `a[r]` is not in `todo`. Otherwise, `todo` is an empty set, `done` includes all elements of `a` that were in `todo`, and `extra` does not include the value of `a[r]`. `_` is 0, `j` is `n-1`, `ans` is `n-m+1` if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is `n-m` if `a[r - m]` is in `done`, otherwise `ans` is `n-m+1` if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is `n-m`, `r` is equal to `n`, `old` is equal to `a[r - m]`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, then `todo`, `done`, and `extra` are updated accordingly. Otherwise, `a[r]` is added to `extra`. If the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is `n-m+1`. Otherwise, `ans` is `n-m` if `a[r - m]` is in `done`, otherwise `ans` is `n-m`. The value of `ans` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer that is greater than `m`, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers, `_` is 1, `j` is `m`, `r` is equal to `n`, `old` is `a[n - m]`. If `a[n - m]` is in `extra`, then `extra` does not include `a[n - m]`. Otherwise, if `a[n - m]` is in `done`, then `todo` includes the value of `a[n - m]`, otherwise `todo` does not include the value of `a[n - m]`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, then `todo` does not include the value of `a[r]` and `done` includes the value of `a[r]`. Otherwise, `extra` includes `a[r]`. If the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is `n - m + 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is `n - m` if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k-1`, otherwise `ans` is `n - m - 1`. If `old` is in `extra`, then `extra` does not include `a[n - m]`. If `old` is in `done`, then `todo` includes the value of `old` and `done` does not include the value of `old`. If `old` is not in `done`, then `todo` does not include the value of `old` and `done` includes the value of `old`, and ans is printed, ans (where ans is n - m + 1 if the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k, otherwise n - m if the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k-1, otherwise n - m - 1)

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The final output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: ans is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
