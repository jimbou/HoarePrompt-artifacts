The only variable in the loop head is variable `j` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `m` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `j` is increased by 1 so `j` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `m` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers, `_` is 0, `j` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs. If `a[j]` is in `todo`, then `a[j]` is removed from `todo` and added to `done`. Otherwise, `a[j]` is added to `extra`**
