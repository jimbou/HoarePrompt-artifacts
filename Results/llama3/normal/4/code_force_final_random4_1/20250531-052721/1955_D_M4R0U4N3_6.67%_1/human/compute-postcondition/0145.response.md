Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, todo is a set of integers containing old, done is a set of integers not containing old, extra is a set of integers not containing old, _ is 2, j is m, r is equal to m, old is a[r - m], ans is 0 if the number of elements in done is less than k, otherwise 1, m is less than n, and old is in todo.**

The code snippet modifies the sets `done` and `todo` by removing `old` from `done` and adding it to `todo`. The value of `old` is still equal to `a[r - m]`, and it is no longer in `done` but is now in `todo`. The value of `ans` is updated based on the new size of `done`, which is now less than or equal to `k - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
