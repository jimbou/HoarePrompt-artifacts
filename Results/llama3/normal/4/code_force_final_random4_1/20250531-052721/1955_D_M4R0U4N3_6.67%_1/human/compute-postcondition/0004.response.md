Output State: **n is an integer, m is greater than 0, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, todo is a set of integers with a[j] removed, done is a set containing a[j], extra is an empty set, _ is 0, j is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line removes the current value of `a[j]` from the set `todo`, effectively reducing the size of `todo` by one. The second line adds the same value to the set `done`, making `done` non-empty and containing the value of `a[j]`. No other variables are affected by the code. The value of `j` remains 0, and the state of `stdin` remains unchanged as it is not accessed or modified by the code.
