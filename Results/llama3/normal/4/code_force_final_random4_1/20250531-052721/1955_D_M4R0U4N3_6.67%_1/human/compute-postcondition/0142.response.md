Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers, `_` is 2, `j` is equal to `m`, `r` is equal to `m`, `old` is not an element of `extra`, `ans` is 1 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise 0, `m` is less than `n`.**

In this output state, the value of `old` is removed from the set `extra`, but the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `m` and `n` is still valid, and the value of `ans` is still dependent on the number of elements in `done` and the value of `k`.
