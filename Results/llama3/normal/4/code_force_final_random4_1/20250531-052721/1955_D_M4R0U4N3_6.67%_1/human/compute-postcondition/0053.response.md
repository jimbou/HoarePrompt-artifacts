Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer that is less than n, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, todo is a set of integers that includes all elements of a that were in todo except a[r - m] if a[r - m] is in done and a[r - m] is not in extra, otherwise todo is an empty set, done is a set of integers that includes all elements of a that were in todo except a[r - m] if a[r - m] is in done and a[r - m] is not in extra, otherwise done includes all elements of a that were in todo, extra is a set of integers that includes all elements of a that were not in todo and includes the value of a[r] if a[r] is not in todo, otherwise extra does not include the value of a[r], _ is 0, j is m, ans is 3 if the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k, otherwise ans is 2 if a[r - m] is in done, otherwise ans is 3 if the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k, otherwise ans is 2, r is equal to m+2, old is equal to a[r - m].**

The code first removes the value of `a[r]` from `todo` and then adds it to `done`. This means that `todo` will no longer include `a[r]`, and `done` will now include `a[r]`. The value of `extra` is not affected by this code, as it only depends on the elements of `a` that were not in `todo` and the value of `a[r]` if it is not in `todo`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `_`, `j`, `ans`, and `old` are not modified by this code. The value of `r` is still equal to `m+2`, and the value of `old` is still equal to `a[r - m]`.
