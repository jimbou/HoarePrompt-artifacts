Output State: **n, m, k, a, j, r+1 are integers. m is less than n. If the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k, then if a[r+1] is in todo, todo does not contain a[r+1], done contains a[r+1], extra does not contain a[r+1], and ans is 2. If a[r+1] is not in todo, then if a[r - m] is in extra, a[r - m] is not an element of extra. If a[r - m] is in done, then todo contains a[r - m], done does not contain a[r - m], extra contains a[r+1], and ans is 2. If a[r - m] is not in done, then todo does not contain a[r - m], done contains a[r - m], extra contains a[r+1], and ans is 2. Additionally, a[r+1] is in extra. If the number of elements in done is less than k, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. If old is in done, then old is not an element of done. old is an element of todo. If the number of elements in done was greater than or equal to k, then ans is 2. If the number of elements in done was less than k, then ans is an integer.**

The code removes a[r] from todo and adds it to done. This means that the number of elements in done has increased by 1. If the number of elements in done was less than k before the code executed, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. If the number of elements in done was greater than or equal to k before the code executed, then the state of the variables changes as follows: if a[r+1] is in todo, then todo does not contain a[r+1], done contains a[r+1], extra does not contain a[r+1], and ans is 2. If a[r+1] is not in todo, then if a[r - m] is in extra, a[r - m] is not an element of extra. If a[r - m] is in done, then todo contains a[r - m], done does not contain a[r - m], extra contains a[r+1], and ans is 2. If a[r - m] is not in done, then todo does not contain a[r - m], done contains a[r - m], extra contains a[r+1], and ans is 2. Additionally, a[r+1] is in extra. If old is in done, then old is not an element of done. old is an element of todo. If the number of elements in done was greater than or equal to k, then ans is 2. If the number of elements in done was less than k, then ans is an integer.
