Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, todo is a set of integers, done is a set of integers, extra is a set of integers, _ is 2, j is m, r is equal to n, old is a[n - m]. If a[n - m] is in extra, then extra does not include a[n - m]. Otherwise, if a[n - m] is in done, then todo includes the value of a[n - m], otherwise todo does not include the value of a[n - m]. If a[r] is in todo, then todo does not include the value of a[r] and done includes the value of a[r]. Otherwise, extra includes a[r]. If the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k, then ans is n - m + 1. Otherwise, ans is n - m if the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k-1, otherwise ans is n - m - 1. If old is in extra, then extra does not include a[n - m]. If old is in done, then todo includes the value of old and done does not include the value of old. If old is not in done, then todo does not include the value of old and done includes the value of old, and ans is printed, ans (where ans is n - m + 1 if the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k, otherwise n - m if the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k-1, otherwise n - m - 1)
Code of the loop:
for j in range(m):
    if a[j] in todo:
        todo.remove(a[j])
        done.add(a[j])
    else:
        extra.add(a[j])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer, m is greater than 0, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, todo is a set of integers, done is a set of integers, extra is a set of integers, _ is 2, j is 0, r is equal to n, old is a[n - m]. If a[n - m] is in extra, then extra does not include a[n - m]. Otherwise, if a[n - m] is in done, then todo includes the value of a[n - m], otherwise todo does not include the value of a[n - m]. If a[r] is in todo, then todo does not include the value of a[r] and done includes the value of a[r]. Otherwise, extra includes a[r]. If the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k, then ans is n - m + 1. Otherwise, ans is n - m if the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k-1, otherwise ans is n - m - 1. If old is in extra, then extra does not include a[n - m]. If old is in done, then todo includes the value of old and done does not include the value of old. If old is not in done, then todo does not include the value of old and done includes the value of old, and ans is printed, ans (where ans is n - m + 1 if the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k, otherwise n - m if the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k-1, otherwise n - m - 1). If a[j] is in todo, then todo does not include the value of a[j] and done includes the value of a[j]. Otherwise, extra includes a[j].

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer, m is greater than 1, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, todo is a set of integers, done is a set of integers, extra is a set of integers, _ is 2, j is 1, r is equal to n, old is a[n - m]. If a[n - m] is in extra, then extra does not include a[n - m]. Otherwise, if a[n - m] is in done, then todo includes the value of a[n - m], otherwise todo does not include the value of a[n - m]. If a[r] is in todo, then todo does not include the value of a[r] and done includes the value of a[r]. Otherwise, extra includes a[r]. If the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k, then ans is n - m + 1. Otherwise, ans is n - m if the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k-1, otherwise ans is n - m - 1. If old is in extra, then extra does not include a[n - m]. If old is in done, then todo includes the value of old and done does not include the value of old. If old is not in done, then todo does not include the value of old and done includes the value of old, and ans is printed, ans (where ans is n - m + 1 if the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k, otherwise n - m if the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k-1, otherwise n - m - 1). If a[j] is in todo, then todo does not include the value of a[j] and done includes the value of a[j]. Otherwise, extra includes a[j].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer, m is greater than 2, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, todo is a set of integers, done is a set of integers, extra is a set of integers, _ is 2, j is 2, r is equal to n, old is a[n - m]. If a[n - m] is in extra, then extra does not include a[n - m]. Otherwise, if a[n - m] is in done, then todo includes the value of a[n - m], otherwise todo does not include the value of a[n - m]. If a[r] is in todo, then todo does not include the value of a[r] and done includes the value of a[r]. Otherwise, extra includes a[r]. If the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k, then ans is n - m + 1. Otherwise, ans is n - m if the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k-1, otherwise ans is n - m - 1. If old is in extra, then extra does not include a[n - m]. If old is in done, then todo includes the value of old and done does not include the value of old. If old is not in done, then todo does not include the value of old and done includes the value of old, and ans is printed, ans (where ans is n - m + 1 if the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k, otherwise n - m if the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k-1, otherwise n - m - 1). If a[j] is in todo, then todo does not include the value of a[j] and done includes the value of a[j]. Otherwise, extra includes a[j].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
