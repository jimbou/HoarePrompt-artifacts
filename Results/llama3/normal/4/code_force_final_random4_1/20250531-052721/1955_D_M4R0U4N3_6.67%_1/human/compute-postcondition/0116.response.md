Output State: **`n` is an integer that is greater than `m+1`, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers, `_` is 1, `j` is `m`, `r` is equal to `m+2`, `old` is `a[r - m]`. If `a[1]` is in `extra`, then `extra` does not include `a[1]`. Otherwise, if `a[1]` is in `done`, then `todo` includes the value of `a[1]`, otherwise `todo` does not include the value of `a[1]`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, then `todo` does not include the value of `a[r]` and `done` includes the value of `a[r]`. Otherwise, `extra` includes `a[r]`. If the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 4. Otherwise, `ans` is 3 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k-1`, otherwise `ans` is 2. If `old` is in `extra`, then `extra` does not include `a[r - m]`. If `old` is in `done`, then `todo` includes the value of `old` and `done` does not include the value of `old`. If `old` is not in `done`, then `todo` does not include the value of `old` and `done` includes the value of `old`.**

The code increments the value of `ans` by 1. The initial value of `ans` depends on the number of elements in `done`. If the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is initially 3. Otherwise, `ans` is initially 2 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k-1`, otherwise `ans` is initially 1. After incrementing `ans` by 1, the new value of `ans` will be 4, 3, or 2, respectively. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
