Postcondition: **n, m, k, j, r+1+1 are integers. m is less than n. old is a[r - m]. If the number of elements in done was greater than or equal to k, then ans is 3. If the number of elements in done was less than k, then ans is an integer incremented by 1. If old is in done, then done does not contain old and old is an element of todo. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
