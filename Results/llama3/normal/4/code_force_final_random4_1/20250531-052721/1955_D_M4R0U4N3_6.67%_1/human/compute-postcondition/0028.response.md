Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer that is less than n, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, todo is a set of integers that includes old if old is in done and old is not in extra, otherwise todo is an empty set, done is a set of integers that includes all elements of a that were in todo except old if old is in done and old is not in extra, otherwise done includes all elements of a that were in todo, extra is a set of integers that includes all elements of a that were not in todo but does not include the value of old if old is in extra, _ is 0, j is m-1, ans is 1 if the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k, otherwise ans is 0, r is equal to m, old is equal to a[m-1], stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, a[r] is not in todo, a[r] is in done.**

The code removes the current value of `a[r]` from the set `todo` and adds it to the set `done`. This means that `a[r]` is no longer in `todo` and is now in `done`. The value of `r` remains equal to `m`, and the value of `old` remains equal to `a[m-1]`. The sets `done` and `extra` are updated accordingly, with `done` including all elements of `a` that were in `todo` except `old` if `old` is in `done` and `old` is not in `extra`, and `extra` including all elements of `a` that were not in `todo` but not including the value of `old` if `old` is in `extra`. The value of `ans` is updated based on the number of elements in `done`, which is now greater than or equal to `k`. The other variables remain unchanged.
