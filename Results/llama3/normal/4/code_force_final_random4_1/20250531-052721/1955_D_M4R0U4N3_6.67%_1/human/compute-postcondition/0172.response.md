Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k`, `j`, `r+1+1` are integers. `m` is less than `n`. If `old` is in `extra`, then `old` is not an element of `extra`. If the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, then if `a[r+1+1]` is in `todo`, `todo` does not contain `a[r+1+1]`, `done` contains `a[r+1+1]`, and `extra` contains `a[r+1+1]` if `a[r+1]` is in `todo`, otherwise `extra` does not contain `a[r+1+1]`. If `a[r+1+1]` is not in `todo`, then if `a[r - m+1]` is in `extra`, `a[r - m+1]` is not an element of `extra`. If `a[r - m+1]` is in `done`, then `todo` contains `a[r - m+1]`, `done` does not contain `a[r - m+1]`, and `extra` contains `a[r+1+1]`. If `a[r - m+1]` is not in `done`, then `todo` does not contain `a[r - m+1]`, `done` contains `a[r - m+1]`, and `extra` contains `a[r+1+1]`. Additionally, `a[r+1+1]` is in `extra`. If `old` is in `done`, then `old` is not an element of `done`. `old` is an element of `todo`. If the number of elements in `done` was greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 3. If the number of elements in `done` was less than `k`, then `ans` is an integer incremented by 1. If the number of elements in `done` is less than `k`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `old` is not in `extra`, then if the number of elements in `done` was greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 3. If the number of elements in `done` was less than `k`, then `ans` is an integer incremented by 1. If `old` is in `done`, then `done` does not contain `old` and `old` is an element of `todo`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
