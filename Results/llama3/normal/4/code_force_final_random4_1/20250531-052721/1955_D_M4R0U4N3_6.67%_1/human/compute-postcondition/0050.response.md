Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer that is less than n, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, todo is a set of integers that includes old, done is a set of integers that includes all elements of a that were in todo except old, extra is a set of integers that includes all elements of a that were not in todo and includes the value of a[r] if a[r] is not in todo, _ is 0, j is m, ans is 3 if the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k, otherwise ans is 2 if old is in done, otherwise ans is 3 if the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k, otherwise ans is 2, r is equal to m+2, old is equal to a[r - m], stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.**

The code modifies the sets `done` and `todo` by removing `old` from `done` and adding it to `todo`. The value of `old` is equal to `a[r - m]`. The number of elements in `done` may change based on whether `old` was in `done` before the code executed. The value of `ans` depends on the number of elements in `done` and whether `old` is in `done`. All other variables remain unchanged.
