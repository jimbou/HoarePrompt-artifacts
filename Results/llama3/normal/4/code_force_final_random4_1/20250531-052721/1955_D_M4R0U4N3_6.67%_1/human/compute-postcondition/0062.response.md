Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer that is less than n, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, todo is a set of integers, done is a set of integers, extra is a set of integers, _ is 1, j is n-1, ans is n-m+1 if the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k, otherwise ans is n-m if a[r - m] is in done, otherwise ans is n-m+1 if the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k, otherwise ans is n-m, r is equal to n, old is equal to a[r - m].**

The code snippet provided assigns new values to the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `todo`, `done`, and `extra` based on the input provided. The values of `j`, `ans`, `r`, and `old` are not modified by the code snippet. The value of `ans` is printed based on the conditions specified in the initial state. The final state includes the updated values of the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `todo`, `done`, and `extra`, as well as the unchanged values of `j`, `ans`, `r`, and `old`.
