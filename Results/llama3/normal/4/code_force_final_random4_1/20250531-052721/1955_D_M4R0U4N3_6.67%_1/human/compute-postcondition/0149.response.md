Output State: **n, m, k, a, extra, _, j, r, and old are integers. todo does not contain a[r], done contains a[r], extra does not contain a[r], and ans is 1 if the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k, otherwise 0. m is less than n.**

The code removes the value of `a[r]` from `todo` and adds it to `done`. This means that `todo` no longer contains `a[r]`, and `done` now contains `a[r]`. The value of `extra` remains unchanged, as it does not contain `a[r]`. The value of `ans` is determined by the number of elements in `done`, which has increased by 1. If the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 1; otherwise, it is 0. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `_`, `j`, `r`, and `old` remain unchanged.
