Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer that is at least 1 and less than n, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, todo is a set of integers with one less element, done is a set of integers with one more element, extra is a set of integers, _ is 1, j is 1, ans is n-m+1 if the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k, otherwise ans is n-m if a[r - m] is in done, otherwise ans is n-m+1 if the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k, otherwise ans is n-m, r is equal to n, old is equal to a[r - m].**

The code snippet modifies the sets `todo` and `done` by removing an element from `todo` and adding it to `done`. The value of `ans` is determined based on the number of elements in `done` and the presence of `a[r - m]` in `done`. The other variables remain unchanged.
