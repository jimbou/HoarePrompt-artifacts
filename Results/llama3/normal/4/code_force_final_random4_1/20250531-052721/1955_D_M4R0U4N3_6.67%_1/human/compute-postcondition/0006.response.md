Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is an empty set, `extra` contains `a[j]`, `_` is 0, `j` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, and `a[j]` is not in `todo`**

In this output state, the value of `extra` has been updated to include `a[j]`, which was not in `todo` initially. The values of the other variables remain the same. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs.
