Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer that is at least 2 and less than n, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, todo is a set of integers with a[j] removed, done is a set of integers with a[j] added, extra is a set of integers, _ is 1, j is 2, ans is n-m+1 if the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k, otherwise ans is n-m if a[r - m] is in done, otherwise ans is n-m+1 if the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k, otherwise ans is n-m, r is equal to n, old is equal to a[r - m].**

The code removes `a[j]` from the `todo` set and adds it to the `done` set. This affects the number of elements in `done` and potentially changes the value of `ans` based on the conditions provided. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
