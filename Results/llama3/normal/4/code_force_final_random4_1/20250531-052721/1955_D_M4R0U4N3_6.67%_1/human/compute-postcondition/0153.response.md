Postcondition: **n, m, k, a, todo, done, extra, _, j, r, old, and ans are integers. m is less than n. The number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k. If a[r] is in todo, then todo does not contain a[r], done contains a[r], extra does not contain a[r], and ans is 1. If a[r] is not in todo, then if old is in extra, old is not an element of extra. If old is in done, then todo contains old, done does not contain old, extra contains a[r], ans is 0 if the number of elements in done is less than k, otherwise 1. If old is not in done, then todo does not contain old, done contains old, extra contains a[r], ans is 1 if the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k, otherwise 0. Additionally, a[r] is in extra.**
