Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers, `_` is 0, `j` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs. If `a[j]` is in `todo`, then `a[j]` is removed from `todo` and added to `done`. Otherwise, `a[j]` is added to `extra`***
