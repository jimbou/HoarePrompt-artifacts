Precondition: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three lines. The first line contains three integers n, m, and k (1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6). The third line contains m integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_m (1 <= b_i <= 10^6).**
