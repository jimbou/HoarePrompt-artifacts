Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, todo is a set of integers, done is an empty set, extra is an empty set, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs**.

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

After executing the code, the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned integer values from the first line of input. The variable `a` is assigned a list of integers from the second line of input. The variable `todo` is assigned a set of integers from the third line of input. The variables `done` and `extra` are initialized as empty sets. The variable `_` remains unchanged with a value of 0. The standard input (`stdin`) now contains multiple test cases minus the three inputs that were consumed by the `input()` function.
