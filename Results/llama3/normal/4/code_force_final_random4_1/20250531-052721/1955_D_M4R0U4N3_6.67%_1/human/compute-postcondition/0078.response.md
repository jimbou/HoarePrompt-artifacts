Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that is less than `n`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers, `_` is 1, `j` is `m`, `ans` is 1 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0, `r` is equal to `n`, `old` is equal to `a[r - m]`. If `a[j]` is in `todo` for all `j` in range(`m`), then `todo` is empty and `done` has all elements from `a[0:m]`. Otherwise, `extra` includes all `a[j]` that are not in `todo`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated based on the condition `len(done) >= k`. If the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 1, otherwise `ans` is 0. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
