Output State: **n is an integer that is greater than m+1, m is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, todo is a set of integers that does not include the value of a[r], done is a set of integers that includes the value of a[r], extra is a set of integers, _ is 1, j is m, r is equal to m+2, old is a[r - m]. If a[1] is in extra, then extra does not include a[1]. Otherwise, if a[1] is in done, then todo includes the value of a[1], otherwise todo does not include the value of a[1]. If a[r] is in todo, then todo does not include the value of a[r] and done includes the value of a[r]. Otherwise, extra includes a[r]. If the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k, then ans is 3. Otherwise, ans is 2 if the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k-1, otherwise ans is 1. If old is in extra, then extra does not include a[r - m]. If old is in done, then todo includes the value of old and done does not include the value of old. If old is not in done, then todo does not include the value of old and done includes the value of old.**

The code snippet modifies the sets `todo` and `done` by removing `a[r]` from `todo` and adding it to `done`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to `a[1]`, `a[r]`, and `old` are still valid, as they are not affected by the code. The value of `ans` is determined based on the number of elements in `done`, which may have changed due to the addition of `a[r]`.
