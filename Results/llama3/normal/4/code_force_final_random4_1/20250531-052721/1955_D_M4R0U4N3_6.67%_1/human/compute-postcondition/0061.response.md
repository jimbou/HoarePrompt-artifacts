The only variable in the loop head is variable `_`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_`. If `_` is less than the input value, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, the input value is unknown but it is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1.
State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that is less than `n`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers that includes all elements of `a` that were in `todo` except `a[r - m]` if `a[r - m]` is in `done` and `a[r - m]` is not in `extra`, otherwise `todo` is an empty set, `done` is a set of integers that includes all elements of `a` that were in `todo` except `a[r - m]` if `a[r - m]` is in `done` and `a[r - m]` is not in `extra`, otherwise `done` includes all elements of `a` that were in `todo`, `extra` is a set of integers that includes all elements of `a` that were not in `todo` and includes the value of `a[r]` if `a[r]` is not in `todo`, otherwise `extra` does not include the value of `a[r]`. If `old` is in `extra`, then `old` is removed from `extra`. If `old` is in `done`, then `todo` includes `old`, `done` includes all elements of `a` that were in `todo` except `old`, and `extra` includes all elements of `a` that were not in `todo` and includes the value of `a[r]` if `a[r]` is not in `todo`. Otherwise, `todo` is an empty set, `done` includes all elements of `a` that were in `todo`, and `extra` does not include the value of `a[r]`. `_` is 1, `j` is `n-1`, `ans` is `n-m+1` if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is `n-m` if `a[r - m]` is in `done`, otherwise `ans` is `n-m+1` if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is `n-m`, `r` is equal to `n`, `old` is equal to `a[r - m]`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, then `todo`, `done`, and `extra` are updated accordingly. Otherwise, `a[r]` is added to `extra`. If the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is `n-m+1`. Otherwise, `ans` is `n-m` if `a[r - m]` is in `done`, otherwise `ans` is `n-m`. The value of `ans` is printed.**
