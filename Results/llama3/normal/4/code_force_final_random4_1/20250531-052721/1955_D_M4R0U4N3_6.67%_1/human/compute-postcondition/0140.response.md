Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers, `_` is 2, `j` is `m`, `r` is equal to `m`, `old` is `a[r - m]`, `ans` is 1 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise 0, `m` is less than `n`**

In this output state, the value of `old` has been updated to `a[r - m]`, which is equivalent to `a[m - m]` since `r` is equal to `m`. Therefore, `old` is now equal to `a[0]`, which is the first element of the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
