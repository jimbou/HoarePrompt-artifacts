Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `todo`, `done`, `extra`, `_`, `j`, `r`, `old` are integers. `m` is less than `n`. The number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, then `todo` does not contain `a[r]`, `done` contains `a[r]`, `extra` does not contain `a[r]`, and `ans` is 2. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, then if `old` is in `extra`, `old` is not an element of `extra`. If `old` is in `done`, then `todo` contains `old`, `done` does not contain `old`, `extra` contains `a[r]`, `ans` is 1 if the number of elements in `done` is less than `k`, otherwise 2. If `old` is not in `done`, then `todo` does not contain `old`, `done` contains `old`, `extra` contains `a[r]`, `ans` is 2 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise 1. Additionally, `a[r]` is in `extra`.**

In natural language, the output state is: All variables remain integers. The relationship between `n` and `m` remains the same. The number of elements in `done` is still greater than or equal to `k`. The value of `ans` has been incremented by 1 in all possible cases. If `a[r]` was in `todo`, it is no longer in `todo`, but is in `done`, and `ans` is now 2. If `a[r]` was not in `todo`, the conditions for `old` being in `extra` or `done` still apply, but `ans` has been incremented by 1 in all cases. Additionally, `a[r]` is now in `extra`.
