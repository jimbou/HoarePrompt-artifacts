Output State: **n is an integer, m is greater than 1, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, todo is a set of integers with a[j] removed, done is a set of integers with a[j] added, extra is a set of integers, _ is 0, j is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs.**

The code snippet modifies the sets `todo` and `done` based on the value of `a[j]`. If `a[j]` is in `todo`, it is removed from `todo` and added to `done`. Otherwise, it is added to `extra`. The other variables remain unchanged.
