Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers that includes `a[j]`, `_` is 0, `j` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `extra` has been updated to include `a[j]`, which was previously not included in `extra`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs.
