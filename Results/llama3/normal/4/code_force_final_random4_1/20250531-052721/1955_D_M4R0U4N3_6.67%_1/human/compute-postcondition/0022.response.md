Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that is less than `n`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is an empty set, `done` is a set of integers that includes all elements of `a` that were in `todo`, `extra` is a set of integers that includes all elements of `a` that were not in `todo`, `_` is 0, `j` is `m-1`, `ans` is 1 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0, `r` is equal to `m`, `old` is equal to `a[m-1]`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, and `old` is not in `extra`***
