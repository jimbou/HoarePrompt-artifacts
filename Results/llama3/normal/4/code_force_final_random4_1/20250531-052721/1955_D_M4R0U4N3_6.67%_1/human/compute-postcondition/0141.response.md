Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set of integers, `extra` is a set of integers, `_` is 2, `j` is equal to `m`, `r` is equal to `m`, `old` is equal to `a[r - m]`, `ans` is 1 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise 0, `m` is less than `n`, and `old` is an element of `extra`.**
