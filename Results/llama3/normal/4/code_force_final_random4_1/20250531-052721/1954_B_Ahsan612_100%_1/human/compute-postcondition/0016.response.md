Output State: **n is an integer at least 1, ar is a list of integers with at least 5 elements if i is 5 or at least 6 elements if i is 6, minn is either positive infinity, 1, 2, or 3, _ is 0, i is either 5 or 6, num is the fourth integer in ar if i is 5 or the fifth integer in ar if i is 6, and same is 1**

In this final state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, making it either 5 or 6. The value of `num` is now the fourth integer in `ar` if `i` is 5 or the fifth integer in `ar` if `i` is 6. The value of `minn` has been updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `same`, which was either 2 or 3. The value of `same` has been reset to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
