Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `same` is 1, `num` is the last integer in `ar`, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, and stdin is empty. If `minn` is either infinity or equal to the length of `ar`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the minimum number of consecutive equal elements in `ar` which is `minn` is printed.***
