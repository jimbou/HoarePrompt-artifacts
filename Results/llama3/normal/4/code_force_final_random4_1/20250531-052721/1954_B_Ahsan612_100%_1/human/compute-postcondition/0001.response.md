Output State: **n is an integer at least 1, ar is a list of integers, same is 1, num is the first integer in ar, minn is positive infinity, i is 1, _ is 0, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `n` is an integer at least 1, which is obtained from the input. The list `ar` contains integers, which are also obtained from the input. The variable `same` is initialized to 1, and `num` is set to the first integer in the list `ar`. The variable `minn` is initialized to positive infinity, and `i` is set to 1. The variable `_` remains unchanged at 0. After the execution of the code, the stdin is empty because all the inputs have been read.
