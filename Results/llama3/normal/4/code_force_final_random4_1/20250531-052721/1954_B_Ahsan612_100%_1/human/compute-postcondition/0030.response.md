To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the loop condition: `i < len(ar)`. This condition depends on the values of `i` and `len(ar)`, which in turn depends on the state of `ar`.

Given the state right before the loop:

- `n` is an integer
- `ar` is a list of integers
- `same` is 1
- `num` is the first integer in `ar`
- `minn` is positive infinity
- `i` is 1
- `stdin` is empty

We need to adjust the states so that the loop can certainly execute at least once. The loop condition `i < len(ar)` must be true for the first iteration.

- `i` is already 1, which is a fixed value.
- `len(ar)` depends on the list `ar`. For the loop to execute at least once, `len(ar)` must be greater than 1 because `i` is 1.

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is the state of `ar`. It must have at least two elements for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `same` is 1, `num` is the first integer in `ar`, `minn` is positive infinity, `i` is 1, and `stdin` is empty.**
