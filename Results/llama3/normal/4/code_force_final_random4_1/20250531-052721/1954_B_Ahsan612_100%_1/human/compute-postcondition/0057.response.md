Output State: **n is an integer, ar is a list of integers, same is 1, num is the first integer in ar, i is 1, minn is infinity, and stdin is empty.**

The code snippet first reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`. Then, it reads a list of integers from stdin and assigns it to `ar`. The variable `same` is set to 1, and `num` is set to the first integer in `ar`. The variable `minn` is set to infinity, and `i` is set to 1. After the execution of the code, stdin is empty because all the inputs have been read.
