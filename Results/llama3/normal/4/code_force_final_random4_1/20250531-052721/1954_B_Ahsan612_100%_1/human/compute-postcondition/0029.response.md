Output State: **n is an integer, ar is a list of integers, same is 1, num is the first integer in ar, minn is positive infinity, i is 1, and stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to a new integer value read from stdin. The list `ar` now contains a new set of integers read from stdin. The variable `same` remains unchanged at 1. The variable `num` now holds the value of the first integer in the updated list `ar`. The variable `minn` has been initialized to positive infinity. The variable `i` has been reset to 1. The variable `_` is no longer mentioned in the output state as its value is not relevant after the code execution. Stdin is empty as all inputs have been read.
