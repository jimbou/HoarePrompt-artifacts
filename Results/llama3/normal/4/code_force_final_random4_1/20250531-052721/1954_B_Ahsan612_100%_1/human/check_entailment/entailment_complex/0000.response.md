Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it not beautiful.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program correctly reads the input from stdin, which includes the number of test cases, the size of each array, and the elements of each array.

2. It initializes variables to keep track of the current number, the count of consecutive occurrences of the current number, and the minimum count seen so far.

3. The program then iterates through the array, updating the count of consecutive occurrences of the current number and the minimum count seen so far.

4. After iterating through the entire array, it checks if the minimum count seen so far is either infinity (which means the array only contains one unique element) or equal to the length of the array (which means the entire array needs to be removed to make it not beautiful). If either condition is true, it prints -1.

5. Otherwise, it prints the minimum count seen so far, which represents the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array not beautiful.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
