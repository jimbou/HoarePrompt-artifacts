Output State: **`n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `same` is either 2 or 3, `num` is either the first or second integer in `ar`, `minn` is either 1 or infinity, and `i` is either 2 or 3, stdin is empty**

The code increments the value of `same` by 1. Initially, `same` was either 1 or 2, so after the increment, it becomes either 2 or 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin is still empty.
