The code `minn = min(minn, same)` updates the value of `minn` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `same`. Since `same` is 1, the value of `minn` will be updated to be the minimum of its current value and 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `same` is 1, `num` is the last integer in `ar`, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, and `minn` is the minimum of its previous value and 1, and stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `minn` is updated to be the smaller of its previous value and 1, while all other variables remain unchanged.
