The code block modifies the values of `i`, `num`, `minn`, and `same`. Here's the combined effect of all lines on the program:

*   `i` is incremented by 1, making it 2.
*   `num` is updated to the second element of `ar`, which is not equal to the first element of `ar`.
*   `minn` is updated to the minimum value between its current value (infinity) and `same` (1), making it 1.
*   `same` is reset to 1.

No other variables are affected by the code block. The final state includes the updated values of `i`, `num`, `minn`, and `same`, along with the unchanged values of `n`, `ar`, and `stdin`.

Output State: **n is an integer, ar is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, same is 1, num is the second integer in ar, i is 2, minn is 1, and stdin is empty.**
