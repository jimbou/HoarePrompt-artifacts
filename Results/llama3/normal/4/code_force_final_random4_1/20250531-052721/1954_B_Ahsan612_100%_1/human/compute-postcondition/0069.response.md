Output State: **`n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `stdin` is empty, `minn` is either 1 or infinity. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is either 2 or 3, and `num` is either the first or second integer in `ar`, and `i` is either 3 or 4. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is the third or fourth integer in `ar`, and `i` is either 4 or 5.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `same`, `num`, and `i` are updated to reflect the new value of `i`.
