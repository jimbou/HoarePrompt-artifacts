The code snippet increments the value of `i` by 1, updates the value of `num` to the second element of `ar`, updates the value of `minn` to the minimum of its current value and `same`, and resets the value of `same` to 1.

Output State: **n is an integer at least 1, ar is a list of integers with at least two elements, same is 1, num is the second integer in ar, minn is 1, i is 2, _ is 0, and stdin is empty.**
