Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 5 elements, `stdin` is empty. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is either 3 or 4, and `num` is either the first or second integer in `ar`, and `i` is either 3 or 4. Otherwise, if `same` is 2, then `num` is the third or fourth integer in `ar`, and `i` is either 4 or 5. If `same` is 1, then `num` is either the fourth or fifth integer in `ar`, and `i` is either 4 or 5, and `minn` is either 1 or the original value of `minn` if it was less than 1.***
