Based on the precondition, the code prints the value of `minn`, which is the minimum of the previous minimum number of consecutive equal elements in the list `ar` and 1.

Since `minn` is neither infinity nor equal to the length of `ar`, it must be a finite integer value. However, the exact value of `minn` cannot be determined without knowing the contents of the list `ar`.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `minn`, which is a finite integer representing the minimum number of consecutive equal elements in the list `ar`.

Output: **minn (where minn is the minimum number of consecutive equal elements in the list ar)**
