Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a "beautiful" array to make it stop being beautiful. A beautiful array is one where all elements can be made the same by replacing an element with its neighboring elements if they are the same.

The program works by iterating through the array and keeping track of the length of the current sequence of identical elements. It updates the minimum length of such a sequence whenever it encounters a new sequence. If the minimum length is equal to the length of the array or infinity (indicating that all elements are the same), it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the minimum length.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful. It handles the edge cases where the array has all identical elements or no elements can be removed to make it stop being beautiful.

Correctness: **True**
