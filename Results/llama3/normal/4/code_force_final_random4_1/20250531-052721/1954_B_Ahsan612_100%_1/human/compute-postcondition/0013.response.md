Output State: **`n` is an integer at least 1, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements if `i` is 3 or at least 4 elements if `i` is 4, `minn` is either positive infinity or 1, and `_` is 0. If `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, `num` is the third integer in `ar` if `i-1` was 2 or the fourth integer in `ar` if `i-1` was 3, `i` is either 4 or 5, and `same` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `ar`, `minn`, and `_` are still valid. The conditions for `same` and `num` are updated based on the new value of `i`.
