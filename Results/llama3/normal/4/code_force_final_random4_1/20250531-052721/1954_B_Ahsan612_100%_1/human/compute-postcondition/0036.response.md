Output State: **`n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `same` is either 1 or 2, `num` is the next element in `ar`, `minn` is 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `stdin` is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. The value of `same` is still dependent on whether the current element in `ar` is equal to the first element, and `num` has been updated to the next element in `ar`. The value of `minn` remains 1, and `stdin` is still empty.
