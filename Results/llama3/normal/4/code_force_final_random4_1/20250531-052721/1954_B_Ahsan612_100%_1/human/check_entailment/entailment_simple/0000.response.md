Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it not beautiful. 

The program first reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the size of the array and the array itself. It then initializes variables to keep track of the count of the same elements and the minimum count. 

The program then iterates over the array, incrementing the count of the same elements if the current element is the same as the previous one, and updating the minimum count and resetting the count of the same elements if the current element is different from the previous one. 

After iterating over the array, the program updates the minimum count one last time and then checks if the minimum count is infinity or equal to the length of the array. If it is, the program prints -1, indicating that it is impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements. Otherwise, the program prints the minimum count, which is the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array not beautiful.

Correctness: **True**
