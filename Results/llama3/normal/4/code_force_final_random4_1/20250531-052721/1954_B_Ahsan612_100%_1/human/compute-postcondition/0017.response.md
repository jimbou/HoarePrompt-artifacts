Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer at least 1, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 5 elements if `i` is 4 or at least 6 elements if `i` is 5, `minn` is either positive infinity or 1, `_` is 0, `i` is either 4 or 5, and `same` is either 3 or 4 if `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`, otherwise `num` is the third integer in `ar` if `i-1` was 2 or the fourth integer in `ar` if `i-1` was 3, and `same` is 2. If `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, then `n` is an integer at least 1, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 5 elements if `i` is 5 or at least 6 elements if `i` is 6, `minn` is either positive infinity, 1, 2, or 3, `_` is 0, `i` is either 5 or 6, `num` is the fourth integer in `ar` if `i` is 5 or the fifth integer in `ar` if `i` is 6, and `same` is 1.***
