Output State: **`n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `same` is 2, `num` is the first integer in `ar`, `minn` is positive infinity, `i` is 1, and `stdin` is empty. The current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.**

The code increments the value of `same` by 1, so its new value is 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `ar` still has at least two elements, and `num` is still the first integer in `ar`. The value of `minn` is still positive infinity, and `i` is still 1. The stdin is still empty.
