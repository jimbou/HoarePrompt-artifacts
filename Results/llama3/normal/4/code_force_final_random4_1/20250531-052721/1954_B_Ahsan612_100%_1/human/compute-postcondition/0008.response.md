Output State: **`n` is an integer at least 1, `ar` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `same` is either 1 or 2, `num` is either the first integer in `ar` or the second integer in `ar`, `minn` is either positive infinity or 1, `i` is either 2 or 3, and `_` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now either 2 or 3, depending on its initial value. The other variables remain unchanged, so their values are still the same as in the initial state.
