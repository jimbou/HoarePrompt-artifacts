Output State: **n is an integer, ar is a list of integers with at least i+1 elements, minn is 1, i is less than len(ar), same is 1, num is the element in ar at index i+1, stdin is empty.**

The code increments `i` by 1, making it one position further in the list `ar`. It then assigns the value of the element at the new index `i` in `ar` to `num`. The value of `minn` is updated to be the minimum between its current value (1) and the value of `same`. Since `same` is either 2, 3, or 1, `minn` will remain 1 because it's already the smallest possible value. Finally, `same` is reset to 1. The values of `n`, `ar`, and `stdin` are not affected by the code.
