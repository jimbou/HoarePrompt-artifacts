Output State: **`n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least `i+1` elements, `minn` is 1, `i` is less than `len(ar)`, `stdin` is empty. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is either 3 or 4. Otherwise, `same` is 2 and `num` is the element in `ar` at index `i+1`.**

In this output state, the value of `same` has been incremented by 1. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is either 3 or 4, because it was either 2 or 3 before the increment. Otherwise, `same` is 2, because it was 1 before the increment, and `num` is still the element in `ar` at index `i+1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
