Output: **`n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `same` is 1, `num` is the last integer in `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of the previous minimum number of consecutive equal elements in `ar` and 1, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, and stdin is empty. The current value of `minn` is either infinity or equal to the length of `ar`, and -1 is being printed**
