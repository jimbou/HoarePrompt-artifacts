Output: **`n` is an integer at least 1, `ar` is a list of integers, `same` is 1, `num` is the last integer in `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of the length of the shortest sequence of equal integers in `ar` and 1, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `_` is 0, and stdin is empty. `minn` is neither infinity nor equal to the length of `ar`, and the minimum of the length of the shortest sequence of equal integers in `ar` and 1 which is equal to minn is being printed**
