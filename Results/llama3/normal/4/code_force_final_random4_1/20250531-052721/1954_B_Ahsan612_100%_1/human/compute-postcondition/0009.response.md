According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `ar`. If `i` is less than `len(ar)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 2 or 3, and `ar` is a list of integers with at least two elements. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than the length of `ar`, so `ar` must have at least 3 elements if `i` is 2 or at least 4 elements if `i` is 3. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer at least 1, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements if `i` is 2 or at least 4 elements if `i` is 3, `same` is either 1 or 2, `num` is either the first integer in `ar` or the second integer in `ar`, `minn` is either positive infinity or 1, `i` is either 2 or 3, and `_` is 0**
