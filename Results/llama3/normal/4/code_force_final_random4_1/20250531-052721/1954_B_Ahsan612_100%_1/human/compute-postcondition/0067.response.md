Output State: **n is an integer, ar is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, stdin is empty, same is 1, num is the third or fourth integer in ar, minn is either 1 or infinity, and i is either 3 or 4**

The code block increments the value of `i` by 1, making it either 3 or 4. Then, it assigns the value of the element at index `i` in list `ar` to `num`, making `num` the third or fourth integer in `ar`. The value of `minn` is updated to be the minimum between its original value (either 1 or infinity) and the value of `same` (either 1 or 2), resulting in `minn` being either 1 or infinity. Finally, the value of `same` is set to 1. The values of `n` and `ar` remain unchanged, and `stdin` remains empty.
