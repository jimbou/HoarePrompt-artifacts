Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `stdin` is empty, `minn` is either 1 or infinity. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is either 2 or 3, and `num` is either the first or second integer in `ar`, and `i` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is the third or fourth integer in `ar`, and `i` is either 3 or 4.***
