Output State: **n is an integer, ar is a list of integers with at least 5 elements, stdin is empty, minn is either 1 or the original value of minn if it was less than 1, same is 1, num is either the fourth or fifth integer in ar, and i is either 4 or 5.**

The code increments the value of `i` by 1, making it either 4 or 5. Then, it assigns the value of the element at the new index `i` in the list `ar` to `num`, making `num` either the fourth or fifth integer in `ar`. The third line updates the value of `minn` to be the minimum between its original value and the value of `same`. Since `same` is either 2 or 3 when `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, and 1 otherwise, `minn` will be either 1 or its original value if it was less than 1. Finally, the last line sets the value of `same` to 1.
