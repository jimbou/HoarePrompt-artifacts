The variable in the loop head is `i` and `ar`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `ar`. If `i` is less than `len(ar)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, `ar` is a list of integers with at least three elements. `i` being incremented by 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is less than `len(ar)`. `ar` being a list of integers with at least three elements does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `ar` is a list of integers with at least `i+1` elements.
State: **`n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least `i+1` elements, `minn` is 1, `i` is less than `len(ar)`, `stdin` is empty. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, `same` is 1 and `num` is the element in `ar` at index `i+1`.**
