Output State: **`n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `same` is 1, `num` is the last integer in `ar`, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, and `minn` is the minimum of its previous value and 1, and stdin is empty. If `minn` is either infinity or equal to the length of `ar`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, `minn` is neither infinite nor equal to the length of `ar`, and the value of `minn` which is 1 is printed.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations and has processed all the test cases provided in the input. The loop has iterated over each test case, processed the list of integers, and determined the minimum length of consecutive equal elements in each list. If the minimum length is either infinity (indicating no consecutive equal elements) or equal to the length of the list (indicating all elements are equal), the loop prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the minimum length of consecutive equal elements, which is 1. The loop has completed its execution, and the input has been fully processed.
