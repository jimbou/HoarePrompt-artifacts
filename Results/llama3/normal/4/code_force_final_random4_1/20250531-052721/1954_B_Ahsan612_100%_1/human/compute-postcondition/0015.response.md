Output State: **`n` is an integer at least 1, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 5 elements if `i` is 4 or at least 6 elements if `i` is 5, `minn` is either positive infinity or 1, `_` is 0, `i` is either 4 or 5, and `same` is either 3 or 4 if `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`, otherwise `num` is the third integer in `ar` if `i-1` was 2 or the fourth integer in `ar` if `i-1` was 3, and `same` is 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `same` has been incremented by 1. If `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is now either 3 or 4. Otherwise, `num` remains the third integer in `ar` if `i-1` was 2 or the fourth integer in `ar` if `i-1` was 3, and `same` is now 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
