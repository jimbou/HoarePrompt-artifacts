Output State: **`n` is an integer at least 1, `ar` is a list of integers, `same` is 1, `num` is the last integer in `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of the length of the shortest sequence of equal integers in `ar` and 1, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `_` is 0, and stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `minn` has been updated to be the minimum of its original value (the length of the shortest sequence of equal integers in `ar`) and 1. This is because the code `minn = min(minn, same)` compares the current value of `minn` with the value of `same` (which is 1) and assigns the smaller value to `minn`. The other variables remain unchanged.
