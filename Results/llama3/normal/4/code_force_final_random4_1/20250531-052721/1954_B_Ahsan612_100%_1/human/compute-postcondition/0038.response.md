Output State: **`n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least three elements, `same` is either 2 or 3, `num` is the next element in `ar`, `minn` is 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `stdin` is empty**

The code increments the value of `same` by 1. Since `same` was either 1 or 2 initially, it is now either 2 or 3. The other variables remain unchanged.
