Output State: **n is an integer at least 1, ar is a list of integers with at least 3 elements if i is 2 or at least 4 elements if i is 3, num is the third integer in ar if i was 2 or the fourth integer in ar if i was 3, minn is either positive infinity or 1, i is either 3 or 4, same is 1, and _ is 0**

The code increments the value of `i` by 1, so `i` becomes either 3 or 4. The value of `num` is updated to the integer at the index `i` in the list `ar`. Since `ar` has at least 3 elements if `i` is 2 or at least 4 elements if `i` is 3, `num` becomes the third integer in `ar` if `i` was 2 or the fourth integer in `ar` if `i` was 3. The value of `minn` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `same`, which is either positive infinity or 1. Finally, the value of `same` is set to 1. The values of `n` and `_` remain unchanged.
