Output State: **`n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `same` is 1, `num` is the last integer in `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of the previous minimum number of consecutive equal elements in `ar` and 1, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, and stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `minn` has been updated to be the minimum of its previous value and 1. This means that if the previous value of `minn` was greater than 1, it has been updated to 1, otherwise, it remains the same. The other variables remain unchanged.
