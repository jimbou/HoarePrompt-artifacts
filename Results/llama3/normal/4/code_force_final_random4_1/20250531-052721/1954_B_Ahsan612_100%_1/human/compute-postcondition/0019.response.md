Output State: **n is an integer at least 1, ar is a list of integers, same is 1, num is the last integer in ar, minn is the length of the shortest sequence of equal integers in ar, i is equal to the length of ar, _ is 0, and stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `n` remains an integer at least 1, the list `ar` remains unchanged, the variable `same` is reset to 1, the variable `num` is updated to the last integer in the list `ar`, the variable `minn` is updated to the length of the shortest sequence of equal integers in `ar`, the variable `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, the variable `_` remains 0, and the standard input `stdin` remains empty.
