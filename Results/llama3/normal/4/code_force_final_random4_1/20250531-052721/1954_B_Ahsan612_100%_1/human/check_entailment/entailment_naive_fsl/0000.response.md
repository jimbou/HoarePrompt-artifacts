Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input array has only two distinct elements, and they are alternating. In this case, the program will return the minimum length of the alternating sequence, but it should return 1, because removing one element will make the array not beautiful.

For example, if the input is:

5
1 2 1 2 1

The program will return 2, but the correct answer is 1.

The problem is that the program is not correctly handling the case when the array has only two distinct elements. It is only checking for the minimum length of the sequence of the same elements, but it is not considering the case when the array has only two distinct elements and they are alternating.

To fix this, the program should also check for the case when the array has only two distinct elements and they are alternating, and return 1 in this case.
