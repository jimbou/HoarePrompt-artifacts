Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer at least 1, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements if `i` is 2 or at least 4 elements if `i` is 3, `minn` is either positive infinity or 1, and `_` is 0. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, `num` is the third integer in `ar` if `i` was 2 or the fourth integer in `ar` if `i` was 3, `i` is either 3 or 4, and `same` is 1.***
