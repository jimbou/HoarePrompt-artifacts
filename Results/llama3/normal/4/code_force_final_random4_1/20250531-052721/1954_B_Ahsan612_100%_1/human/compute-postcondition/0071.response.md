Output State: **`n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 5 elements, `minn` is either 1 or infinity. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is either 3 or 4, and `num` is either the first or second integer in `ar`, and `i` is either 3 or 4. Otherwise, `same` is 2, `num` is the third or fourth integer in `ar`, and `i` is either 4 or 5, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `same` has been incremented by 1. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is now either 3 or 4, and the other variables remain the same. If `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, then `same` is now 2, and the other variables remain the same. The values of `n`, `ar`, `minn`, `num`, and `i` are not affected by the code, and `stdin` remains empty.
