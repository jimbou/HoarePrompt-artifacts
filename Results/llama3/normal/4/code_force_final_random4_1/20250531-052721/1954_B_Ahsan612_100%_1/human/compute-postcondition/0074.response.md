Output State: **`n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 5 elements, `stdin` is empty. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is either 3 or 4, and `num` is either the first or second integer in `ar`, and `i` is either 4 or 5. Otherwise, if `same` is 2, then `num` is the third or fourth integer in `ar`, and `i` is either 5 or 6. If `same` is 1, then `num` is either the fourth or fifth integer in `ar`, and `i` is either 5 or 6, and `minn` is either 1 or the original value of `minn` if it was less than 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `same`, `num`, and `minn` are updated accordingly, taking into account the new value of `i`.
