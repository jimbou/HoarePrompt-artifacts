Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer at least 1, `ar` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `stdin` is empty. If the second element of `ar` is equal to the first element, then `same` is 2, `num` is the first integer in `ar`, `minn` is positive infinity, `i` is 1, and `_` is 0. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is the second integer in `ar`, `minn` is 1, `i` is 2, and `_` is 0.***
