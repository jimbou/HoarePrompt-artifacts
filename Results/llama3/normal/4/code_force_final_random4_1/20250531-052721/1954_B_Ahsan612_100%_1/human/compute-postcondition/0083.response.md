Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `same` is 1, `num` is the last integer in `ar`, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, and `minn` is the minimum of its previous value and 1, and stdin is empty. If `minn` is either infinity or equal to the length of `ar`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, `minn` is neither infinite nor equal to the length of `ar`, and the value of `minn` which is 1 is printed.***
