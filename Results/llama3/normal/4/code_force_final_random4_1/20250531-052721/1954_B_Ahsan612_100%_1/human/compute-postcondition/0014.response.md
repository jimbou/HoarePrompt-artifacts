The variables in the loop head are `i` and `ar`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `ar`. If `i` is less than `len(ar)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 4 or 5, and `ar` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements if `i` is 3 or at least 4 elements if `i` is 4. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`, so `len(ar)` must be at least 5 if `i` is 4 or at least 6 if `i` is 5. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer at least 1, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 5 elements if `i` is 4 or at least 6 elements if `i` is 5, `minn` is either positive infinity or 1, and `_` is 0. If `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, `num` is the third integer in `ar` if `i-1` was 2 or the fourth integer in `ar` if `i-1` was 3, `i` is either 4 or 5, and `same` is 1**
