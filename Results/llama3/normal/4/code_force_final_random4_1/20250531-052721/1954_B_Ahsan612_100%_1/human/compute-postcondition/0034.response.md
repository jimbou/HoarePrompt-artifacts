Output State: **n is an integer, ar is a list of integers with at least two elements, same is 1, num is the integer at index i+1 in ar, minn is 1, i is i+1, stdin is empty, and the element at index i+1 in ar is not equal to the integer at index i in ar**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as an integer. The list `ar` also remains unchanged with at least two elements. The variable `same` is reset to 1. The value of `num` is updated to the integer at index `i+1` in the list `ar`. The variable `minn` is updated to 1, which is the minimum value between its original value (positive infinity) and the value of `same` (1). The variable `i` is incremented by 1. The state of `stdin` remains empty. Additionally, the element at index `i+1` in `ar` is not equal to the integer at index `i` in `ar`, maintaining the condition specified in the initial state.
