To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.

The objects in the loop head are `_` and the result of `int(input())`. Since `stdin` is empty at the end of the previous iteration, we can assume that the input has been consumed.

For the loop to execute again, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than the current value of `_`. Since `_` is 0 at the end of the previous iteration, the result of `int(input())` must be at least 1.

The other variables (`n`, `ar`, `same`, `num`, `i`) are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer at least 1, `ar` is a list of integers, `same` is 1, `num` is the last integer in `ar`, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `_` is 1, and stdin is empty.**
