Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `same` is 1, `num` is the last integer in `ar`, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, and `minn` is the minimum of its previous value and 1, and stdin is empty. The current value of `minn` is either infinity or equal to the length of `ar`.**
