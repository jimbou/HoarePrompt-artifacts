Output State: **n is an integer, ar is a list of integers, same is 1, num is the last integer in ar, minn is the minimum number of consecutive equal elements in ar, i is equal to len(ar), and stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

- `n` remains an integer.
- `ar` remains a list of integers.
- `same` is reset to 1.
- `num` is updated to the last integer in `ar`.
- `minn` is updated to the minimum number of consecutive equal elements in `ar`.
- `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, indicating that the loop has iterated over all elements in `ar`.
- `stdin` remains empty.

This output state reflects the final values of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations, based on the given initial state and the loop's logic.
