Output State: **`n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least `i+1` elements, `minn` is 1, `i` is less than `len(ar)`, `stdin` is empty. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is either 3 or 4. Otherwise, `same` is 2 and `num` is the element in `ar` at index `i+1`, `i` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, but all other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to `ar[i]`, `num`, and `same` are still valid, but now they refer to the new value of `i`.
