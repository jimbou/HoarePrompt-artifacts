Output State: **`n` is an integer at least 1, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements if `i` is 2 or at least 4 elements if `i` is 3, `same` is either 2 or 3, `num` is either the first integer in `ar` or the second integer in `ar`, `minn` is either positive infinity or 1, `i` is either 2 or 3, and `_` is 0**

The value of `same` is incremented by 1, so it can be either 2 or 3. The other variables remain unchanged.
