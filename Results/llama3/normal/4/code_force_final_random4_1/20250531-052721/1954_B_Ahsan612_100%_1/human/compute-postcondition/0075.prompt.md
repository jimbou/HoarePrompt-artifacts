Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, ar is a list of integers, same is 1, num is the first integer in ar, i is 1, minn is infinity, and stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(ar):
    if ar[i] == num:
        same += 1
    else:
        i += 1
        num = ar[i]
        minn = min(minn, same)
        same = 1
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `stdin` is empty. If the second element of `ar` is equal to the first element, then `same` is 2, `num` is the first integer in `ar`, and `minn` is infinity. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is the second integer in `ar`, and `minn` is 1. `i` is either 2 or 3.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `stdin` is empty, `minn` is either 1 or infinity. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is either 2 or 3, and `num` is either the first or second integer in `ar`, and `i` is either 3 or 4. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is the third or fourth integer in `ar`, and `i` is either 4 or 5.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 5 elements, `stdin` is empty. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is either 3 or 4, and `num` is either the first or second integer in `ar`, and `i` is either 4 or 5. Otherwise, if `same` is 2, then `num` is the third or fourth integer in `ar`, and `i` is either 5 or 6. If `same` is 1, then `num` is either the fourth or fifth integer in `ar`, and `i` is either 5 or 6, and `minn` is either 1 or the original value of `minn` if it was less than 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
