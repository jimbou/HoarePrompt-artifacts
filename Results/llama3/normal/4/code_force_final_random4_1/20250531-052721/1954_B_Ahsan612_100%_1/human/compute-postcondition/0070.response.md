To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `ar`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `i < len(ar)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 4 or 5, and `ar` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the state of `ar` to have at least 5 elements, so that `i` (which is either 4 or 5) is still less than the length of `ar`.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 5 elements, `stdin` is empty, `minn` is either 1 or infinity. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is either 2 or 3, and `num` is either the first or second integer in `ar`, and `i` is either 3 or 4. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is the third or fourth integer in `ar`, and `i` is either 4 or 5.**
