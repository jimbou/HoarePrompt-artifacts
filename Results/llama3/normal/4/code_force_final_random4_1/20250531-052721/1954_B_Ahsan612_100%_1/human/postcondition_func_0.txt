This function reads input from stdin, processes a series of test cases, and prints the minimum length of a subarray that contains all unique elements in a given array. For each test case, it reads an integer n followed by a list of n integers, and then finds the minimum length of a subarray with all unique elements. If no such subarray exists or the entire array has unique elements, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the minimum length of the subarray.
