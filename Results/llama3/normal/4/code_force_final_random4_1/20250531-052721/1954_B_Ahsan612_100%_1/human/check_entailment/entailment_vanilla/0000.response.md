Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it not beautiful. The program works by iterating through the array and keeping track of the length of the longest sequence of the same number. This is done by maintaining a variable `same` that increments whenever the current number is the same as the previous one, and resets whenever a different number is encountered. The minimum length of these sequences is stored in the variable `minn`.

The program then checks if the minimum length is equal to infinity (which means the array consists of only one number) or equal to the length of the array (which means the array is already not beautiful). If either of these conditions is true, the program prints -1, indicating that it is impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements. Otherwise, the program prints the minimum length, which is the minimum number of elements that need to be removed.

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem and handles all the edge cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
