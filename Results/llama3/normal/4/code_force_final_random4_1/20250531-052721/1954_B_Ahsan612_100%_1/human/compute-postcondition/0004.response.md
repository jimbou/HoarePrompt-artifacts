Output State: **`n` is an integer at least 1, `ar` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `same` is 2, `num` is the first integer in `ar`, `minn` is positive infinity, `i` is 1, `_` is 0, `stdin` is empty. The current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`**

In this output state, the value of `same` has been incremented by 1, from 1 to 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `ar` still has at least two elements, and `num` is still the first integer in `ar`. The value of `i` is still 1, and the current value of `ar[i]` is still equal to `num`. The values of `n`, `minn`, and `_` are also unchanged.
