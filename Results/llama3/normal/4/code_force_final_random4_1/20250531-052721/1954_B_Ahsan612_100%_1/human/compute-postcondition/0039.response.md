Output State: **n is an integer, ar is a list of integers with at least three elements, same is 1, num is the element in ar at index i+1, minn is 1, i is incremented by 1, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The list `ar` also remains unchanged as it is only accessed and not modified. The variable `same` is reset to 1, regardless of its initial value. The variable `num` is updated to the next element in the list `ar` at index `i+1`, where `i` has been incremented by 1. The variable `minn` is updated to the minimum value between its initial value (1) and the value of `same` (either 1 or 2), which results in `minn` being 1. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, and the state of `stdin` remains empty as it was initially.
