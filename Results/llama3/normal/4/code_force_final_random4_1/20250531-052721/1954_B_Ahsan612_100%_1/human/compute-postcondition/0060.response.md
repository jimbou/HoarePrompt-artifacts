The code increments the value of `same` by 1. The value of `same` was initially 1, so after the increment, `same` becomes 2. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `same` is 2, `num` is the first integer in `ar`, `i` is 1, `minn` is infinity, and `stdin` is empty. The current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `same` is 2, `num` is the first integer in `ar`, `i` is 1, `minn` is infinity, and `stdin` is empty. The current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.**
