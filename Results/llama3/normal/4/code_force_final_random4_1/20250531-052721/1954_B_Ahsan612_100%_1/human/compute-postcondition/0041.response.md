Output State: **`n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least three elements, `minn` is 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `stdin` is empty. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, `same` is 1 and `num` is the element in `ar` at index `i+1`.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, but the values of the other variables remain the same. The condition that `ar` has at least three elements is still valid, and the relationship between `same` and `num` is still dependent on the value of `ar[i]`. The stdin remains empty.
