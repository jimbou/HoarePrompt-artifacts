Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer at least 1, `ar` is a list of integers, `same` is 1, `num` is the last integer in `ar`, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `_` is 0, and stdin is empty. If the minimum of the length of the shortest sequence of equal integers in `ar` and 1 is either infinity or equal to the length of `ar`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the minimum of the length of the shortest sequence of equal integers in `ar` and 1 is printed.***
