Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `stdin` is empty. If the current element in `ar` is equal to the first element, then `same` is 2. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is updated to the next element in `ar`, `minn` is 1, `i` is incremented by 1, and the next element in `ar` is not equal to the current element.***
