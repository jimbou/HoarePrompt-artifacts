Output State: **n is an integer, ar is a list of integers, same is 1, num is the last integer in ar, i is equal to the length of ar, minn is the minimum number of consecutive equal elements in ar, and stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable "same" is reset to 1, the variable "num" is updated to the last integer in the list "ar", the variable "i" is equal to the length of the list "ar", and the variable "minn" is updated to the minimum number of consecutive equal elements in the list "ar". The other variables "n" and "stdin" remain unchanged.
