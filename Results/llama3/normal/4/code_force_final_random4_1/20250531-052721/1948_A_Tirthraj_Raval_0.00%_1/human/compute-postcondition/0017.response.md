The code prints a string formed by concatenating all elements in the `pattern` list. The `pattern` list contains 'A's and 'B's and has a length of `n`, which is an even integer between 2 and 50 inclusive.
Output: **a string of 'A's and 'B's of length n (where n is an even integer between 2 and 50 inclusive)**
