Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `pattern` is an empty list, stdin contains t-3 integers (1 <= n <= 50), and 'YES' is being printed**

In this output state, the code has created a new empty list called `pattern`. The values of the other variables, `t`, `_`, and `n`, remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-3 integers, and 'YES' is still being printed.
