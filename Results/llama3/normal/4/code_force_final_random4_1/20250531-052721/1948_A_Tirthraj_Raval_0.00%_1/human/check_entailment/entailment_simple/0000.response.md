Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of building a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly n special characters. The program takes an integer n as input and checks if it is odd or even. If n is odd, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible to build a string with an odd number of special characters. If n is even, it prints 'YES' and constructs a string of 'A's and 'B's of length n, where each character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

The program uses a loop to generate the pattern of 'A's and 'B's. It appends 'AB'[i % 2] and 'AB'[i % 2 ^ 1] to the pattern list in each iteration, where i ranges from 0 to n // 2 - 1. This ensures that each character in the string is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible inputs as described in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
