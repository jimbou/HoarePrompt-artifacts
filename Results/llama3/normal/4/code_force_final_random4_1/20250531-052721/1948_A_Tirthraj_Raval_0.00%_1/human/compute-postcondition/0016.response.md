Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an even integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, pattern is a list of 'A's and 'B's with a length of n, stdin contains t-1 integers, 'YES' is being printed, i is n // 2 - 1**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `t` is still an integer greater than 0, the variable `_` is still 0, the variable `n` is still an even integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, the variable `pattern` is a list of 'A's and 'B's with a length of `n`, the variable `stdin` still contains `t-1` integers, 'YES' is still being printed, and the variable `i` is `n // 2 - 1`.
