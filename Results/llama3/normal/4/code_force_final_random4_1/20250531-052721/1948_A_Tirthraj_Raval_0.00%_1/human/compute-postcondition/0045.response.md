Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 2, n is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, pattern is a list containing two elements: 'A' and 'B', stdin contains t-5 integers (2 <= n <= 50), 'YES' is being printed, i is 0**

The code snippet appends two elements to the `pattern` list. The first line appends 'A' or 'B' depending on the value of `i % 2`, which is 0 since `i` is 0. Therefore, 'A' is appended to `pattern`. The second line appends 'B' or 'A' depending on the value of `i % 2 ^ 1`, which is 1 since `i` is 0. Therefore, 'B' is appended to `pattern`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
