Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, stdin contains t-5 integers (1 <= n <= 50). If `n` is odd, 'NO' is being printed. If `n` is even, 'YES' is being printed, and a string of 'A's and 'B's of length `n` is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state is that the value of `n` has been updated to the integer input from the user, which is between 1 and 50 inclusive. The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged. The stdin now contains `t-5` integers. The printing conditions for 'NO', 'YES', and the string of 'A's and 'B's remain the same, depending on whether `n` is odd or even.
