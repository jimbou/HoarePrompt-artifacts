The code assigns the value of `int(input())` to `t`, where `input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (1 <= t <= 50) and then t integers (1 <= n <= 50). The first input is assigned to `t`. So stdin now contains t integers (1 <= n <= 50). The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 50), stdin contains t integers (1 <= n <= 50)**
