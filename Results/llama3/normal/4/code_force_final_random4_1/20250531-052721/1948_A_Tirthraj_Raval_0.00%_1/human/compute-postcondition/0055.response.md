Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `_` is `t`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, stdin contains 0 integers (1 <= n <= 50). If `n` is odd, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is even, 'YES' is printed, and a string of 'A's and 'B's of length `n` is printed.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all `t` iterations. The variable `_` has reached the value of `t`, indicating that the loop has completed. The input buffer (`stdin`) is now empty, as all `t` integers have been processed. The output state also reflects the final values of `n` and the printed output, which depend on whether `n` is odd or even.
