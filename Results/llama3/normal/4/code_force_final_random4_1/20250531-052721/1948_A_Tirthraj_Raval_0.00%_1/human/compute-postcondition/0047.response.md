Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 2, n is an integer between 4 and 50 inclusive, pattern is a list containing four elements: 'A', 'B', 'B', 'A', stdin contains t-5 integers, 'YES' is being printed, i is 1**

The code appends two elements to the `pattern` list. The first line appends 'AB'[i % 2], which is 'B' since i is 1. The second line appends 'AB'[i % 2 ^ 1], which is 'A' since i is 1. The values of t, _, n, stdin, and i remain unchanged.
