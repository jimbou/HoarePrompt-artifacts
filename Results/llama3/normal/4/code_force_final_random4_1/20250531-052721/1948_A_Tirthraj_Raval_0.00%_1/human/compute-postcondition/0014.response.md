To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is an even integer between 4 and 50 inclusive.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Since `n` is an even integer, `n // 2` will be an integer. For the loop to execute again, `n // 2` must be greater than 2.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `i` is 2
* `n` is an even integer between 4 and 50 inclusive, and `n // 2` is greater than 2

The other variables `t`, `_`, `pattern`, `stdin`, and the output `'YES'` are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an even integer between 4 and 50 inclusive, `n // 2` is greater than 2, `pattern` is ['A', 'B', 'B', 'A'], `stdin` contains t-1 integers, `i` is 2**
