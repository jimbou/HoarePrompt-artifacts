The code snippet consists of two lines that append elements to the `pattern` list based on the value of `i`. The first line appends either 'A' or 'B' to `pattern` depending on whether `i` is even or odd. The second line appends the opposite character ('B' if `i` is even, 'A' if `i` is odd) to `pattern`.

Since `i` is initially 0, which is even, the first line appends 'A' to `pattern`, and the second line appends 'B' to `pattern`. As a result, `pattern` becomes ['A', 'B'].

No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an even integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, pattern is ['A', 'B'], stdin contains t-1 integers, 'YES' is being printed, i is 0**
