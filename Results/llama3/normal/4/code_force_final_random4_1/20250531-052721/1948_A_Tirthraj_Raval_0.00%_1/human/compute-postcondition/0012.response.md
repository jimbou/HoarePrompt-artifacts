The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n // 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is an even integer between 2 and 50 inclusive. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute again `n // 2` must be greater than 1. Since `n` is an even integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4 for `n // 2` to be greater than 1.
State: **t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an even integer between 4 and 50 inclusive, pattern is ['A', 'B'], stdin contains t-1 integers, 'YES' is being printed, i is 1**
