Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, pattern is ['A', 'B', 'B', 'A'], i is 1, stdin contains t-3 integers (1 <= n <= 50), 'YES' is being printed**

The code appends two elements to the `pattern` list. The first line appends the character at index `i % 2` from the string 'AB', which is 'B' since `i` is 1. The second line appends the character at index `i % 2 ^ 1` from the string 'AB', which is 'A' since `i` is 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
