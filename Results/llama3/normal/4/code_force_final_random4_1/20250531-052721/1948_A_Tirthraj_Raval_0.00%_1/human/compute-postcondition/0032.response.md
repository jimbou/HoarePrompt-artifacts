Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer greater than 2, pattern is ['A', 'B', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'A'], i is 2, stdin contains t-3 integers (1 <= n <= 50), 'YES' is being printed**

The code appends two elements to the `pattern` list. The first line appends 'AB'[i % 2], which is 'B' since i is 2 and 2 % 2 is 0. The second line appends 'AB'[i % 2 ^ 1], which is 'A' since i is 2 and 2 % 2 ^ 1 is 1. No other variables are affected.
