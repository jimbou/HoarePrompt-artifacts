The code prints a string formed by concatenating all elements in the `pattern` list.
Since the exact elements in the `pattern` list are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the string. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the string formed by concatenating all elements in the `pattern` list.
Output: **string formed by concatenating all elements in the pattern list**
