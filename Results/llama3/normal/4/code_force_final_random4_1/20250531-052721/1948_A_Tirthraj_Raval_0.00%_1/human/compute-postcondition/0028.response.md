Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, pattern is ['A', 'B'], i is 0, stdin contains t-3 integers (1 <= n <= 50), 'YES' is being printed**

The code appends two elements to the `pattern` list. The first line appends 'A' if `i` is even (which it is, since `i` is 0) and the second line appends 'B' (since `i % 2 ^ 1` is 1 when `i` is 0). The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `i`, and the contents of stdin remain unchanged. The 'YES' being printed is also unaffected by the code.
