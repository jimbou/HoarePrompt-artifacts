Output State: **`t` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 integers (1 <= n <= 50)**

In this output state, the value of `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, which is obtained from the input. The value of `t` remains an integer greater than 0, and the value of `_` remains 0. The stdin now contains t-1 integers, as one integer has been consumed to assign the value to `n`.
