The code snippet appends two elements to the `pattern` list. The first line appends the character at index `i % 2` from the string `'AB'`. Since `i` is 1, `i % 2` equals 1, and the character at index 1 in `'AB'` is `'B'`. Therefore, `'B'` is appended to `pattern`.

The second line appends the character at index `i % 2 ^ 1` from the string `'AB'`. The expression `i % 2 ^ 1` equals 0, and the character at index 0 in `'AB'` is `'A'`. Therefore, `'A'` is appended to `pattern`.

No other variables are affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an even integer between 4 and 50 inclusive, pattern is ['A', 'B', 'B', 'A'], stdin contains t-1 integers, 'YES' is being printed, i is 1**
