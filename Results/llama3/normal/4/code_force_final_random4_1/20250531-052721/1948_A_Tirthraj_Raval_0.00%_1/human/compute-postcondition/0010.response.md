To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. Since `n` is even and between 1 and 50 inclusive, `n // 2` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be at least 2 (since `n` is even, `n // 2` will be at least 1 if `n` is at least 2). Additionally, we need to set the initial value of `i` to 0.

State: **`t` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an even integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `pattern` is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 integers, and 'YES' is being printed, `i` is 0**
