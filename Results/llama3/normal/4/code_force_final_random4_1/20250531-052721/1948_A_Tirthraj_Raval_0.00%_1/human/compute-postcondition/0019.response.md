Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 integers (1 <= n <= 50). If `n` is an odd number, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is an even number, 'YES' is printed, a string of 'A's and 'B's of length n is printed, and i is n // 2 - 1.***
