The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 2, n is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, pattern is an empty list, stdin contains t-5 integers (1 <= n <= 50), and 'YES' is being printed does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 1 and i is now 0. 
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `pattern` is an empty list, stdin contains t-5 integers (2 <= n <= 50), 'YES' is being printed, i is 0**
