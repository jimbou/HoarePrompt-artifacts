The function reads a series of integers from standard input, where the first integer represents the number of test cases (t) and each subsequent integer represents the size of a pattern (n). For each pattern size, if the size is odd, the function prints 'NO'. If the size is even, the function prints 'YES' followed by a string of alternating 'A's and 'B's of the specified length. The function processes all test cases and then terminates, leaving the standard input empty.
