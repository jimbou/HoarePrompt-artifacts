The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n // 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 4 and 50 inclusive. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 4.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 4, `pattern` is a list containing four elements: 'A', 'B', 'B', 'A', `stdin` contains `t-5` integers, 'YES' is being printed, `i` is 2**
