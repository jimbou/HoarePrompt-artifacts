Output State: **`t` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `pattern` is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 integers (1 <= n <= 50), and n is even, and 'YES' is being printed**.

In this output state, the code has introduced a new variable `pattern` which is an empty list. The other variables and conditions from the initial state remain unchanged. The value of `t` is still greater than 0, `_` is still 0, `n` is still an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive and even, and 'YES' is still being printed. The stdin still contains t-1 integers.
