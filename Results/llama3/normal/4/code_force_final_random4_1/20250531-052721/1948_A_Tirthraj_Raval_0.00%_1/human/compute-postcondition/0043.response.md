Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `pattern` is an empty list, stdin contains t-5 integers (1 <= n <= 50), and 'YES' is being printed**

In this output state, the code has created a new variable `pattern` and assigned it an empty list. The values of the other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`) remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-5 integers, and 'YES' is still being printed.
