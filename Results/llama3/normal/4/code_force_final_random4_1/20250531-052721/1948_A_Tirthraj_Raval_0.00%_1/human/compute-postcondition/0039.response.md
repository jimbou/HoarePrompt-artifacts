Based on the precondition, the value of `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, and the code checks if `n` is odd or even. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO'. Since the code snippet only contains a single print statement `print('NO')`, regardless of the value of `n`, it will always print 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
