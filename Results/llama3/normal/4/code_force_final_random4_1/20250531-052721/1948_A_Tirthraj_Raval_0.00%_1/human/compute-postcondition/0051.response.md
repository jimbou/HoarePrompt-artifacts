Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 2, n is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, pattern is a list containing n elements, stdin contains t-5 integers (1 <= n <= 50), 'YES' is being printed, i is n // 2 - 1**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `t` remains unchanged, the value of `_` remains unchanged, the value of `n` remains unchanged, the value of `pattern` is a list containing `n` elements, the value of `stdin` remains unchanged, the value of 'YES' remains unchanged, and the value of `i` is `n // 2 - 1`.
