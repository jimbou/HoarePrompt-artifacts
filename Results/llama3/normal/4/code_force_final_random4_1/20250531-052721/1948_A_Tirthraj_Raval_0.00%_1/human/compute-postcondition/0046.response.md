To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, we can say that `n` must be greater than or equal to 4 for the loop to execute again (since `n // 2` must be greater than 1).

The other variables `t`, `_`, `pattern`, `stdin`, and the printed output `'YES'` are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 4 and 50 inclusive, `pattern` is a list containing two elements: 'A' and 'B', `stdin` contains `t-5` integers, 'YES' is being printed, `i` is 1**
