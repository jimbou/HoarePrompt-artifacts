To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n // 2` is at least 1, meaning `n` must be at least 2.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `pattern` is an empty list, stdin contains t-3 integers (1 <= n <= 50), 'YES' is being printed, `i` is 0**
