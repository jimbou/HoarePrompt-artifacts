#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are binary strings, i and j are non-negative integers such that 0 <= i < len(a) and 0 <= j < len(b).
    index = b[j:].find(a[i])
    if (index != -1) :
        return j + index
        #The program returns the sum of j and the index of the first occurrence of a[i:] in b[j:], where j is a non-negative integer less than the length of binary string b, and the index is the position of the first occurrence of a[i:] in b[j:], which is not equal to -1, indicating that a[i:] is found in b[j:].
    else :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1, indicating that `a[i:]` is not found in `b[j:]`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function searches for the first occurrence of a substring `a[i:]` within another binary string `b` starting from index `j`. If found, it returns the index of the first occurrence; otherwise, it returns -1, indicating that the substring is not found.
