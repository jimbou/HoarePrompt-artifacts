Output State: **`a` and `b` are binary strings, `i` and `j` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `i` < len(`a`) and 0 <= `j` < len(`b`), `index` is the index of the first occurrence of `a[i:]` in `b[j:]` or -1 if not found.**

In this output state, the values of `a`, `b`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The new variable `index` is assigned the result of the `find` method, which returns the index of the first occurrence of `a[i:]` in `b[j:]`. If `a[i:]` is not found in `b[j:]`, `index` is assigned -1.
