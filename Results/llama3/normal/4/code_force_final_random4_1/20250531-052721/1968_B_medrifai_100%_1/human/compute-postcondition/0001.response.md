Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are binary strings, `i` and `j` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `i` < len(`a`) and 0 <= `j` < len(`b`). The current value of `index` is the index of the first occurrence of `a[i:]` in `b[j:]` and is not equal to -1, indicating that `a[i:]` is found in `b[j:]`.**
