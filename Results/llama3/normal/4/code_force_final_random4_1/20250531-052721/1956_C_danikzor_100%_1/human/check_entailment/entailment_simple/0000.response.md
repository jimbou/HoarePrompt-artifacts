Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of all numbers in an n x n matrix by performing a series of operations. The operations involve assigning a permutation of integers from 1 to n to a row or column of the matrix.

The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n` and calculates the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix using the formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`. This formula is derived from the fact that the sum of the squares of the first n positive integers is `n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1) / 6`, and the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix is achieved when the numbers are arranged in a specific pattern.

The program then prints the maximum sum and the number of operations required to achieve it, which is `2 * n`. It then prints the operations required to achieve the maximum sum. For each operation, it prints the type of operation (1 for row operation or 2 for column operation), the row or column index, and the permutation of integers from 1 to n.

The program uses a simple and efficient approach to solve the problem. It correctly calculates the maximum sum and the number of operations required to achieve it. The operations printed by the program are also correct and achieve the maximum sum.

Correctness: **True**
