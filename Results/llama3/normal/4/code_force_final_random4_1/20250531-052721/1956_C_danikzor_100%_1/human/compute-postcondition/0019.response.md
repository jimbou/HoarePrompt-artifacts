Functionality: **The function reads an integer n from standard input, representing the size of a matrix, and prints the sum of the squares of the first n positive integers and 2n. It then prints 2n lines, each containing the numbers from 1 to n and from n down to 1 in reverse order, with the first two numbers being 1 and 2, respectively. The function leaves the state of the program with n being an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive) and standard input containing multiple test cases (t-n test cases remaining).**
