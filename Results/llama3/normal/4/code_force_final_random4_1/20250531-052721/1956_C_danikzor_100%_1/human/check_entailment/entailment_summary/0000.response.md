Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and provides a solution with no more than 2n operations.

The program first calculates the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix using the formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`, which is the sum of the squares of the first n positive integers.

Then, it prints 2n lines, each containing the numbers from 1 to n and from n down to 1 in reverse order, with the first two numbers being 1 and 2, respectively. This represents the operations to be performed on the matrix.

The operations are of two types: Type 1 operation, where a row is assigned a permutation of numbers from 1 to n, and Type 2 operation, where a column is assigned a permutation of numbers from 1 to n.

The program correctly alternates between Type 1 and Type 2 operations, assigning the numbers from 1 to n and from n down to 1 in reverse order to each row and column. This ensures that the sum of the numbers in the matrix is maximized.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
