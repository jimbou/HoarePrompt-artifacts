The `print` statement will print the numbers 2, the value of `i` which is 3, and the numbers from `n` down to 1 in reverse order.

Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), the numbers from `n` down to 1 in reverse order will be a sequence of numbers starting from `n` and decreasing by 1 until reaching 1.

Output: **2, 3, and the numbers from n down to 1 in reverse order (where n is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive)**
