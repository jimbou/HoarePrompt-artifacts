Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The problem description requires the program to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix, but the program does not guarantee this. 

For example, when n = 3, the program will output:

```
21 6
1 1 3 2 1
2 1 3 2 1
1 2 2 3 1
2 2 2 3 1
1 3 1 3 2
2 3 1 3 2
```

However, this is not the optimal solution. A better solution would be to fill the matrix with the numbers 1 to 9 in a way that maximizes the sum, such as:

```
8 7 6
5 4 3
2 1 9
```

This solution has a sum of 45, which is greater than the sum of 21 produced by the program. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
