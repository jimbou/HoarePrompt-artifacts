The code prints the number 1, the value of `i` which is 2, and the numbers from `n` down to 1 in reverse order.
Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), the numbers from `n` down to 1 in reverse order will be printed.
Output: **1, 2, and the numbers from n down to 1 in reverse order (where n is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive)**
