The `print` statement will output two values: the result of the expression `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` and the result of the expression `2 * n`.

The first expression is a formula for calculating the sum of the squares of the first `n` positive integers. This formula is derived from the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.

The second expression simply multiplies `n` by 2.

Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), the output will be two integers.

Output: **the sum of the squares of the first n positive integers, 2n (where n is an integer between 1 and 500)**
