The `print` statement will print the numbers 2, 1, and the numbers from `n` down to 1 in reverse order.

Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), the numbers from `n` down to 1 in reverse order will be a sequence of decreasing integers starting from `n` and ending at 1.

The `*` operator in the `print` statement is used to unpack the `range` object, which generates a sequence of numbers from `n` down to 1 in reverse order.

Therefore, the output will be a sequence of numbers starting with 2, followed by 1, and then the numbers from `n` down to 1 in reverse order.

Output: **2, 1, n, n-1, n-2, ..., 2, 1**
