The code prints the numbers 2 and the value of `i` which is 2, followed by the numbers from `n` down to 1 in reverse order. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), the exact sequence of numbers from `n` down to 1 in reverse order cannot be determined without knowing the exact value of `n`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the numbers 2, 2, and the numbers from `n` down to 1 in reverse order.
Output: **2, 2, and the numbers from n down to 1 in reverse order (where n is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive)**
