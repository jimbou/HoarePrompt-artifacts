The code `n = int(input())` accepts an input and converts it to an integer, which is then assigned to the variable `n`. The stdin contains multiple test cases, and the first line contains the number of test cases `t` (1 <= t <= 500). Each test case contains a single integer `n` (1 <= n <= 500) â€” the size of the matrix `a`.

Since the code only reads the first line of the stdin, which contains the number of test cases `t`, the value of `n` will be equal to `t`. The remaining test cases in the stdin will not be affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases (t-1 test cases remaining)**
