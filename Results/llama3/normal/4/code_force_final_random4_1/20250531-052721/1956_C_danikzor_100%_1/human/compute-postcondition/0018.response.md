Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases (t-n test cases remaining), `i` is `n`, and this is printed: "2, `n`, and the numbers from `n` down to 1 in reverse order"**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `i` has reached the value of `n`, and the loop has printed the numbers from `n` down to 1 in reverse order, along with the value 2 and the current value of `i` (which is `n`). The state of the other variables, such as `n` and the number of test cases remaining, remains unchanged.
