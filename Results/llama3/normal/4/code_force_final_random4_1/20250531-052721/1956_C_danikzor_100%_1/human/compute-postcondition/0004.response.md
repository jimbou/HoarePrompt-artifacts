The code prints the number 1, the value of `i` which is 1, and the numbers from `n` down to 1 in reverse order.
Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), the output will be a sequence of numbers starting from 1, followed by the value of `i` which is 1, and then the numbers from `n` down to 1 in reverse order.
Output: **1, 1, [n], [n-1], [n-2], ..., 2, 1 (where n is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive)**
