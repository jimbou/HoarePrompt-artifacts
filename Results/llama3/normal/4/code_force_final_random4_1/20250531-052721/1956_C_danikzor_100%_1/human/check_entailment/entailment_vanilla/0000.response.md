Reasoning:

The problem asks to maximize the sum of all numbers in an n x n matrix by performing two types of operations: assigning a permutation to a row or a column. The goal is to find a solution with no more than 2n operations.

The given program first reads the number of test cases t. Then, for each test case, it reads the size of the matrix n and prints the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and the number of operations in the solution.

The maximum sum is calculated using the formula n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, which is the sum of all numbers from 1 to n^2. This is because the optimal solution is to fill the matrix with numbers from 1 to n^2 in a way that maximizes the sum.

The program then prints the operations to achieve this maximum sum. For each row and column, it assigns a permutation of numbers from n to 1. This is done in 2n operations, which is within the allowed limit.

The program's logic is correct, and it produces the optimal solution for the problem.

Correctness: **True**
