Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n` and calculates the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix using the formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`. This formula is correct because it represents the sum of the squares of the first `n` positive integers.
3. The program then prints the maximum sum and the number of operations, which is `2 * n`.
4. The program then prints `2 * n` lines, each containing the numbers from 1 to `n` and from `n` down to 1 in reverse order, with the first two numbers being 1 and 2, respectively. This is a valid permutation of the numbers from 1 to `n`, and it satisfies the conditions of the problem.
5. The program leaves the state of the program with `n` being an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive) and standard input containing multiple test cases (t-n test cases remaining).

Therefore, the program is correct and produces the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
