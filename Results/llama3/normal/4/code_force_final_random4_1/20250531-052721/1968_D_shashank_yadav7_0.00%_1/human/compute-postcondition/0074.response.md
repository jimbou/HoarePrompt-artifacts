The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`, `t` is a positive integer greater than `n + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is `n + 1`, and `t` must be greater than `n + 1`.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than `n + 1`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers. The current value of `s` is the integer at index `s` in list `p` minus 1, the current value of `b` is the integer at index `b` in list `p` minus 1, the current value of `i` is `n + 1`, and the current value of `k` is decreased by `n`. `sp` is the integer at index `s` in list `a` plus the integer at index `s` in list `a` times `k` plus the integer at index `s` in list `a`, `bp` is the integer at index `b` in list `a` plus the integer at index `b` in list `a` times `k` plus the integer at index `b` in list `a`, `bm` is the integer at index `b` in list `a` times `(k-1)` plus the maximum of the integer at index `b` in list `a` times `(k-1)` and the integer at index `b` in list `a` times `k` plus the integer at index `b` in list `a` plus the integer at index `b` in list `a`, `sm` is the integer at index `s` in list `a` times `(k-1)` plus the maximum of the integer at index `s` in list `a` times `(k-1)` and the integer at index `s` in list `a` times `k` plus the integer at index `s` in list `a` plus the integer at index `s` in list `a`. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, 'Bodya' is printed. If `bm` is less than `sm`, 'Sasha' is printed. Otherwise, 'Draw' is printed.**
