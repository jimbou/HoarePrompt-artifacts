Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than n + 1, i is n + 1, n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, sp is the integer at index s in list a, bp is the integer at index b in list a, bm is the integer at index b in list a times k, sm is the integer at index s in list a times k, s is an integer less than the length of list a, b is an integer less than the length of list a, k is an integer.**

The code first reads four integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s`. Then it reads two lists of integers from the input and assigns them to `p` and `a`. The values of `b` and `s` are decremented by 1. The code then assigns the integer at index `s` in list `a` to `sp`, the integer at index `b` in list `a` to `bp`, the integer at index `b` in list `a` times `k` to `bm`, and the integer at index `s` in list `a` times `k` to `sm`. The values of `t` and `i` are not modified by the code, so they remain the same as in the initial state.
