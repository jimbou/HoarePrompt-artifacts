Functionality: **This function simulates a game between two players, Bodya and Sasha, based on the input provided. It accepts multiple test cases, each containing four integers (n, k, P_B, P_S) and two lists of n integers (p_1, ..., p_n) and (a_1, ..., a_n). The function then determines the winner of the game by calculating the scores of Bodya and Sasha based on the given rules and prints the result as either 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw'.**
