Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than n + 1, i is n + 1, n is an integer greater than 0, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, sp is the integer at index s in list a, bp is the integer at index b in list a, bm is the integer at index b in list a times (k-1), sm is the integer at index s in list a times (k-1), s is an integer less than the length of list a, b is an integer less than the length of list a, k is an integer decreased by 1, i is 0**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of k has been decreased by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The values of bm and sm have been updated to reflect the new value of k.
