Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 0, n is an integer greater than 0, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, sp is the integer at index s in list a plus the integer at index s in list a, bp is the integer at index b in list a plus the integer at index b in list a, b is the integer at index b in list p minus 1, s is the integer at index s in list p minus 1, bm is the integer at index b in list a multiplied by (k-1) plus the maximum of the integer at index b in list a multiplied by (k-1) and the integer at index b in list a multiplied by k plus the integer at index b in list a, sm is the integer at index s in list a multiplied by k plus the maximum of the integer at index s in list a multiplied by k and the integer at index s in list a multiplied by k plus the integer at index s in list a.**

In this final state, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and the list `p` and `a` remain unchanged. The value of `sp` is incremented by the integer at index `s` in list `a`, and the value of `bp` is incremented by the integer at index `b` in list `a`. The value of `b` is updated to be the integer at index `b` in list `p` minus 1, and the value of `s` is updated to be the integer at index `s` in list `p` minus 1. The value of `bm` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and the integer at index `b` in list `a` multiplied by `k` plus the integer at index `b` in list `a`, and the value of `sm` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and the integer at index `s` in list `a` multiplied by `k` plus the integer at index `s` in list `a`.
