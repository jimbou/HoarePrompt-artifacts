Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than n + 1, n is an integer greater than 1, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, sp is the integer at index s in list a plus the integer at index s in list a times (k-1), bp is the integer at index b in list a plus the integer at index b in list a times (k-1), bm is the integer at index b in list a times (k-2) plus the maximum of the integer at index b in list a times (k-2) and the integer at index b in list a times (k-1) plus the integer at index b in list a, sm is the integer at index s in list a times (k-2) plus the maximum of the integer at index s in list a times (k-2) and the integer at index s in list a times (k-1) plus the integer at index s in list a, s is the integer at index s in list p minus 1, b is the integer at index b in list p minus 1, i is 1, and k is decreased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of k is decreased by 1, and the values of sp, bp, bm, and sm are updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged.
