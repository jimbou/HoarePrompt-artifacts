The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **t is a positive integer greater than n + 1, n is an integer greater than 1, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, s is the integer at index s in list p minus 1, b is the integer at index b in list p minus 1, i is 1, k is decreased by n + 1, sp is the integer at index s in list a plus the integer at index s in list a, bp is the integer at index b in list a plus the integer at index b in list a, bm is the integer at index b in list a times (k + 1) plus the maximum of the integer at index b in list a times (k + 1) and the integer at index b in list a times k plus the integer at index b in list a, sm is the integer at index s in list a times (k + 1) plus the maximum of the integer at index s in list a times (k + 1) and the integer at index s in list a times k plus the integer at index s in list a**
