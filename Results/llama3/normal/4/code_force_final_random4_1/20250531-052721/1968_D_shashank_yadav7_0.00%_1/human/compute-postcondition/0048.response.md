Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than n + 1, n is an integer greater than 0, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, sp is the integer at index s in list a, bp is the integer at index b in list a, bm is the integer at index b in list a times (k-1), sm is the integer at index s in list a times (k-1), s is an integer less than the length of list a, b is an integer less than the length of list a, k is 0, and i is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all the variables maintain their initial values, but the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.
