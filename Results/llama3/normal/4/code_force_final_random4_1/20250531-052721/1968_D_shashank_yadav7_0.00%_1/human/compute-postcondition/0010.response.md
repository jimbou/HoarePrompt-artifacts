Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 1, n is an integer greater than 1, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, sp is the integer at index s in list a plus the integer at index s in list a, bp is the integer at index b in list a plus the integer at index b in list a, b is the integer at index b in list p minus 1, s is the integer at index s in list p minus 1, bm is the integer at index b in list a multiplied by (k-2) plus the maximum of the integer at index b in list a multiplied by (k-2) and the integer at index b in list a multiplied by (k-1) plus the integer at index b in list a, sm is the integer at index s in list a multiplied by (k-1) plus the maximum of the integer at index s in list a multiplied by (k-1) and the integer at index s in list a multiplied by (k-1) plus the integer at index s in list a, k is one less than its previous value.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state except that the value of k has been decremented by 1. The values of t, i, n, p, a, sp, bp, b, and s remain unchanged. The values of bm and sm have been updated to reflect the new value of k.
