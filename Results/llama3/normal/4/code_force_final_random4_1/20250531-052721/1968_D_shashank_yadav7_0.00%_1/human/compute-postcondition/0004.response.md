Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 0, n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer minus 1, b is an integer minus 1, s is an integer minus 1, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, sp is the integer at index s in list a, bp is the integer at index b in list a, bm is the integer at index b in list a multiplied by (k-1), sm is the integer at index s in list a multiplied by k, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of k has been decremented by 1, which affects the value of bm. The value of bm is now the integer at index b in list a multiplied by (k-1), since k has been decremented. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
