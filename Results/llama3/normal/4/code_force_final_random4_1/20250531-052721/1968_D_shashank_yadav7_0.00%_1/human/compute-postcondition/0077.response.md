Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than n + 1, n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, s is the integer at index s in list p minus 1, b is the integer at index b in list p minus 1, i is 0, k is decreased by n + 1, sp is the integer at index s in list a, bp is the integer at index b in list a, bm is the integer at index b in list a times (k + 1), sm is the integer at index s in list a times (k + 1)**

In this output state, the value of k has been decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of k is now decreased by n + 1, and the values of bm and sm are updated accordingly, as they are dependent on the value of k.
