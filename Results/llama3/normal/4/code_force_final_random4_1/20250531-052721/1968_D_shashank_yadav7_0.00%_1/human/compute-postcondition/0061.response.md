Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than n + 1, n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, sp is the integer at index s in list a plus the integer at index s in list a times k plus the integer at index s in list a, bp is the integer at index b in list a plus the integer at index b in list a times k plus the integer at index b in list a, bm is the integer at index b in list a times (k-1) plus the maximum of the integer at index b in list a times (k-1) and the integer at index b in list a times k plus the integer at index b in list a plus the integer at index b in list a, sm is the integer at index s in list a times (k-1) plus the maximum of the integer at index s in list a times (k-1) and the integer at index s in list a times k plus the integer at index s in list a plus the integer at index s in list a, s is the integer at index s in list p minus 1, b is the integer at index b in list p minus 1, i is n, and k is decreased by n.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the values of the variables in the loop head and body have been updated accordingly. The loop has iterated n times, and the values of i and k have been updated to reflect this. The values of s, b, sp, bp, bm, and sm have also been updated based on the operations performed in the loop body. The state of the other variables in the precondition, such as t, n, p, and a, remains unchanged.
