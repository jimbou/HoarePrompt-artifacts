Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than n + 1, n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers. The current value of s is the integer at index s in list p minus 1, the current value of b is the integer at index b in list p minus 1, the current value of i is n, and the current value of k is decreased by n. sp is the integer at index s in list a plus the integer at index s in list a times k plus the integer at index s in list a, bp is the integer at index b in list a plus the integer at index b in list a times k plus the integer at index b in list a, bm is the integer at index b in list a times (k-1) plus the maximum of the integer at index b in list a times (k-1) and the integer at index b in list a times k plus the integer at index b in list a plus the integer at index b in list a, sm is the integer at index s in list a times (k-1) plus the maximum of the integer at index s in list a times (k-1) and the integer at index s in list a times k plus the integer at index s in list a plus the integer at index s in list a. The current value of bm is greater than the current value of sm.***
