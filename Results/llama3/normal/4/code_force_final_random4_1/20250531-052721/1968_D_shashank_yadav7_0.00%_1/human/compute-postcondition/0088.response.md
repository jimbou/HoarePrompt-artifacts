Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than n + 1, n is an integer greater than 1, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, s is the integer at index s in list p minus 1, b is the integer at index b in list p minus 1, i is 2, k is decreased by n + 3, sp is the integer at index s in list a plus the integer at index s in list a plus the integer at index s in list a, bp is the integer at index b in list a plus the integer at index b in list a plus the integer at index b in list a, bm is the integer at index b in list a times (k + 3) plus the maximum of the integer at index b in list a times (k + 3) and the integer at index b in list a times (k + 2) plus the integer at index b in list a, sm is the integer at index s in list a times (k + 3) plus the maximum of the integer at index s in list a times (k + 3) and the integer at index s in list a times (k + 2) plus the integer at index s in list a**

In this output state, the value of k has been decreased by 1, and the values of bm and sm have been updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged.
