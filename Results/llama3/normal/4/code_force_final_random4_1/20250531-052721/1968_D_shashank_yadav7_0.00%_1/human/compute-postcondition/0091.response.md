Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than n + 1, n is an integer greater than 1, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, s is the integer at index s in list p minus 1, b is the integer at index b in list p minus 1, i is 2, k is decreased by n + 3, sp is the integer at index s in list a plus the integer at index s in list a plus the integer at index s in list a plus the integer at index s in list a, bp is the integer at index b in list a plus the integer at index b in list a plus the integer at index b in list a plus the integer at index b in list a, bm is the integer at index b in list a times (k + 3) plus the maximum of the integer at index b in list a times (k + 3) and the integer at index b in list a times (k + 2) plus the integer at index b in list a, sm is the integer at index s in list a times (k + 3) plus the maximum of the integer at index s in list a times (k + 3) and the integer at index s in list a times (k + 2) plus the integer at index s in list a.**

In this output state, the values of t, n, p, a, i, and k remain unchanged. The values of s and b are updated to be the integer at index s in list p minus 1 and the integer at index b in list p minus 1, respectively. The values of sp and bp are incremented by the integer at index s in list a and the integer at index b in list a, respectively. The values of bm and sm are updated to be the maximum of their previous values and the integer at index b in list a times k plus bp and the integer at index s in list a times k plus sp, respectively.
