Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than n + 1, n is an integer greater than 1, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, sp is the integer at index s in list a plus the integer at index s in list a times k, bp is the integer at index b in list a plus the integer at index b in list a times k, bm is the integer at index b in list a times (k-1) plus the maximum of the integer at index b in list a times (k-1) and the integer at index b in list a times k plus the integer at index b in list a, sm is the integer at index s in list a times (k-1) plus the maximum of the integer at index s in list a times (k-1) and the integer at index s in list a times k plus the integer at index s in list a, s is the integer at index s in list p minus 1, b is the integer at index b in list p minus 1, i is 1, and k is decreased by 1.**

The code updates the values of `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, and `bp` based on the previous values of `p`, `a`, `k`, and the indices `s` and `b`. The value of `t`, `n`, `p`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `k` is decreased by 1.
