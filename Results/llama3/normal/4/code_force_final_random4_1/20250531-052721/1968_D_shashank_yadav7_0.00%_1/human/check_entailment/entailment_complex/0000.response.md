Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The main issue with the program is that it does not correctly calculate the scores of Bodya and Sasha. The program tries to calculate the maximum score that can be achieved by staying at the same position or moving to the next position, but it does not consider the actual moves made by the players.

In the given program, the scores of Bodya and Sasha are calculated as follows:

bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)

This calculation is incorrect because it assumes that the players will always move to the next position, which is not necessarily true. The players can choose to stay at the same position, and the program does not account for this possibility.

To correctly calculate the scores, the program should keep track of the actual moves made by the players and update their scores accordingly. The program should also consider the case where the players choose to stay at the same position.

Correctness: **False**
