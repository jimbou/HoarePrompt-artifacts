Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program correctly reads the input data, including the number of test cases, the length of the permutation, the duration of the game, and the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha.

2. It correctly initializes the scores of Bodya and Sasha to the values of the elements at their starting positions in the array `a`.

3. The program then enters a loop that continues until the game duration `k` is reduced to 0. In each iteration of the loop, it updates the positions of Bodya and Sasha based on the permutation `p`, and updates their scores accordingly.

4. The program uses the `max` function to ensure that the scores of Bodya and Sasha are updated to the maximum possible value, considering the remaining game duration `k`.

5. After the loop, the program compares the final scores of Bodya and Sasha and prints the winner accordingly.

6. The program handles the case where the scores are equal, printing "Draw" in such cases.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
