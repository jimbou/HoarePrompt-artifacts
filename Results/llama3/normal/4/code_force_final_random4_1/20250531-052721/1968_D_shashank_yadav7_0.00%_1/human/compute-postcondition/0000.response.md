Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains four integers (n, k, P_B, P_S) followed by two lists of n integers (p_1, ..., p_n) and (a_1, ..., a_n). n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer, 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n, and p_i and a_i are positive integers for all i.**

In natural language, the output state is that `t` has been assigned the value of the first test case, which is a positive integer. The stdin now contains one less test case than before, but the structure of each test case remains the same, with four integers and two lists of integers. The values of the other variables are not affected.
