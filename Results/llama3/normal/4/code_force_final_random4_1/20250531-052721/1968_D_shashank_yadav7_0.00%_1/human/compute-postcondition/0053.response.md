Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than n + 1, n is an integer greater than 1, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, sp is the integer at index s in list a plus the integer at index s in list a times (k-1), bp is the integer at index b in list a plus the integer at index b in list a times (k-1), bm is the integer at index b in list a times (k-2) plus the maximum of the integer at index b in list a times (k-2) and the integer at index b in list a times (k-1) plus the integer at index b in list a, sm is the integer at index s in list a times (k-2) plus the maximum of the integer at index s in list a times (k-2) and the integer at index s in list a times (k-1) plus the integer at index s in list a, s is the integer at index s in list p minus 1, b is the integer at index b in list p minus 1, i is 1, k is decreased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables t, n, p, a, sp, bp, bm, sm, s, b, i, and k remain the same as in the initial state.
