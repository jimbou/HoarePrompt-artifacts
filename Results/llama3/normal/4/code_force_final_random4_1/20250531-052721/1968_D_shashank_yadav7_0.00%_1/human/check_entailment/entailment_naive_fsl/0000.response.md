Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the game logic. The issue lies in the way it updates the scores of Bodya and Sasha. The program uses the maximum of the current score and the score that would be obtained by staying at the same position for the remaining turns. However, this is not the correct way to calculate the score.

The correct way to calculate the score is to add the value of the current position to the score at each turn, and then move to the next position according to the permutation. The program does not correctly implement this logic.

For example, consider the case where n = 4, k = 2, P_B = 3, P_S = 2, p = [4, 1, 2, 3], and a = [7, 2, 5, 6]. The program will output "Bodya", but the correct output should be "Draw".

The program also does not correctly handle the case where k is greater than n. In this case, the program will enter an infinite loop.

To fix these issues, the program needs to be modified to correctly implement the game logic and handle the case where k is greater than n.
