The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 2 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 2.
State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 2, n is an integer greater than 2, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, sp is the integer at index s in list a plus the integer at index s in list a plus the integer at index s in list a, bp is the integer at index b in list a plus the integer at index b in list a plus the integer at index b in list a, b is the integer at index b in list p minus 1 minus 1, s is the integer at index s in list p minus 1 minus 1, bm is the integer at index b in list a multiplied by (k-2) plus the maximum of the integer at index b in list a multiplied by (k-2) and the integer at index b in list a multiplied by (k-1) plus the integer at index b in list a plus the maximum of the integer at index b in list a multiplied by (k-2) plus the maximum of the integer at index b in list a multiplied by (k-2) and the integer at index b in list a multiplied by (k-1) plus the integer at index b in list a and the integer at index b in list a multiplied by (k-1) plus the maximum of the integer at index b in list a multiplied by (k-1) and the integer at index b in list a multiplied by (k-1) plus the integer at index b in list a, sm is the integer at index s in list a multiplied by (k-1) plus the maximum of the integer at index s in list a multiplied by (k-1) and the integer at index s in list a multiplied by (k-1) plus the integer at index s in list a plus the maximum of the integer at index s in list a multiplied by (k-1) plus the maximum of the integer at index s in list a multiplied by (k-1) and the integer at index s in list a multiplied by (k-1) plus the integer at index s in list a and the integer at index s in list a multiplied by (k-1) plus the maximum of the integer at index s in list a multiplied by (k-1) and the integer at index s in list a multiplied by (k-1) plus the integer at index s in list a, k is one less than its previous value. If k is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
