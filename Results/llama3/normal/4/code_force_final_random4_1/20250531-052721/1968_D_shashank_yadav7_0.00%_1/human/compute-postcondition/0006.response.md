Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 0, n is an integer greater than 0, k is 0, b is an integer minus 1, s is an integer minus 1, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, sp is the integer at index s in list a, bp is the integer at index b in list a, bm is the integer at index b in list a multiplied by (k-1) which is -1, sm is the integer at index s in list a multiplied by k which is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, but we exit the innermost loop or conditional statement.
