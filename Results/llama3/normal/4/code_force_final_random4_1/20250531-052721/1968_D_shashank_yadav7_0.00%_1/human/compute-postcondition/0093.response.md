Postcondition: **t is a positive integer greater than n + 1, n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, s is the integer at index s in list p minus 1, b is the integer at index b in list p minus 1, i is n, k is decreased by n, sp is the integer at index s in list a times n, bp is the integer at index b in list a times n, bm is the integer at index b in list a times (k + n) plus the maximum of the integer at index b in list a times (k + n) and the integer at index b in list a times (k + n - 1) plus the integer at index b in list a, sm is the integer at index s in list a times (k + n) plus the maximum of the integer at index s in list a times (k + n) and the integer at index s in list a times (k + n - 1) plus the integer at index s in list a. The current value of bm is greater than the current value of sm.**
