Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 0, n is an integer greater than 0, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, sp is the integer at index s in list a, bp is the integer at index b in list a. If k is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise, k is an integer minus 1, b is an integer minus 1, s is an integer minus 1, bm is the integer at index b in list a multiplied by (k-1), sm is the integer at index s in list a multiplied by k.***
