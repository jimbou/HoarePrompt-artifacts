Reasoning: 

The given program is incorrect. The list L is supposed to store the number of cards in each iteration of the while loop, but it is not being populated correctly. The line `L.append(m)` is missing, which should be added after `n -= m` to append the number of cards in the current iteration to the list L.

Additionally, the condition `if tot < k and k <= tot + a:` is incorrect. It should be `if tot < k and k <= tot + m:` because we are checking if k is within the range of the current iteration, and m is the number of cards in the current iteration, not a.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    
    L = []
    
    while n:
        m = (n + 1) // 2
        L.append(m)  # Add this line to populate the list L
        n -= m
        
    tot = 0
        
    pow = 1
        
    for a in L:
        if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
            print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))  # Corrected this line
            break
        tot += a
        pow *= 2
```

Correctness: **False**
