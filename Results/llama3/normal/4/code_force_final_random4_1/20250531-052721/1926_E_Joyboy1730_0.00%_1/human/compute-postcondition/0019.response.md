The only object in the loop head is variable `a` and list `L`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `L`. If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `L` has at least 1 element, `a` is the first element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the `a` is the second element in the list.
State: **t is at least 1, stdin contains t-2 pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= 10^9), n is 0, k is an integer, L is a list that must have at least 2 elements, a is the second element in the list, m is an integer equal to (n + 1) // 2 and less than the original value of n, n is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus m, tot is a, pow is 2.**
