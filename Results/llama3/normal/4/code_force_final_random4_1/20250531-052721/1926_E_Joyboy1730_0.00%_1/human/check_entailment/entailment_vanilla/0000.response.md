Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by first calculating the number of cards that are odd, then the number of cards that are twice an odd number, and so on. It stores these counts in a list `L`. Then, it iterates over the list to find the range in which the `k`-th card lies. Once it finds the range, it calculates the value of the `k`-th card by multiplying the power of 2 (which represents the current range) with the `k`-th odd number in that range.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

1. The calculation of `m` is incorrect. It should be `m = (n + 1) // 2` if `n` is odd, and `m = n // 2` if `n` is even. This is because when `n` is odd, we need to include the middle element in the count of odd numbers.

2. The list `L` is not being populated correctly. The loop that calculates `m` should also append `m` to the list `L`.

3. The loop that finds the range of the `k`-th card is incorrect. It should be `if tot < k and k <= tot + a:` instead of `if tot < k and k <= tot + a:`. This is because we want to find the range in which `k` lies, not `k - tot`.

4. The calculation of the `k`-th card is incorrect. It should be `print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))` instead of `print(pow * (2 * k - 1))`. This is because we want to find the `k`-th odd number in the current range, not the `k`-th odd number overall.

Here is the corrected program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        L = []
        pow = 1
        while n:
            if n % 2 == 1:
                m = (n + 1) // 2
            else:
                m = n // 2
            L.append(m)
            n -= m
            pow *= 2
        tot = 0
        for a in L:
            if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
                print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
                break
            tot += a
            k -= tot
            pow //= 2
```

Correctness: **False**
