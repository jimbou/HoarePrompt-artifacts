Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is at least 1, stdin contains t-1 pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= 10^9), n is 0, k is an integer, L is an empty list, m is an integer equal to (n + 1) // 2 and less than the original value of n, n is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus m, tot is 0, pow is 1
Code of the loop:
for a in L:
    if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
        print(pow * (2 * k - 1))
        break
    tot += a
    k -= tot
    pow *= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is at least 1, stdin contains t-2 pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= 10^9), n is 0, k is an integer, L is a list that must have at least 1 element, a is the first element in the list, m is an integer equal to (n + 1) // 2 and less than the original value of n, n is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus m, tot is a, pow is 2. If tot is less than k and k is less than or equal to tot plus a, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is at least 1, stdin contains t-2 pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= 10^9), n is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus m, m is an integer equal to (n + 1) // 2 and less than the original value of n, L is a list that must have at least 2 elements, a is the second element in the list, k is an integer equal to its original value minus tot, tot is the sum of a and its original value, pow is 4. If tot is less than k and k is less than or equal to tot plus a, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is at least 1, stdin contains t-2 pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= 10^9), n is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus m, m is an integer equal to (n + 1) // 2 and less than the original value of n, L is a list that must have at least 3 elements, a is the third element in the list, k is an integer equal to its original value minus tot, tot is the sum of a and its original value, pow is 8. If tot is less than k and k is less than or equal to tot plus a, then the most internal loop or if statement is terminated, and 4 * (2 * k - 1) is printed (where k is an integer equal to its original value minus tot, and tot is the sum of a and its original value).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
