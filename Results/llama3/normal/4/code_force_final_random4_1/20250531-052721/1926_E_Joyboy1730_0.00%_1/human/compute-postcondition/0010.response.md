Output State: **t is at least 1, stdin contains t-1 pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= 10^9), n is 0, k is an integer, L is an empty list, m is an integer equal to (n + 1) // 2 and less than the original value of n, n is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus m.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `n` becomes 0, and the variable `m` is the result of the last iteration of the loop, which is the integer division of `n + 1` by 2. The other variables `t`, `k`, and `L` remain unchanged.
