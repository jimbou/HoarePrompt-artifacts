According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable n. If n is not equal to 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, n is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus m. For the loop to execute the first time, n must be greater than 0. Since m is equal to (n + 1) // 2 and less than the original value of n, the original value of n must be greater than 1. Therefore, the state of n needs to be adjusted to n is a positive integer equal to its original value minus m, and the original value of n must be greater than 1.

State: **t is at least 2, stdin contains t-3 pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= 10^9), n is a positive integer equal to its original value minus m, m is an integer equal to (n + 1) // 2 and less than the original value of n, k is an integer, L is an empty list, tot is 0, pow is 1**
