Output State: **t is at least 3, n is 0, k is an integer, m is 0, L is an empty list, tot is 0, pow is 1, stdin contains t-5 pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= 10^9)**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the variable 'n' has been reduced to 0, and the variable 'm' has also been reduced to 0. The other variables remain unchanged, with 't' still being at least 3, 'k' being an integer, 'L' being an empty list, 'tot' being 0, 'pow' being 1, and the stdin containing t-5 pairs of integers n and k, where 1 <= k <= 10^9.
