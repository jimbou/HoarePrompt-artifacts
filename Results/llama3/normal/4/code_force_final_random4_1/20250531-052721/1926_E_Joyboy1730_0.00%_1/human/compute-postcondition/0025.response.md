To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `a` and `L`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `L`. If the list has at least 3 elements, the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `L` has at least 2 elements, `a` is the second element in the list.

For the loop to be executed one more time, the list `L` must have at least 3 elements, and `a` must be the third element in the list.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` pairs of integers `n` and `k` (1 <= `k` <= 10^9), `n` is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus `m`, `m` is an integer equal to (`n` + 1) // 2 and less than the original value of `n`, `L` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `a` is the third element in the list, `k` is an integer equal to its original value minus `tot`, `tot` is the sum of `a` and its original value, `pow` is 4**
