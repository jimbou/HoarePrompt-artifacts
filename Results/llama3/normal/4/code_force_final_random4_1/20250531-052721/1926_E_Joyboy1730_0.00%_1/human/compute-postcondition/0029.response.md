Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` pairs of integers `n` and `k` (1 <= `k` <= 10^9), `n` is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus `m`, `m` is an integer equal to (`n` + 1) // 2 and less than the original value of `n`, `L` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `a` is the third element in the list, `k` is an integer equal to its original value minus `tot`, `tot` is the sum of `a` and its original value, `pow` is 4. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot` plus `a`, then the most internal loop or if statement is terminated, and 4 * (2 * k - 1) is printed (where k is an integer equal to its original value minus tot, and tot is the sum of a and its original value).***
