Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `stdin` contains `t-1` pairs of integers `n` and `k` (1 <= `k` <= 10^9), `n` is 0, `k` is an integer, `L` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `a` is the first element in the list, `m` is an integer equal to (`n` + 1) // 2 and less than the original value of `n`, `n` is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus `m`, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1. The current value of `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to the sum of `tot` and `a`***
