The code snippet modifies the values of `m` and `n`. The first line assigns the value of `(n + 1) // 2` to `m`. Since `n` is not equal to 0, and `m` was `n // 2`, the new value of `m` is the ceiling of the average of `n` and 1. The second line subtracts the value of `m` from `n`, effectively making `n` equal to the floor of the average of `n` and -1.

No other variables are affected by the code snippet. The value of `t` remains at least 3, `k` remains an integer, `L` remains an empty list, `tot` remains 0, and `pow` remains 1. Stdin still contains `t-5` pairs of integers `n` and `k`.

Output State: **t is at least 3, n is the floor of the average of its original value and -1, k is an integer, m is the ceiling of the average of n and 1, L is an empty list, tot is 0, pow is 1, stdin contains t-5 pairs of integers n and k**
