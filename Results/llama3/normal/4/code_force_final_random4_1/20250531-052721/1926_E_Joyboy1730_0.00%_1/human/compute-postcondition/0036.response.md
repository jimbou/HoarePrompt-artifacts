The variable in the loop head is variable n, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable n.  If n is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is a positive integer equal to its original value minus m, and m is an integer equal to (n + 1) // 2 and less than the original value of n. So for the loop to be executed one more time n must be greater than 0.
State: **t is at least 2, n is a positive integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus m, m is an integer equal to (n + 1) // 2 and less than the original value of n, k is an integer, L is an empty list, tot is 0, pow is 1, stdin contains t-3 pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= 10^9)**
