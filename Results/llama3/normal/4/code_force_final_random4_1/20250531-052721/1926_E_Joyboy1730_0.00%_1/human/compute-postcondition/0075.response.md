The code prints the product of `pow` and `2 * k - 1`, where `pow` is 1 and `k` is an integer. Since `k` is an integer, `2 * k - 1` will also be an integer. Therefore, the product will be an integer.

Output: **`t` is at least 3, `n` is 0, `k` is an integer, `m` is 0, `L` is a list with at least 1 element, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-5` pairs of integers `n` and `k` (1 <= `k` <= 10^9), `a` is the first element of `L`. The current value of `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to the sum of `tot` and `a`, and this is printed: `pow * (2 * k - 1)` which is equal to `2 * k - 1`**
