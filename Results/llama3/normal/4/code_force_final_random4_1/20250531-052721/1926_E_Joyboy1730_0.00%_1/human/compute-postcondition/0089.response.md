Postcondition: ***t is at least 3, n is 0, k is an integer, m is 0, L is a list with at least 3 elements, pow is 4 times its original value, a is the third element of L, tot is equal to its original value plus the second element of L. If tot is less than k and k is less than or equal to tot plus a, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
