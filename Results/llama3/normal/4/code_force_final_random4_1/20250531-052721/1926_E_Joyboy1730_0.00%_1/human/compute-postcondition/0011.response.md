Output State: **t is at least 1, stdin contains t-1 pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= 10^9), n is 0, k is an integer, L is an empty list, m is an integer equal to (n + 1) // 2 and less than the original value of n, n is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus m, tot is 0, pow is 1**

The code initializes two new variables, `tot` and `pow`, and assigns them the values 0 and 1, respectively. The rest of the variables remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the code. The state of `t`, `stdin`, `n`, `k`, `L`, and `m` remains the same as in the initial state.
