Output State: **t is at least 3, n is an integer, k is an integer, m is 0, L is an empty list, tot is 0, pow is 1, stdin contains t-5 pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= 10^9)**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to the integer value from the input, and the value of `k` has also been updated to the integer value from the input. The list `L` has been reinitialized to an empty list. All other variables remain unchanged. The stdin now contains `t-5` pairs of integers `n` and `k` (1 <= k <= 10^9).
