Output State: **t is at least 2, n is 0, m is 0, k is an integer, L is a list with at least 1 element, tot is a + tot, pow is 2 * pow, stdin contains t-4 pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= 10^9), a is the first element in the list L.**

The code increments `tot` by the value of `a`, making `tot` equal to `a + tot`. Then, it decrements `k` by the value of `tot`, making `k` equal to `k - tot`. Finally, it doubles the value of `pow`, making `pow` equal to `2 * pow`. No other variables are affected.
