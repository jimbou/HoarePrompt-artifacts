The code prints the product of `pow` and `2 * k - 1`, where `pow` is 1 and `k` is an integer.

Since `pow` is 1, the product will be equal to `2 * k - 1`.

The value of `k` is not explicitly given, but it is described as an integer. Therefore, the output will be a value that is 1 less than twice the value of `k`.

Output: **2 * k - 1 (where k is an integer)**
