According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50000 inclusive, which ensures that the loop will execute. So, we only need to adjust the state of `t` to be at least 1.

State: **`t` is at least 1, stdin contains t pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9)**
