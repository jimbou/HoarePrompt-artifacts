Output State: **t is at least 1, stdin contains t-1 pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9), n is a non-zero integer greater than 0, k is an integer, L is an empty list, m is an integer equal to (n + 1) // 2 and less than the original value of n, n is a non-zero integer equal to its original value minus m and n is greater than 0**

The code block consists of two lines. The first line calculates the value of `m` as `(n + 1) // 2`, which is the integer division of `n + 1` by 2. This value is less than the original value of `n`. The second line subtracts the value of `m` from `n`, making `n` equal to its original value minus `m`. Since `n` is a non-zero integer greater than 0, the subtraction does not change this property.

The values of `t`, `stdin`, `k`, and `L` are not affected by the code block. The value of `m` is calculated based on the original value of `n`, and the value of `n` is updated based on the calculated value of `m`.
