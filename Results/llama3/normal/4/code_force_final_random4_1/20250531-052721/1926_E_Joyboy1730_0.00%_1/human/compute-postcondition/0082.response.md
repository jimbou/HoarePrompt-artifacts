Output State: **t is at least 3, n is 0, k is an integer, m is 0, L is a list with at least 2 elements, tot is equal to its original value plus the second element of L, pow is 2 times its original value, a is the second element of L, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables t, n, k, m, L, tot, pow, and a remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
