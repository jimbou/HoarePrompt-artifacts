Postcondition: ***t is at least 2, n is 0, m is 0, k is an integer, L is a list with at least 2 elements, tot is a + tot, pow is 2 * pow, stdin contains t-4 pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= 10^9), a is the second element in the list L. If tot < k and k <= tot + a, then pow * (2 * k - 1) is printed where pow is 2 * pow and k is an integer, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
