Output State: **t is at least 3, n is 0, k is an integer less than or equal to its original value minus tot, m is 0, L is a list with at least 3 elements, pow is 8 times its original value, a is the third element of L, tot is equal to its original value plus the second element of L plus a.**

In this final state, the value of `tot` has increased by `a`, and `k` has decreased by the new value of `tot`. The value of `pow` has doubled. All other variables remain unchanged.
