To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to adjust the state of the variable `n` since it is the only variable in the loop head.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is not zero (`while n:`). Right before the loop, `n` is an integer, but being an integer does not guarantee that the loop will execute. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to ensure it is not zero.

State: **t is at least 1, stdin contains t-1 pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9), n is a non-zero integer, k is an integer, L is an empty list**
