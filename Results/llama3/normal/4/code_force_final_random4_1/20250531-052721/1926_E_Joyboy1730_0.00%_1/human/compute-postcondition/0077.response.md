Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 3, `n` is 0, `k` is an integer, `m` is 0, `L` is a list with at least 1 element, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1, `a` is the first element of `L`. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
