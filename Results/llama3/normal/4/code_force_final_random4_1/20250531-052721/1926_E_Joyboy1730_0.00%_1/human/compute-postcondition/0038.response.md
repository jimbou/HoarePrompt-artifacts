According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus `m`, `m` is an integer equal to `(n + 1) // 2` and less than the original value of `n`. Since `m` is less than the original value of `n`, `n` being a positive integer greater than 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **t is at least 2, n is greater than 0, m is an integer equal to (n + 1) // 2 and less than the original value of n, k is an integer, L is an empty list, tot is 0, pow is 1, stdin contains t-3 pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= 10^9)**
