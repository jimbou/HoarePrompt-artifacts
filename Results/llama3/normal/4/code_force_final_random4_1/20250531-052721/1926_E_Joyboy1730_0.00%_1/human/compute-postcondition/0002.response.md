Output State: **t is at least 1, stdin contains t-1 pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9), n is an integer, k is an integer, L is an empty list**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The stdin initially contained `t` pairs of integers, but after executing the first line, one pair is read and `t-1` pairs remain. The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the integers read from the input. The list `L` is initialized as an empty list.
