Output State: **t is at least 2, n is 0, m is 0, k is an integer, L is a list with at least 2 elements, tot is a + tot, pow is 2 * pow, stdin contains t-5 pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= 10^9), a is the second element in the list L, and this is printed: pow * (2 * k - 1) where pow is 2 * pow and k is an integer, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables t, n, m, k, L, tot, pow, and a do not change. The stdin now contains t-5 pairs of integers n and k. The expression pow * (2 * k - 1) is still printed, where pow is 2 * pow and k is an integer. However, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
