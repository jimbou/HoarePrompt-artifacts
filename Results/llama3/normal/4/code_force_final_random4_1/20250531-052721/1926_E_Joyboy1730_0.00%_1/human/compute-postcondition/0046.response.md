Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `n` is 0, `m` is 0, `k` is an integer, `L` is a list with at least 1 element, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` pairs of integers `n` and `k` (1 <= `k` <= 10^9), `a` is the first element in the list `L`, the current value of `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to the sum of `tot` and `a`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and 2 * k - 1 has been printed.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, because the `break` statement does not change any variable values. The only change is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement. Additionally, the value `2 * k - 1` has been printed, but this does not affect the state of the variables.
