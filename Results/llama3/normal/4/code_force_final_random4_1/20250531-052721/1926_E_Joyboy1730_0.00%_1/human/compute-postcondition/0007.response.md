Output State: **t is at least 1, stdin contains t-1 pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9), n is a non-zero integer greater than 0, k is an integer, L is an empty list, m is an integer equal to (n + 1) // 2 and less than the original value of n, n is a non-zero integer equal to its original value minus m**

The code snippet provided does not modify the initial state in any way. The first line calculates the value of `m` as `(n + 1) // 2`, but this value is already given in the initial state. The second line subtracts `m` from `n`, but since `n` is already defined as its original value minus `m`, this operation does not change the value of `n`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
