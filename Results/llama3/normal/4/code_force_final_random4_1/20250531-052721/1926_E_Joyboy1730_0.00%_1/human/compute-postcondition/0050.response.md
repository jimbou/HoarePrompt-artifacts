The code prints the product of `pow` and `2 * k - 1`, where `pow` is twice its initial value and `k` is an integer read from the standard input.

Since `pow` is initially `2 * pow`, we can rewrite this as `2 * pow * (2 * k - 1)`. 

The value of `k` is an integer read from the standard input, which is at least 1 and at most 10^9.

Output: **2 * pow * (2 * k - 1) (where pow is twice its initial value and k is an integer read from the standard input)**
