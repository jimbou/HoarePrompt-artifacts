Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `n` is 0, `k` is an integer, `m` is 0, `L` is a list with at least 3 elements, `pow` is 4 times its original value, `a` is the third element of `L`, `tot` is equal to its original value plus the second element of `L`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their initial values, and the only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `L`, `pow`, `a`, and `tot` remain the same as in the initial state.
