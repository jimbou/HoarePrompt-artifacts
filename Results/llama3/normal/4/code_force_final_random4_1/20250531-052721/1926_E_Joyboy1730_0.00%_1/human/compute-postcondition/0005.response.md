The variable in the loop head is variable n, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable n.  If n is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is a non-zero integer equal to its original value minus m. For the loop to be executed one more time, n must be greater than 0 after subtracting m, so n's original value must be greater than m. Since m is (n + 1) // 2, n's original value must be greater than (n + 1) // 2. Therefore, n's original value must be greater than or equal to 2. Since n is a non-zero integer, n's original value must be greater than or equal to 2. Since n is a non-zero integer, n's original value must be greater than or equal to 2. Since n is a non-zero integer, n's original value must be greater than or equal to 2. Since n is a non-zero integer, n's original value must be greater than or equal to 2.
