Postcondition: **`t` is at least 2, `n` is 0, `m` is 0, `k` is an integer, `L` is a list with at least 1 element, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` pairs of integers `n` and `k` (1 <= `k` <= 10^9), `a` is the first element in the list `L`. The current value of `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to the sum of `tot` and `a`.**
