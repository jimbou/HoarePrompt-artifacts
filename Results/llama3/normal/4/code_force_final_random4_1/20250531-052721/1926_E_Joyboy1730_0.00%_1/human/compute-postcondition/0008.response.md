The only variable in the loop head is variable n, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable n. If n is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is a non-zero integer equal to its original value minus m. For the loop to be executed one more time, n must be greater than 0.
State: **t is at least 1, stdin contains t-1 pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9), n is a non-zero integer greater than 0, k is an integer, L is an empty list, m is an integer equal to (n + 1) // 2 and less than the original value of n, n is a non-zero integer equal to its original value minus m and n is greater than 0**
