Output State: **t is at least 2, n is a positive integer equal to its original value minus m, m is an integer equal to (n + 1) // 2 and less than the original value of n, k is an integer, L is an empty list, tot is 0, pow is 1, stdin contains t-3 pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= 10^9)**

The code modifies the values of `n` and `m`. The first line calculates the value of `m` as `(n + 1) // 2`, which is less than the original value of `n`. The second line subtracts `m` from `n`, making `n` equal to its original value minus `m`. The other variables remain unchanged.
