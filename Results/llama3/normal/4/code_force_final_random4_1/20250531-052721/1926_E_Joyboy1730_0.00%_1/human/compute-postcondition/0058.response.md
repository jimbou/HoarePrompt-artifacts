Output State: **t is at least 2, n is 0, m is 0, k is an integer, L is a list with at least 3 elements, tot is a + tot + a, pow is 4 * pow, if tot < k and k <= tot + a, then pow * (2 * k - 1) is printed where pow is 2 * pow and k is an integer, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, a is the third element in the list, and this is printed: pow * (2 * k - 1) where pow is 2 * pow and k is an integer, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code executes a break statement, which means we exit the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement. The conditions and prints that were executed before the break statement are still valid.
