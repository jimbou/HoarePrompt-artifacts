Output State: **t is at least 2, n is greater than 0 and less than its original value, m is an integer equal to (n + 1) // 2 and less than the original value of n, k is an integer, L is an empty list, tot is 0, pow is 1, stdin contains t-3 pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= 10^9)**

The code block modifies the values of `m` and `n`. The first line assigns the value of `(n + 1) // 2` to `m`, which is less than the original value of `n`. The second line subtracts the value of `m` from `n`, making `n` less than its original value. The other variables remain unchanged.
