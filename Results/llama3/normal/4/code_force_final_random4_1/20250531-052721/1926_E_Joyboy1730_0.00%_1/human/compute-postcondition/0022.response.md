Output State: **t is at least 1, stdin contains t-2 pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= 10^9), n is 0, k is an integer, L is a list that must have at least 2 elements, a is the second element in the list, m is an integer equal to (n + 1) // 2 and less than the original value of n, n is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus m, tot is a, pow is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables are the same as in the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The stdin still contains t-2 pairs of integers n and k, and the list L still has at least 2 elements. The values of m, n, tot, and pow remain the same as in the initial state.
