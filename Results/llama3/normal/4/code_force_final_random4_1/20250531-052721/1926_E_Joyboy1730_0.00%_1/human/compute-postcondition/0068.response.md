The only variable in the loop head is variable n, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable n.  If n is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is not equal to 0, So for the loop to be executed one more time n must still be not equal to 0.
State: **t is at least 3, n is not equal to 0, k is an integer, m is n // 2, L is an empty list, tot is 0, pow is 1, stdin contains t-5 pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= 10^9)**
