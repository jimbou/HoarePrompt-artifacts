State: **t is at least 2, n is 0, m is 0, k is an integer, L is a list with at least 3 elements, tot is a + tot + a, pow is 4 * pow, if tot < k and k <= tot + a, then pow * (2 * k - 1) is printed where pow is 2 * pow and k is an integer, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, a is the third element in the list**
