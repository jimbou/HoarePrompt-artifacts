According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable n. If n is not equal to 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, n is an integer, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to n is not equal to 0.

State: **t is at least 3, n is not equal to 0, k is an integer, m is 0, L is an empty list, tot is 0, pow is 1, stdin contains t-5 pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= 10^9)**
