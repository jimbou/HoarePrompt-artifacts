According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is not equal to 0, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is not equal to 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **t is at least 3, n is not equal to 0, k is an integer, m is (n + 1) // 2, L is an empty list, tot is 0, pow is 1, stdin contains t-5 pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= 10^9)**
