Postcondition: ***t is at least 1, stdin contains t-2 pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= 10^9), n is 0, k is an integer, L is a list that must have at least 2 elements, a is the second element in the list, m is an integer equal to (n + 1) // 2 and less than the original value of n, n is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus m, tot is a, pow is 2. If tot is less than k and k is less than or equal to tot plus a, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
