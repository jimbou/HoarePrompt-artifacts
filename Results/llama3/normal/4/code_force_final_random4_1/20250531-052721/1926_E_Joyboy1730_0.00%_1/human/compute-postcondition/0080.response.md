The code prints the result of the expression `pow * (2 * k - 1)`. 

`pow` is 2 times its original value, but the original value of `pow` is not specified. However, we can describe its value as `2 * original value of pow`.

`k` is an integer, but its exact value is not specified.

The expression `2 * k - 1` is calculated by multiplying `k` by 2 and then subtracting 1.

Therefore, the output will be the product of `2 * original value of pow` and `2 * k - 1`.

Output: **(2 * original value of pow) * (2 * k - 1)**
