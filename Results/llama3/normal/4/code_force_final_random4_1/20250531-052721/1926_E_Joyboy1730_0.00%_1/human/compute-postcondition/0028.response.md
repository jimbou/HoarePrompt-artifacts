Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` pairs of integers `n` and `k` (1 <= `k` <= 10^9), `n` is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus `m`, `m` is an integer equal to (`n` + 1) // 2 and less than the original value of `n`, `L` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `a` is the third element in the list, `k` is an integer equal to its original value minus `tot`, `tot` is the sum of `a` and its original value, `pow` is 4, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and 4 * (2 * k - 1) is printed (where k is an integer equal to its original value minus tot, and tot is the sum of a and its original value).**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables do not change, but the program execution is interrupted by the break statement. The expression 4 * (2 * k - 1) is printed, where k is an integer equal to its original value minus tot, and tot is the sum of a and its original value.
