Postcondition: ***t is at least 3, n is 0, k is an integer, m is 0, L is a list with at least 2 elements, pow is 2 times its original value, a is the second element of L. If tot is less than k and k is less than or equal to tot plus a, then tot is equal to its original value plus the second element of L and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
