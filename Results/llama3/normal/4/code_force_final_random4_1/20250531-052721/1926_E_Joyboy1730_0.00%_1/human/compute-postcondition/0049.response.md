The only variable in the loop head is variable a, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list L. If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, L has at least 1 element, a is the first element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the a is the second element in the list.
State: **t is at least 2, n is 0, m is 0, k is an integer, L is a list with at least 2 elements, tot is a + tot, pow is 2 * pow, stdin contains t-4 pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= 10^9), a is the second element in the list L.**
