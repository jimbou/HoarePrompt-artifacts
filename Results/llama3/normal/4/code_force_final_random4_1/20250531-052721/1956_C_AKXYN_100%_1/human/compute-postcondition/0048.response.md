The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is decreased by 1 so `i` is `n - 2` and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer that must be greater than 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `mat` is a 2D list with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains numbers from 1 to `n`, `res` is the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, and this is printed: the number 2 followed by the value of `i` which is equal to `n - 2`, and the numbers from 1 to `n` which is equal to `range(1, n + 1)`**
