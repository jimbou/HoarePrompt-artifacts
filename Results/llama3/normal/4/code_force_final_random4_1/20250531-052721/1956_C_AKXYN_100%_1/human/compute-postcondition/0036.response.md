The code prints the value of `res` and the result of the expression `n << 1`.

`res` is the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`. This is a sum of products of consecutive integers, where each product is of the form `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`. Since `i` ranges from 0 to `n-1`, the sum will include `n` terms.

The expression `n << 1` is a bitwise left shift operation, which is equivalent to multiplying `n` by 2.

Output: **the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to n-1, 2n (where n is a positive integer)**
