Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `mat` is a 2D list with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains numbers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 7 + (2 + 1) * (2 * 2 + 1) = 7 + 3 * 5 = 7 + 15 = 22, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, and this is printed: the number 2 followed by the value of `i` which is equal to 2, and the numbers from 1 to `n` which is equal to `range(1, n + 1)`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still greater than 2, `i` is still 2, the 2D list `mat` remains unchanged with `n` rows and `n` columns containing numbers from 1 to `n`, the value of `res` has been updated to 22, the value of `_` is still 2, there is one less test case in `stdin`, and the output still includes the number 2, the value of `i` which is 2, and the numbers from 1 to `n`.
