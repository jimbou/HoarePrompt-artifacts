The code prints the string '2 %d' % i, where i is equal to n, and the numbers from 1 to n (inclusive). The string '2 %d' % i is a formatted string where %d is a placeholder for an integer, and i is the integer that will replace the placeholder. So, '2 %d' % i is equivalent to '2 ' + str(i) which is '2 ' + str(n). The * operator in *range(1, n + 1) unpacks the range object into separate arguments to the print function, so the numbers from 1 to n (inclusive) are printed as separate arguments.
Output: **'2 ' + str(n), and the numbers from 1 to n (inclusive)**
