The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is a positive integer and i is n-1 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now n.
State: **`n` is a positive integer that must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `mat` is a 2D list with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains numbers from 1 to `n`, `res` is the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, and this is printed: the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from 0 to `n-1` which is equal to `res` and the value of `n` shifted left by 1 bit which is equal to `n * 2`**
