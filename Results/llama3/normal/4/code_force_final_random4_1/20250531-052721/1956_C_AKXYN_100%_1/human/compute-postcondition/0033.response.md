To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(n):`. The objects involved are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is a positive integer that is at least 1.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Since `n` is at least 1, it must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables `mat`, `res`, `_`, and `stdin` are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `i` is 2, `mat` is a 2D list with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains numbers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 1 + (1 + 1) * (2 * 1 + 1), `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one**
