Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `mat` is a 2D list with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains numbers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 7, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, and this is printed: the number 2 followed by the value of `i` which is equal to 1, and the numbers from 1 to `n` which is equal to `range(1, n + 1)`**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to 7, which is the result of the expression `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` where `i` is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The program has also printed the number 2, the value of `i` (which is 1), and the numbers from 1 to `n` (which is `range(1, n + 1)`). The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
