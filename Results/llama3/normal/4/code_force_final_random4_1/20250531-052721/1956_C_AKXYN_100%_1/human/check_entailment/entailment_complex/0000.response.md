Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the size of the matrix for each test case.
2.  It initializes a 2D list `mat` with `n` rows and `n` columns, where each row contains numbers from 1 to `n`. This is not actually used in the program, but it's not incorrect either.
3.  The program calculates the sum of the products of consecutive integers from 1 to `n` using the formula `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`. This is a correct calculation for the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix.
4.  It prints the calculated sum and twice the value of `n`, which is the number of operations required to achieve this sum.
5.  The program then prints a series of strings and numbers in a specific pattern. These strings and numbers represent the operations required to achieve the maximum sum. The pattern is correct, and it ensures that each row and column of the matrix is filled with numbers from 1 to `n` in a way that maximizes the sum.

Overall, the program correctly solves the problem and produces the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
