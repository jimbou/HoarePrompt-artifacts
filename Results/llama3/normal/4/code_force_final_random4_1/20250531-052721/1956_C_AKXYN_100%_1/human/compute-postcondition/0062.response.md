Output State: **n is an integer, i is n - 1, mat is a 2D list with n rows and n columns where each row contains numbers from 1 to n, res is the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to n - 1, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and this is printed: the number 2 followed by the value of i which is equal to n - 1, and the numbers from 1 to n which is equal to range(1, n + 1)**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: The loop has finished executing, and the variable `i` has reached its final value of `n - 1`. The variable `res` now holds the sum of the products of `(i + 1)` and `(2 * i + 1)` for all values of `i` from 0 to `n - 1`. The other variables, `n`, `mat`, `_`, `stdin`, and the printed output, remain unchanged.
