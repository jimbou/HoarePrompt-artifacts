Output: **`n` is a positive integer that must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `mat` is a 2D list with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains numbers from 1 to `n`, `res` is the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, and this is printed: the number 1 followed by the value of `n` which is equal to `i`, and the numbers from 1 to `n` which is equal to `range(1, n + 1)`**
