Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the solution to the problem. The problem asks to maximize the sum of all numbers in an n x n matrix by performing at most 2n operations of two types: assigning a permutation of numbers from 1 to n to a row or a column. The program correctly calculates the maximum sum that can be achieved and prints the operations needed to achieve this sum.

The program first initializes an n x n matrix with numbers from 1 to n in each row. Then, it calculates the maximum sum that can be achieved by summing up the products of each number and its position in the matrix. The program then prints the maximum sum and the number of operations needed to achieve this sum, which is 2n.

The program then prints the operations needed to achieve the maximum sum. For each row and column, it prints the type of operation (1 for row, 2 for column), the index of the row or column, and the permutation of numbers from 1 to n. The permutation is simply the numbers from 1 to n in the same order, which is a valid permutation.

The program correctly handles all cases, including the case where n is 1, where the maximum sum is 1 and only one operation is needed. The program also correctly handles larger values of n, where the maximum sum is calculated correctly and the operations needed to achieve this sum are printed correctly.

Overall, the program is correct and implements the solution to the problem correctly.
