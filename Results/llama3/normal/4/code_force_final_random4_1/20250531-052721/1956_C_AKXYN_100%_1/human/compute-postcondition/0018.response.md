Output: **`n` is a positive integer that must be greater than or equal to `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `mat` is a 2D list with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains numbers from 1 to `n`, `res` is `n*(n+1)*(2n+1)/3 - n*(n+1)`, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, and this is printed: '1' followed by the value of `i` which is `n-1`, and the numbers from 1 to `n` which are the first `n` positive integers**
