The code prints the value of `res` which is the sum of the first `n` positive integers, and the value of `n << 1` which is equivalent to `n * 2`.

Output: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n-1`, `mat` is a 2D list with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains numbers from 1 to `n`, `res` is `n*(n+1)*(2n+1)/3`, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, and this is printed: the sum of the first `n` positive integers which is `n*(n+1)*(2n+1)/3` and `n` multiplied by 2 which is `n * 2`**
