Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n-1`, `mat` is a 2D list with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains numbers from 1 to `n`, `res` is `n*(n+1)*(2n+1)/3`, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: The loop has finished executing, and the variable `i` has reached its final value of `n-1`. The 2D list `mat` remains unchanged, and the variable `res` now holds the sum of the first `n` cubes, which is given by the formula `n*(n+1)*(2n+1)/3`. The other variables `_` and `stdin` remain unchanged.
