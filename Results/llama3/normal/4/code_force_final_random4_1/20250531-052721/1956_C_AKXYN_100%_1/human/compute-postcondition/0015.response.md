Output: **`n` is a positive integer that must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `mat` is a 2D list with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains numbers from 1 to `n`, `res` is `n*(n+1)*(2n+1)/3`, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, and this is printed: '2' followed by the value of `i` which is `n`, and the numbers from 1 to `n` which are the first `n` positive integers**
