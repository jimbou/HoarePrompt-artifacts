Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `mat` is a 2D list with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains numbers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 7, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to 7, which is the result of the expression `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` where `i` is 1. The values of the other variables, including `n`, `i`, `mat`, and `_`, remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
