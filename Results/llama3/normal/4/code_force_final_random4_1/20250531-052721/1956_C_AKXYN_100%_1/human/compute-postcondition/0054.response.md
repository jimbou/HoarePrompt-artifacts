The only variable in the loop head is variable  `_` and `stdin`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `stdin`. If `_` is less than the number of test cases in `stdin` the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one. So for the loop to be executed one more time `_` is 2 and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two.
State: **`n` is a positive integer that must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `mat` is a 2D list with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains numbers from 1 to `n`, `res` is the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, and this is printed: the number 2 followed by the value of `i` which is equal to 0, and the numbers from 1 to `n` which is equal to `range(1, n + 1)`**
