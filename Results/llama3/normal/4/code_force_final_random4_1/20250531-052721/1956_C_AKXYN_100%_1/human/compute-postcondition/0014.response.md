The `print` statement will print a string that starts with '2' followed by the value of `i`, which is equal to `n`, and then the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

Since `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, the value of `i` is also a positive integer greater than 0. The `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

Therefore, the output will be a string that starts with '2', followed by the value of `n`, and then the numbers from 1 to `n`.

Output: **2[n] 1 2 3 ... [n] (where [n] is the value of n and the numbers 1 to n are the first n positive integers)**
