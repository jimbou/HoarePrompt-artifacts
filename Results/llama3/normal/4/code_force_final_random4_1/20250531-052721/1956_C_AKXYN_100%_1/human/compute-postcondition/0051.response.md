The `print` statement will print a string that starts with '2', followed by the value of `i`, which is `n - 2`, and then the numbers from 1 to `n`.

Since `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` will be a positive integer as well. The value of `i` is `n - 2`, which means it will be one less than `n - 1`.

The `*range(1, n + 1)` part of the print statement will print the numbers from 1 to `n`, inclusive.

So, the output will be a string that starts with '2', followed by the value of `i` (which is `n - 2`), and then the numbers from 1 to `n`.

Output: **2 [n - 2] 1 2 3 ... n (where n is a positive integer greater than 1)**
