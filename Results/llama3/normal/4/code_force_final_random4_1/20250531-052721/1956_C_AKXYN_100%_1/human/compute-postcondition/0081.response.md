Output State: **`n` is a positive integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `mat` is a 2D list with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains numbers from 1 to `n`, `res` is the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `_` is equal to the number of test cases, `stdin` is empty, and this is printed: the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from 0 to `n-1` which is equal to `res`, and the number 2 multiplied by `n` which is equal to `n << 1`, and the string '1 %d' % i, and the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) are being printed, and the string '2 %d' % i is printed where `i` is equal to `n`, and the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) are being printed, and the string '1 %d' % i is printed where `i` is equal to `n - 1`, and the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) are being printed, and the string '2 %d' % i is printed where `i` is equal to `n - 1`, and the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) are being printed, and the string '1 %d' % i is printed where `i` is equal to `n - 2`, and the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) are being printed, and the string '2 %d' % i is printed where `i` is equal to `n - 2`, and the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) are being printed, and so on until `i` is equal to 1, and the string '1 %d' % i is printed where `i` is equal to 1, and the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) are being printed, and the string '2 %d' % i is printed where `i` is equal to 1, and the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) are being printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing all the test cases, and the variables `n`, `i`, `mat`, `res`, and `_` have reached their final values. The variable `n` is still a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `mat` is a 2D list with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains numbers from 1 to `n`, `res` is the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, and `_` is equal to the number of test cases. The input `stdin` is empty because all the test cases have been processed. The output includes the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, the number 2 multiplied by `n`, and a series of strings and numbers printed in a specific pattern.
