The only variables in the loop head are variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is `n - 1` does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is `n` and `n` is greater than 0.
State: **`n` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, mat is a 2D list with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains numbers from 1 to `n`, res is the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to `n` - 1, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and this is printed: the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to `n` - 1 which is equal to res, and the number 2 multiplied by `n` which is equal to `n` << 1**
