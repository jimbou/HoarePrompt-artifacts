Output State: **n is an integer, i is 0, mat is a 2D list with n rows and n columns where each row contains numbers from 1 to n, res is 0, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and this is printed: the number 2 followed by the value of i which is equal to 0, and the numbers from 1 to n which is equal to range(1, n + 1)**

In this output state, the value of `n` is now an integer that was read from the input, replacing its original value as a positive integer greater than 0. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 0. The 2D list `mat` is reinitialized with `n` rows and `n` columns, where each row contains numbers from 1 to `n`. The variable `res` is reset to 0. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 2. The input buffer `stdin` now contains one less test case. The output includes the number 2, the value of `i` which is 0, and the numbers from 1 to `n` which is equal to `range(1, n + 1)`.
