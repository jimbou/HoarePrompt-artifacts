Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the size of the matrix for each test case.
2. It calculates the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix by using the formula `res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`, which is correct.
3. It prints the maximum sum and the number of operations (which is twice the size of the matrix) correctly.
4. It then prints the operations to achieve the maximum sum. The operations are of two types: Type 1 and Type 2. Type 1 operation assigns a permutation to a row, and Type 2 operation assigns a permutation to a column. The program correctly prints these operations in the required format.

The execution summary also confirms that the program behaves as expected. It reads the input, calculates the maximum sum, and prints the operations to achieve the maximum sum.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
