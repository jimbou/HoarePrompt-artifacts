Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of all numbers in an n x n matrix by performing a series of operations. The operations involve assigning a permutation of integers from 1 to n to a row or column of the matrix.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases and then iterating over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix (n) and initializes a matrix with all elements set to their respective row numbers (i.e., the first row contains 1s, the second row contains 2s, and so on).

3. It then calculates the maximum sum that can be achieved by summing up the products of each row number and the number of elements in that row multiplied by 2 plus 1. This is done using the formula: `res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`.

4. After calculating the maximum sum, the program prints the sum and the number of operations required to achieve this sum, which is 2n.

5. The program then generates the operations required to achieve the maximum sum. It does this by printing two operations for each row of the matrix: one for assigning a permutation to the row and another for assigning a permutation to the column.

6. The permutations assigned to the rows and columns are simply the numbers from 1 to n in ascending order.

Now, let's analyze the correctness of the program:

* The program correctly calculates the maximum sum that can be achieved by summing up the products of each row number and the number of elements in that row multiplied by 2 plus 1.

* The program correctly generates the operations required to achieve the maximum sum. By assigning the permutations to the rows and columns in ascending order, the program ensures that the maximum sum is achieved.

* The program correctly prints the number of operations required to achieve the maximum sum, which is 2n.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and the program's logic, it can be concluded that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
