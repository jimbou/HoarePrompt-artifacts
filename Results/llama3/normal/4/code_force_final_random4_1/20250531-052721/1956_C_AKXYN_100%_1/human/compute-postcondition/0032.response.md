Output State: **`n` is a positive integer that is at least 1, `i` is 1, `mat` is a 2D list with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains numbers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 1 + (1 + 1) * (2 * 1 + 1), `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to 1 + (1 + 1) * (2 * 1 + 1), which is equal to 1 + 2 * 3 = 1 + 6 = 7. The other variables remain unchanged.
