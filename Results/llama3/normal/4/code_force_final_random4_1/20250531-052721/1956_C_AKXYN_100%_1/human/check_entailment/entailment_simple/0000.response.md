Reasoning: The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of all numbers in an n x n matrix by performing two types of operations: Type 1 operation (choosing an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, ..., p_n of integers from 1 to n, and assigning a_{i, j} := p_j for all 1 <= j <= n simultaneously) and Type 2 operation (choosing an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, ..., p_n of integers from 1 to n, and assigning a_{j, i} := p_j for all 1 <= j <= n simultaneously). The program correctly calculates the maximum sum of all numbers in the matrix and provides a solution with no more than 2n operations.

The program first initializes a 2D list `mat` with `n` rows and `n` columns, where each row contains numbers from 1 to `n`. It then calculates the maximum sum `res` by summing up the products of `(i + 1)` and `(2 * i + 1)` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`. The program then prints the maximum sum `res` and the number of operations `n << 1`.

The program then generates the operations to achieve the maximum sum. It first prints the Type 1 operation for each row `i` from `n` to 1, followed by the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive). It then prints the Type 2 operation for each column `i` from `n` to 1, followed by the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

The program correctly generates the operations to achieve the maximum sum, and the number of operations does not exceed 2n.

Correctness: **True**
