This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains a single integer n representing the size of a matrix. It then calculates the sum of the products of consecutive integers from 1 to n and prints this sum along with twice the value of n. Additionally, it prints a series of strings and numbers in a specific pattern, where the strings are in the format '1 %d' and '2 %d' and the numbers range from 1 to n. The function repeats this process for each test case and does not return any value.
