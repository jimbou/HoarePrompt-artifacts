The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than or equal to `n-1`. For the loop to execute again `i` is decreased by 1 so `i` is `n-2` and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than or equal to `n-2`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer that must be greater than or equal to `n-2`, `i` is `n-2`, `mat` is a 2D list with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains numbers from 1 to `n`, `res` is `n*(n+1)*(2n+1)/3 - n*(n+1)`, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, and this is printed: '2' followed by the value of `i` which is `n-1`, and the numbers from 1 to `n` which are the first `n` positive integers**
