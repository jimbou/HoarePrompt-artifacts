The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` must be decreased by 1 so `i` is `n` - 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 0.
State: **`n` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `i` is `n` - 1, mat is a 2D list with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains numbers from 1 to `n`, res is the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to `n` - 1, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and this is printed: the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to `n` - 1 which is equal to res, and the number 2 multiplied by `n` which is equal to `n` << 1, and the string '1 %d' % i, and the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) are being printed, and the string '2 %d' % i is printed where i is equal to `n`, and the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) are being printed**
