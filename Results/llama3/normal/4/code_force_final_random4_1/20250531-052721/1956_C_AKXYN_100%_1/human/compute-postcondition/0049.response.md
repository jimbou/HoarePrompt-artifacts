The code prints a formatted string containing the number 1, the value of `i` which is equal to `n - 2`, and the numbers from 1 to `n` which is equal to `range(1, n + 1)`. Where `n` is a positive integer that must be greater than 1, `i` is `n - 2`, and `range(1, n + 1)` is a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`.
Output: **1 [n - 2] 1 2 3 4 5 ... [n] (where n is a positive integer greater than 1 and [n - 2] is the value of i)**
