You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 <= t <= 500). Each test case contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 500) — the size of the matrix a.
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        mat = [list(range(1, n + 1)) for i in range(n)]
        
        res = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)
        
        print(res, n << 1)
        
        for i in range(n, 0, -1):
            print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
            print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `mat` is a 2D list with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains numbers from 1 to `n`, `res` is the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `_` is equal to the number of test cases, `stdin` is empty, and this is printed: the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from 0 to `n-1` which is equal to `res`, and the number 2 multiplied by `n` which is equal to `n << 1`, and the string '1 %d' % i, and the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) are being printed, and the string '2 %d' % i is printed where `i` is equal to `n`, and the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) are being printed, and the string '1 %d' % i is printed where `i` is equal to `n - 1`, and the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) are being printed, and the string '2 %d' % i is printed where `i` is equal to `n - 1`, and the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) are being printed, and the string '1 %d' % i is printed where `i` is equal to `n - 2`, and the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) are being printed, and the string '2 %d' % i is printed where `i` is equal to `n - 2`, and the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) are being printed, and so on until `i` is equal to 1, and the string '1 %d' % i is printed where `i` is equal to 1, and the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) are being printed, and the string '2 %d' % i is printed where `i` is equal to 1, and the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) are being printed.

Return Postconditions: `n` is a positive integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `mat` is a 2D list with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains numbers from 1 to `n`, `res` is the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `_` is equal to the number of test cases, `stdin` is empty, and this is printed: the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from 0 to `n-1` which is equal to `res`, and the number 2 multiplied by `n` which is equal to `n << 1`, and the string '1 %d' % i, and the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) are being printed, and the string '2 %d' % i is printed where `i` is equal to `n`, and the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) are being printed, and the string '1 %d' % i is printed where `i` is equal to `n - 1`, and the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) are being printed, and the string '2 %d' % i is printed where `i` is equal to `n - 1`, and the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) are being printed, and the string '1 %d' % i is printed where `i` is equal to `n - 2`, and the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) are being printed, and the string '2 %d' % i is printed where `i` is equal to `n - 2`, and the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) are being printed, and so on until `i` is equal to 1, and the string '1 %d' % i is printed where `i` is equal to 1, and the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) are being printed, and the string '2 %d' % i is printed where `i` is equal to 1, and the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) are being printed.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
