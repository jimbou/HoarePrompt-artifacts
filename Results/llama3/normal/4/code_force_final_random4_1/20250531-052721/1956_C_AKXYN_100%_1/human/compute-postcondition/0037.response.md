Output: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n-1`, `mat` is a 2D list with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains numbers from 1 to `n`, `res` is the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, and this is printed: the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from 0 to `n-1` which is equal to `res` and the value of `n` shifted left by 1 bit which is equal to `n * 2`**
