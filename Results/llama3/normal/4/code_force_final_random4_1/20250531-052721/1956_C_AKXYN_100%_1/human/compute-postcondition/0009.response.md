The code prints the value of `res` and the result of the expression `n << 1`.

`res` is calculated as `n*(n+1)*(2n+1)/3`, which is the formula for the sum of the first `n` positive integers cubed.

`n << 1` is a bitwise left shift operation, which is equivalent to multiplying `n` by 2.

So, the output will be the value of `res` (the sum of the first `n` positive integers cubed) and twice the value of `n`.

Output: **n*(n+1)*(2n+1)/3, 2n (where n is a positive integer)**
