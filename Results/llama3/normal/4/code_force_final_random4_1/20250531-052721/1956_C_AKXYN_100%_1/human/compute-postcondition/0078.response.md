The code prints the string '2 %d' % i where i is equal to n - 2, and the numbers from 1 to n (inclusive) are being printed. Since i is equal to n - 2, the string '2 %d' % i is equivalent to '2 %d' % (n - 2). The numbers from 1 to n (inclusive) are being printed because the range function generates numbers from 1 to n (inclusive) and the * operator unpacks these numbers as separate arguments to the print function.

Output: **'2 %d' % (n - 2), 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100 (where n is equal to 100)**
