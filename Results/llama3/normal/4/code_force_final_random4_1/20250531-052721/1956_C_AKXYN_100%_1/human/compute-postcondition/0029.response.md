The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is a positive integer and i is 0, which ensures that the loop will execute. So, the state needs to be adjusted to `i` is 0 and `n` is at least 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer that is at least 1, `i` is 0, `mat` is a 2D list with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains numbers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 0, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one**
