The value of `res` is updated by adding the product of `(i + 1)` and `(2 * i + 1)`. Given that `i` is 2, the expression `(i + 1)` evaluates to 3 and `(2 * i + 1)` evaluates to 5. Therefore, the product of these two expressions is 15. Adding this product to the initial value of `res`, which is 7, results in a new value of `res` equal to 22.

The values of the other variables are not affected by this code snippet. `n` remains a positive integer greater than 1, `i` remains 2, `mat` remains a 2D list with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains numbers from 1 to `n`, and `_` remains 0. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `mat` is a 2D list with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains numbers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 22, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one.**
