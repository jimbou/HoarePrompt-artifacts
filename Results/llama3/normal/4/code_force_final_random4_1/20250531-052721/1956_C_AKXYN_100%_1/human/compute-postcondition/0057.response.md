Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `mat` is a 2D list with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains numbers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 1, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, and this is printed: the number 2 followed by the value of `i` which is equal to 0, and the numbers from 1 to `n` which is equal to `range(1, n + 1)`**

The value of `res` is updated by adding the product of `(i + 1)` and `(2 * i + 1)`, where `i` is 0. Therefore, `res` becomes 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
