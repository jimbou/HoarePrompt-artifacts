Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n-1`, `mat` is a 2D list with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains numbers from 1 to `n`, `res` is the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is:

The loop has finished executing, and the variable `i` has reached its final value of `n-1`. The variable `res` now holds the sum of the products of `(i + 1)` and `(2 * i + 1)` for all values of `i` from 0 to `n-1`. The other variables, `mat`, `_`, and `stdin`, remain unchanged.
