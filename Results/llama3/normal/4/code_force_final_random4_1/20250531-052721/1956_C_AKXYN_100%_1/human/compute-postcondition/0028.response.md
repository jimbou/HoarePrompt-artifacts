Output State: **n is a positive integer, i is 0, mat is a 2D list with n rows and n columns where each row contains numbers from 1 to n, res is 0, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

The code snippet provided reads an integer value from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `n`. It then creates a 2D list `mat` with `n` rows and `n` columns, where each row contains numbers from 1 to `n`. The variable `res` is initialized to 0. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 0, and the value of `_` remains unchanged at 1. The standard input `stdin` now contains one less test case.
