The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer that must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `mat` is a 2D list with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains numbers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 7, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, and this is printed: the number 2 followed by the value of `i` which is equal to 2, and the numbers from 1 to `n` which is equal to `range(1, n + 1)`**
