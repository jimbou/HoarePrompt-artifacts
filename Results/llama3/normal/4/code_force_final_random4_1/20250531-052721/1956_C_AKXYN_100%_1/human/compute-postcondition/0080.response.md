Output State: **n is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, i is 0, mat is a 2D list with n rows and n columns where each row contains numbers from 1 to n, res is the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to n - 1, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and this is printed: the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to n - 1 which is equal to res, and the number 2 multiplied by n which is equal to n << 1, and the string '1 %d' % i, and the numbers from 1 to n (inclusive) are being printed, and the string '2 %d' % i is printed where i is equal to n, and the numbers from 1 to n (inclusive) are being printed, and the string '1 %d' % i is printed where i is equal to n - 1, and the numbers from 1 to n (inclusive) are being printed, and the string '2 %d' % i is printed where i is equal to n - 1, and the numbers from 1 to n (inclusive) are being printed, and the string '1 %d' % i is printed where i is equal to n - 2, and the numbers from 1 to n (inclusive) are being printed, and the string '2 %d' % i is printed where i is equal to n - 2, and the numbers from 1 to n (inclusive) are being printed, and so on until i is equal to 1, and the string '1 %d' % i is printed where i is equal to 1, and the numbers from 1 to n (inclusive) are being printed, and the string '2 %d' % i is printed where i is equal to 1, and the numbers from 1 to n (inclusive) are being printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `i` has reached 0, and all the print statements inside the loop have been executed for all values of `i` from `n` down to 1. The other variables in the precondition remain unchanged.
