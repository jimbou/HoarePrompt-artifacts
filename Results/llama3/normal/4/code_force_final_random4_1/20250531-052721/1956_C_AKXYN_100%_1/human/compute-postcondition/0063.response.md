The code prints the value of `res` which is the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from `0` to `n - 1`, and the value of `n << 1` which is equivalent to `n * 2`.

Since `i` is equal to `n - 1`, the sum `res` can be calculated as the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from `0` to `n - 1`. This sum represents the sum of the products of consecutive integers from `1` to `n` and their corresponding odd numbers.

The value of `n << 1` is simply twice the value of `n`.

Output: **the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to n - 1, 2n (where n is the value of n)**
