Output State: **`n` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `i` is 2, `mat` is a 2D list with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains numbers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 1 + (1 + 1) * (2 * 1 + 1) + (2 + 1) * (2 * 2 + 1), `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains the same, a positive integer that is at least 2. The value of `i` remains the same, which is 2. The 2D list `mat` also remains the same, with `n` rows and `n` columns, where each row contains numbers from 1 to `n`. The value of `res` is updated by adding `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` to its initial value, which results in `1 + (1 + 1) * (2 * 1 + 1) + (2 + 1) * (2 * 2 + 1)`. The value of `_` remains the same, which is 1. The number of test cases in `stdin` is reduced by one.
