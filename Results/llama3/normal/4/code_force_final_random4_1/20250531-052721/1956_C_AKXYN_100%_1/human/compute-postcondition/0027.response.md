To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects within it.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The objects in the loop head are `_` and `input()`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 0, and `input()` contains multiple test cases minus one.

For the loop to execute again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `input()` needs to contain one less test case.

State: **`n` is a positive integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `mat` is a 2D list with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains numbers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 0, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, and this is printed: '2' followed by the value of `i` which is 1, and the numbers from 1 to `n` which are the first `n` positive integers.**
