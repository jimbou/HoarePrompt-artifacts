Output State: **`n` is a positive integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `mat` is a 2D list with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains numbers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 0, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, and this is printed: '2' followed by the value of `i` which is 1, and the numbers from 1 to `n` which are the first `n` positive integers.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing and the value of `i` has reached 0. The value of `n` is still a positive integer, and the 2D list `mat` remains unchanged. The variable `res` has been decremented by the sum of the first `n` positive integers in each iteration, and its final value is 0. The variable `_` is still 0, and the input from `stdin` is still multiple test cases minus one. The output printed is the string '2' followed by the value of `i` (which is 1) and the numbers from 1 to `n`, which are the first `n` positive integers.
