The code prints a string that starts with '2' followed by the value of `i`, which is equal to `n - 1`. Then it prints the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), which is equal to `range(1, n + 1)`. Since `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, the value of `i` will always be a positive integer less than `n`. The numbers printed after `i` will be a sequence of consecutive integers starting from 1 and ending at `n`.

Output: **2[n - 1], 1, 2, 3, ..., n (where n is a positive integer greater than 0)**
