The only variable in the loop head is the variable `_` and `times`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `times`. If `times` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `times` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), which ensures that the loop will execute, so it does not need to be adjusted. However, `_` is not initialized before the loop starts, so it needs to be adjusted to be 0, which is the initial value of the loop variable in a for loop.

State: **`times` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `check` is 2147483647, stdin contains t lines of input where t is the value of times, each line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), followed by t lines, each containing n space-separated integers a_1, ..., a_n (0 <= a_j < 2^31), `_` is 0**
