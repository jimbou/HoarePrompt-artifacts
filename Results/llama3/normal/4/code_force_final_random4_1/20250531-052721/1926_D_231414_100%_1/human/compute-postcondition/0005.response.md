Postcondition: **`times` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `check` is 2^31 - 1, `stdin` contains t-1 lines of input where t is the value of `times`, each line contains a single integer `n` (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), followed by t-1 lines, each containing `n` space-separated integers `a_1`, ..., `a_n` (0 <= a_j < 2^31), `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `data` is a list of integers `a_1`, ..., `a_n` (0 <= a_j < 2^31) that must have at least 1 element, `dic` is a dictionary that contains at least one key which is the current value of `i`, `ans` is 0, the current value of `i` is the first element in the list `data`, and the current value of `s` is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the current value of `i` and `check`.**
