Output State: **times is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), check is 2147483647, stdin contains t lines of input where t is the value of times, each line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), followed by t lines, each containing n space-separated integers a_1, ..., a_n (0 <= a_j < 2^31).**

The code reads the first line from stdin and assigns its integer value to the variable `times`. The value of `times` is between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), as specified in the initial state. The second line assigns the value of `2 ** 31 - 1` to the variable `check`, which is equal to 2147483647. The remaining lines in stdin are not affected by the code and still contain the same input as specified in the initial state.
