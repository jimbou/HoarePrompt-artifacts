Output State: **times is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), check is 2^31 - 1, stdin contains t-1 lines of input where t is the value of times, each line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), followed by t-1 lines, each containing n space-separated integers a_1, ..., a_n (0 <= a_j < 2^31), _ is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), data is a list of integers a_1, ..., a_n (0 <= a_j < 2^31), dic is an empty dictionary, ans is 0**

The code executes as follows: 

- The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`. Since `times` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), and stdin contains `times` lines of input, `n` becomes an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive). Stdin now contains `times - 1` lines of input.

- The second line reads a list of integers from stdin and assigns it to `data`. Since each line contains `n` space-separated integers `a_1, ..., a_n` (0 <= `a_j` < 2^31), `data` becomes a list of integers `a_1, ..., a_n` (0 <= `a_j` < 2^31). Stdin now contains `times - 1` lines of input.

- The third line creates an empty dictionary and assigns it to `dic`. 

- The fourth line assigns 0 to `ans`.

- The fifth line assigns 2^31 - 1 to `check`.
