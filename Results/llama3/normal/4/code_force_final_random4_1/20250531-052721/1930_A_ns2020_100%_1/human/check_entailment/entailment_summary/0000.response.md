Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and the `2n` integers themselves, storing them in the list `A`.
3.  The program sorts the list `A` in ascending order, which is a crucial step in finding the maximum final score.
4.  By summing every other integer starting from the first one (i.e., `A[::2]`), the program effectively calculates the maximum final score that can be achieved by performing the `n` moves optimally.
5.  The program prints the calculated maximum final score for each test case.

The execution summary accurately describes the program's behavior, and the provided example inputs and outputs match the expected results.

Correctness: **True**
