Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 4998 (inclusive), stdin contains t test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), A is a sorted list of 2n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^7), and the sum of every other element in the list A starting from the first element is being printed**

The code decrements the value of t by 1, so the new value of t is between 0 and 4998 (inclusive). The values of the other variables, n and A, remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t test cases.
