Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by 2n integers. It sorts the integers in ascending order and prints the sum of every other integer starting from the first one. The function continues this process until all test cases have been processed, at which point the standard input is empty and the function terminates.**
