The value of `t` is decremented by 1. The value of `t` was between 1 and 5000 (inclusive), so the new value of `t` is between 0 and 4999 (inclusive). The values of the other variables are not affected. stdin contains t-1 test cases, so now stdin contains t test cases. n is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), and A is a sorted list of 2n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^7), and the sum of every other element in the list A starting from the first element is being printed.
Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 4999 (inclusive), stdin contains t test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `A` is a sorted list of 2n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^7), and the sum of every other element in the list A starting from the first element is being printed.**
