Let's analyze the code step by step.

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`.

In the initial state, `stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 5000) followed by `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 50) followed by 2n integers `a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}` (1 <= a_i <= 10^7).

When the code `t = int(input())` is executed, the first integer `t` is read from the standard input and assigned to the variable `t`. The remaining input in `stdin` is now `t` test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` followed by 2n integers `a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5000 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t` test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 50) followed by 2n integers `a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}` (1 <= a_i <= 10^7).**
