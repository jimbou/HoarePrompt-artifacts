To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition of the loop, which is simply `while t:`. This implies the loop will continue as long as `t` is not zero.

Given that `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000 (inclusive), we can see that `t` is already in a state that allows the loop to execute at least once because it is guaranteed to be greater than zero.

Therefore, no adjustments to the state of `t` or any other variables are necessary for the loop to execute the first time. The state right before the loop is already conducive to the loop's execution.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5000 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t` test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 50) followed by 2n integers `a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}` (1 <= a_i <= 10^7)**
