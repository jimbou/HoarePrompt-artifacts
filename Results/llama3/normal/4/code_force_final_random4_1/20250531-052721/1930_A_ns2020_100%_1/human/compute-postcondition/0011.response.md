The variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t.  If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is an integer between 0 and 4998 (inclusive), So for the loop to be executed one more time t must be greater than 0.
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 4998 (inclusive), stdin contains t test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), A is a sorted list of 2n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^7), and the sum of every other element in the list A starting from the first element is being printed**
