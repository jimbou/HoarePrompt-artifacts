Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum final score that can be achieved by performing n moves on 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. The move involves choosing two integers x and y, adding the minimum of x and y to the score, and erasing x and y from the whiteboard.

The given program defines a function `func()` that reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and the list of integers `A`. It sorts the list `A` in ascending order and then prints the sum of every other element in the sorted list, starting from the first element (index 0).

The key insight here is that by sorting the list and summing every other element, the program is effectively pairing the smallest numbers together and adding the smaller of each pair to the score. This is because the smallest numbers will be at the beginning of the sorted list, and by summing every other element, we are pairing the smallest number with the next smallest number, the third smallest number with the fourth smallest number, and so on.

This approach ensures that the minimum of each pair is added to the score, which is the optimal strategy to maximize the final score.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
