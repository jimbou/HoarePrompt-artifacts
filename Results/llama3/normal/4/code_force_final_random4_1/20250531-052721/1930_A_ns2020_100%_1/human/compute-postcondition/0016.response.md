Output State: **t is 0, stdin is empty, n is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), A is a sorted list of 2n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^7), and the sum of every other element in the list A starting from the first element has been printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the variable `t` will be 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The standard input (`stdin`) will be empty, as all test cases have been read and processed. The variable `n` will still be an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), representing the number of integers in the last test case. The list `A` will be a sorted list of `2n` integers, where `n` is the number of integers in the last test case, and each integer is between 1 and 10^7 (inclusive). Finally, the sum of every other element in the list `A` starting from the first element will have been printed for all test cases.
