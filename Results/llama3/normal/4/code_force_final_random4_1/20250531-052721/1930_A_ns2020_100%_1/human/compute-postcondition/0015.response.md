Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 4997 (inclusive), stdin contains t test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), A is a sorted list of 2n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^7), and the sum of every other element in the list A starting from the first element is being printed**

In this output state, the value of t has been decremented by 1, so it is now between 0 and 4997 (inclusive). The number of test cases in stdin has also been decremented by 1, so it now contains t test cases. The values of n and A remain unchanged.
