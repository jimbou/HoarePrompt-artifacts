Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 4998 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), A is a sorted list of 2n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^7)**

The code first reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to n. Since n was already an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), its value remains within this range. The second line reads a list of 2n integers from stdin, where each integer is between 1 and 10^7 (inclusive), and assigns it to A. The third line sorts the list A in ascending order. 

The sum of every other element in the list A starting from the first element is not affected by the code, as it only reads and sorts the list, but does not perform any calculations or modifications on the elements. 

The only change is that stdin now contains t-1 test cases, as one test case has been read and processed.
