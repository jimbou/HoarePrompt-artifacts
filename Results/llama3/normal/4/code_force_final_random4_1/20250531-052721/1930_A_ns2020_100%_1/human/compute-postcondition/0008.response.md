Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

Initial State:

* `t` is an integer between 1 and 4999 (inclusive)
* `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases (this information is not directly relevant to the print statement)
* `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive)
* `A` is a sorted list of `2n` integers, where each integer is between 1 and 10^7 (inclusive)

Code Snippet:
```python
print(sum(A[::2]))
```
Here, we're using slicing to extract every other element from the list `A`, starting from the first element (index 0). The `::2` slice means "start at the beginning, go to the end, and step by 2".

Since `A` is a sorted list of `2n` integers, the slicing operation will extract the first, third, fifth, ..., (2n-1)th elements of the list.

The `sum` function will then add up these extracted elements.

Now, let's describe the output:

The code prints the sum of every other element in the sorted list `A`, starting from the first element. Since `A` contains `2n` integers, the sum will be the sum of `n` integers, where each integer is between 1 and 10^7 (inclusive).

Output: **the sum of every other element in the sorted list A, starting from the first element (where each element is between 1 and 10^7)**
