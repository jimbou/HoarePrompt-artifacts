The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case contains three lines, the first line of the first test case is accepted as input and converted to an integer. The value of `t` is now equal to the number of test cases.

Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three lines. The first line of the first test case has been read, and the remaining lines of the first test case and all other test cases are still in the stdin.**
