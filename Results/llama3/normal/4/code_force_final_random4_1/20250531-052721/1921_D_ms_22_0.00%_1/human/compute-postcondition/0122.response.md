Postcondition: **t is 0, n is greater than 0, m is an integer, a is a list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, max_heap is a list of n-3 tuples and is not empty, ans is updated based on the previous iteration and the smallest tuple from the original max_heap list, item is the smallest tuple from the original max_heap list. If item[2] is less than tp1 or greater than tp2, then if diff1 is greater than diff2, ans is updated by adding the absolute difference between the second element of the smallest tuple from the original max_heap list and the tp1th element of b, and tp1 is incremented by 1. Otherwise, diff2 is updated to be the absolute difference between the second element of the smallest tuple from the original max_heap list and the (tp2-1)th element of b, and tp2 is decremented by 1. If item[2] is not less than tp1 and not greater than tp2, then ans is increased by the negation of the first element of item. If item[2] equals tp1, then tp1 is increased by 1. Otherwise, tp2 is decreased by 1.**
