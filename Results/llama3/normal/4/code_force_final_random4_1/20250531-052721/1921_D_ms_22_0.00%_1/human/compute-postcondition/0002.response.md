The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t. If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, t is the number of test cases, which is not guaranteed to be greater than 0. So, for the loop to execute the first time, t must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three lines. The first line of the first test case has been read, and the remaining lines of the first test case and all other test cases are still in the stdin.**
