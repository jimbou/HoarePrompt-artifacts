Output State: **t is 0, n is greater than 0, m is an integer, a is a list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, max_heap is a list of n-1 tuples, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, item is the smallest tuple from the original max_heap, diff1 is the absolute difference between item[1] and b[tp1], diff2 is the absolute difference between item[1] and b[tp2], stdin contains no input.**

The code snippet calculates the absolute differences between the second element of the smallest tuple in the original max_heap and the first and last elements of the sorted list b. The values of diff1 and diff2 are determined based on the current values of item, b, tp1, and tp2. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
