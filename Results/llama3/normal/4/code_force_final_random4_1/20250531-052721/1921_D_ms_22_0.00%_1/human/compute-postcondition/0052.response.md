Output State: **t is an integer, n is an integer, m is an integer, a is an empty list, b is a sorted list of m integers, max_heap is a non-empty list containing at least one tuple with the minimum absolute differences between each element in a and either the first or last element in b, item is a tuple with the minimum absolute difference between an element in a and either the first or last element in b that was previously at the top of max_heap, diff1 is the absolute difference between the second element of item and the first element of b, and diff2 is the absolute difference between the second element of item and the last element of b.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `max_heap`, and `item` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The code only introduces two new variables, `diff1` and `diff2`, which are calculated based on the values of `item` and `b`. The absolute differences between the second element of `item` and the first and last elements of `b` are assigned to `diff1` and `diff2`, respectively.
