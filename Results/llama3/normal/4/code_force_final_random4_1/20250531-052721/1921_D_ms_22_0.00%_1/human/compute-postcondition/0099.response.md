Postcondition: **`t` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers, `max_heap` is a list of `n-1` tuples, `ans` is `-item[0]`, `item` is the smallest tuple from the original `max_heap`. If the third element of `item` is equal to `tp1`, then `tp1` is 1 and the second element of `item` is greater than or equal to `tp1` and less than or equal to `m - 1`. Otherwise, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 2`, and the second element of `item` is greater than or equal to `tp1` and less than or equal to `tp2`.**
