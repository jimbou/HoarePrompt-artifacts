Postcondition: **t is either 0 or 1, n is greater than 0, m is an integer, a is an empty list, b is a sorted list of m integers, max_heap is a non-empty list containing either n - 2 or n - 3 tuples with the minimum absolute differences between each element in a and either the first or last element in b, item is a tuple with the minimum absolute difference between an element in a and either the first or last element in b, diff1 is the absolute difference between item[1] and the first element in b, diff2 is the absolute difference between item[1] and the last element in b. If diff1 is greater than diff2, then t is 1 and ans is increased by diff1. Otherwise, t is 0, max_heap contains n - 3 tuples, tp2 is one less than its original value, and ans is increased by diff2.**
