To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`. The loop will execute if `a` has at least one element. Since `a` is a list of `n` integers, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 element, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers, `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `i` is the first element in `a`**
