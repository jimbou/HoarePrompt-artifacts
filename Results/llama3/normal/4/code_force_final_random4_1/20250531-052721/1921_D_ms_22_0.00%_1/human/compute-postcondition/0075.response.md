Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is the second integer in the list `a`, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first integer in the list `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last integer in the list `b`, `max_heap` contains a tuple with the value `(-diff1, i, 0)`, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `i`, `b`, `diff1`, and `diff2` remain unchanged. The `max_heap` has been updated to contain a tuple with the value `(-diff1, i, 0)`, which is a combination of the absolute difference between `i` and the first integer in the list `b`, the value of `i`, and the integer 0. The stdin remains empty.
