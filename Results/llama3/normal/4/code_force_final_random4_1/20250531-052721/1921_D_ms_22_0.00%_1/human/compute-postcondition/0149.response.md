Output State: **t is 0, n is greater than 0, m is an integer, a is a list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, max_heap is a list containing n-1 tuples, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, i is the last integer in the list, diff1 is the absolute difference between the largest tuple in max_heap and the first integer in list b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the largest tuple in max_heap and the last integer in list b, item is the largest tuple in max_heap and stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the values of `diff1` and `diff2` have been updated based on the largest tuple in `max_heap` and the first and last integers in the sorted list `b`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and properties as specified in the precondition.
