Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, max_heap is an empty list, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, stdin contains no input
Code of the loop:
for i in a:
    diff1 = abs(i - b[0])
    diff2 = abs(i - b[m - 1])
    if diff1 > diff2:
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff1, i, 0))
    else:
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff2, i, m - 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 integer, i is the first integer in the list a, b is a sorted list of m integers, stdin contains no input. If the absolute difference between i and the first integer in the list b is greater than the absolute difference between i and the last integer in the list b, then max_heap is a list containing one tuple (-diff1, i, 0), tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, and the current value of diff1 is greater than diff2. Otherwise, max_heap is a list containing one tuple (-diff2, i, m - 1), tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of n integers that must have at least 2 integers, i is the second integer in the list a, b is a sorted list of m integers, stdin contains no input, diff1 is the absolute difference between i and the first integer in the list b, diff2 is the absolute difference between i and the last integer in the list b. If diff1 is greater than diff2, max_heap contains a tuple with the value (-diff1, i, 0). Otherwise, max_heap contains a tuple with the negative value of diff2, i, and m - 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of n integers that must have at least 3 integers, i is the third integer in the list a, b is a sorted list of m integers, stdin contains no input, diff1 is the absolute difference between i and the first integer in the list b, diff2 is the absolute difference between i and the last integer in the list b. If diff1 is greater than diff2, max_heap contains a tuple with the value (-diff1, i, 0). Otherwise, max_heap contains a tuple with the negative value of diff2, i, and m - 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
