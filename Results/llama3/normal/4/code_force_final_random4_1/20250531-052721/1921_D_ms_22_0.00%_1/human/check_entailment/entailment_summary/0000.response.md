Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It uses a max heap to efficiently find the maximum difference between each element in array `a` and its closest element in the sorted array `b`. The program maintains two pointers, `tp1` and `tp2`, to keep track of the current position in the sorted array `b` and to ensure that each element in `b` is used at most once.

The program correctly calculates the sum of the absolute differences between each element in `a` and its closest element in `b`, and prints this sum for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
