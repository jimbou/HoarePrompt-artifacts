Output State: **t is 0, n is greater than 0, m is an integer, a is a list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, max_heap is a list of n-3 tuples and is not empty, ans is updated based on the previous iteration and the smallest tuple from the original max_heap list, item is the smallest tuple from the original max_heap list, diff1 is the absolute difference between the second element of the smallest tuple from the original max_heap list and the tp1th element of b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the second element of the smallest tuple from the original max_heap list and the (tp2-1)th element of b, tp2 is tp2-1.**

In this output state, all variables from the initial state remain unchanged except for `tp2` and `ans`. The value of `tp2` is decremented by 1, and the value of `ans` is incremented by the value of `diff2`, which is the absolute difference between the second element of the smallest tuple from the original `max_heap` list and the `tp2th` element of `b`.
