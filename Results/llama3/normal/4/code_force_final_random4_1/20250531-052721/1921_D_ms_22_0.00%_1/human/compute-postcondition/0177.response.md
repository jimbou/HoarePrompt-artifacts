Output State: **t is 0, n is greater than 0, m is an integer, a is a list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, max_heap is not empty and its size is greater than 0 but is reduced by 1, i is the last integer in the list, diff1 is the absolute difference between the first element of the largest tuple that was in max_heap and the integer at index tp1 in list b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the first element of the largest tuple that was in max_heap and the integer at index tp2 in list b, item is the largest tuple that was in max_heap but is now removed, tp1 is either 1, 2, or 3, tp2 is either 0, 1, m - 1, m - 2, or m - 3, and ans is the original value of ans plus the absolute difference between the largest tuple that was in max_heap and the integer at index tp1 in list b.**

The code increments `tp1` by 1, making it either 1, 2, or 3, and adds `diff1` to `ans`, increasing its value by the absolute difference between the largest tuple that was in `max_heap` and the integer at index `tp1` in list `b`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
