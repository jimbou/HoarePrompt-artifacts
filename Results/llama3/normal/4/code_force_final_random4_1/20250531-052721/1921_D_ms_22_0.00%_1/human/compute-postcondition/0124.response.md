The `print(ans)` statement will print the sum of the absolute differences between each element in list `a` and its closest element in list `b`.

Since the exact values of the elements in lists `a` and `b` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated sum of absolute differences.

Output: **sum of absolute differences between each element in list a and its closest element in list b**
