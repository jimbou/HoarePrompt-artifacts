Postcondition: ***`t` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers, `max_heap` is a list of `n-1` tuples, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `item` is the smallest tuple from the original `max_heap`, `stdin` contains no input. The current value of `item[2]` is either less than 0 or greater than `m - 1`***
