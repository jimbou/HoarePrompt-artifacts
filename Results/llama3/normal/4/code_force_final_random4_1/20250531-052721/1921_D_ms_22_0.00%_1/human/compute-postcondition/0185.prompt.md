Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is 0, n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, max_heap is a list containing n tuples, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, i is the last integer in the list, diff1 is the absolute difference between the last integer in list a and the first integer in list b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the last integer in list a and the last integer in list b, stdin contains no input. The number of tuples in max_heap is increased by 1 for each integer in list a, where each tuple contains the negative absolute difference between the integer and either the first or last integer in list b, the integer itself, and either 0 or m - 1, depending on whether the absolute difference with the first integer is greater than the absolute difference with the last integer.
Code of the loop:
while max_heap:
    item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
    if item[2] < tp1 or item[2] > tp2:
        diff1 = abs(item[1] - b[tp1])
        diff2 = abs(item[1] - b[tp2])
        if diff1 > diff2:
            tp1 += 1
            ans += diff1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1
            ans += diff2
    else:
        ans += -item[0]
        if item[2] == tp1:
            tp1 += 1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers, `max_heap` is a list containing `n-1` tuples, `i` is the last integer in the list, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the last integer in list `a` and the first integer in list `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the last integer in list `a` and the last integer in list `b`, `item` is the largest tuple in `max_heap`, and stdin contains no input. If the absolute difference between the largest tuple in `max_heap` and the first integer in list `b` is greater than the absolute difference between the largest tuple in `max_heap` and the last integer in list `b`, then `tp1` is 1, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is greater than 0, and the absolute difference between the largest tuple in `max_heap` and the first integer in list `b` is less than or equal to the current value of `diff2`. If the third element of the largest tuple in `max_heap` equals `tp1`, then `tp1` is 1. Otherwise, `tp2` is `m - 2`. In both cases, `ans` is increased by the negation of the first element of the largest tuple in `max_heap`. If the absolute difference between the largest tuple in `max_heap` and the first integer in list `b` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the largest tuple in `max_heap` and the last integer in list `b`, then `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 2`, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the absolute difference between the largest tuple in `max_heap` and the last integer in list `b`, and the absolute difference between the largest tuple in `max_heap` and the first integer in list `b` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the largest tuple in `max_heap` and the second last integer in list `b`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *t is 0, n is greater than 0, m is an integer, a is a list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, max_heap is not empty and its size is reduced by 1, i is the last integer in the list, diff1 is the absolute difference between the first element of the largest tuple that was in max_heap and the integer at index tp1 in list b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the first element of the largest tuple that was in max_heap and the integer at index tp2 in list b, item is the largest tuple that was in max_heap but is now removed, tp1 and tp2 are either 0, 1, m - 1, or m - 2, and ans is the original value of ans plus the absolute difference between the largest tuple that was in max_heap and either the last integer in list b or the integer at index tp1 or tp2 in list b. If the third element of the largest tuple that was in max_heap equals tp1, then tp1 is either 1 or 2. Otherwise, tp2 is either m - 2 or m - 3. In both cases, ans is increased by the negation of the first element of the largest tuple that was in max_heap. If the absolute difference between the largest tuple that was in max_heap and the first integer in list b is greater than the absolute difference between the largest tuple that was in max_heap and the last integer in list b, then tp1 is either 1 or 2, tp2 is either m - 1 or m - 2, and the absolute difference between the largest tuple that was in max_heap and the first integer in list b is less than or equal to the current value of diff2. If the absolute difference between the largest tuple that was in max_heap and the first integer in list b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the largest tuple that was in max_heap and the last integer in list b, then tp1 is either 0 or 1, tp2 is either m - 2 or m - 3, ans is the original value of ans plus the absolute difference between the largest tuple that was in max_heap and the last integer in list b, and the absolute difference between the largest tuple that was in max_heap and the first integer in list b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the largest tuple that was in max_heap and the second last integer in list b. stdin contains no input.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`t` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers, `max_heap` is not empty and its size is greater than 0 but is reduced by 1, `i` is the last integer in the list, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the first element of the largest tuple that was in `max_heap` and the integer at index `tp1` in list `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the first element of the largest tuple that was in `max_heap` and the integer at index `tp2` in list `b`, `item` is the largest tuple that was in `max_heap` but is now removed, `tp1` and `tp2` are either 0, 1, 2, 3, `m - 1`, `m - 2`, or `m - 3`, and `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the absolute difference between the largest tuple that was in `max_heap` and either the last integer in list `b` or the integer at index `tp1` or `tp2` in list `b`. If the third element of the largest tuple that was in `max_heap` equals `tp1`, then `tp1` is either 1 or 2. Otherwise, `tp2` is either `m - 2` or `m - 3`. In both cases, `ans` is increased by the negation of the first element of the largest tuple that was in `max_heap`. If the absolute difference between the largest tuple that was in `max_heap` and the first integer in list `b` is greater than the absolute difference between the largest tuple that was in `max_heap` and the last integer in list `b`, then `tp1` is either 1 or 2, `tp2` is either `m - 1` or `m - 2`, and the absolute difference between the largest tuple that was in `max_heap` and the first integer in list `b` is less than or equal to the current value of `diff2`. If the absolute difference between the largest tuple that was in `max_heap` and the first integer in list `b` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the largest tuple that was in `max_heap` and the last integer in list `b`, then `tp1` is either 0 or 1, `tp2` is either `m - 3` or `m - 2`, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the absolute difference between the largest tuple that was in `max_heap` and the last integer in list `b`, and the absolute difference between the largest tuple that was in `max_heap` and the first integer in list `b` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the largest tuple that was in `max_heap` and the second last integer in list `b`. If `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, then `tp1` is either 1, 2, or 3, `tp2` is either 0, 1, `m - 1`, `m - 2`, or `m - 3`, and `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the absolute difference between the largest tuple that was in `max_heap` and the integer at index `tp1` in list `b`. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1, and `ans` is increased by `diff2`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
