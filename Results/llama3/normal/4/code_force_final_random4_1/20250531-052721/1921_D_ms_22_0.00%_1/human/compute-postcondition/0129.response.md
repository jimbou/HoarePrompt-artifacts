Output State: **t is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 integer, b is a sorted list of m integers, max_heap is an empty list, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, stdin contains no input, i is the first integer in the list, diff1 is the absolute difference between the first integer in list a and the first integer in list b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the first integer in list a and the last integer in list b**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `max_heap`, `tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`, and `stdin` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The code only introduces two new variables, `diff1` and `diff2`, which are calculated based on the first integer `i` in list `a` and the first and last integers in list `b`, respectively.
