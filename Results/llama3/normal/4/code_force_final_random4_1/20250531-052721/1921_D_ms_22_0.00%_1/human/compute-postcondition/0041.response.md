Output State: **t is 0, n is greater than 0, m is an integer, a is an empty list, b is a sorted list of m integers, max_heap is a non-empty list containing n - 2 tuples with the minimum absolute differences between each element in a and either the first or last element in b, item is a tuple with the minimum absolute difference between an element in a and either the first or last element in b, diff1 is the absolute difference between item[1] and the first element in b, diff2 is the absolute difference between item[1] and the last element in b.**

The code snippet calculates the absolute differences between the second element of the `item` tuple and the first and last elements of the sorted list `b`, and assigns these differences to `diff1` and `diff2`, respectively. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `max_heap`, and `item` remain unchanged.
