Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of n integers, `b` is a sorted list of m integers, `max_heap` is a list of n-2 tuples and is not empty, `ans` is updated based on the previous iteration and the smallest tuple from the original `max_heap` list, `item` is the smallest tuple from the original `max_heap` list**

The value of `ans` is updated by adding the negation of the first element of the smallest tuple from the original `max_heap` list. The values of the other variables are not affected.
