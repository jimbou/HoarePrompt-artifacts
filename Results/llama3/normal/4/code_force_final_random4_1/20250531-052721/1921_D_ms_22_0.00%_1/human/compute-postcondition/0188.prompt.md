Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three lines. The first line of the first test case has been read, and the remaining lines of the first test case and all other test cases are still in the stdin.
Code of the loop:
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b.sort()
    max_heap = []
    tp1 = 0
    tp2 = m - 1
    ans = 0
    for i in a:
        diff1 = abs(i - b[0])
        diff2 = abs(i - b[m - 1])
        if diff1 > diff2:
            heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff1, i, 0))
        else:
            heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff2, i, m - 1))
    while max_heap:
        item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
        if item[2] < tp1 or item[2] > tp2:
            diff1 = abs(item[1] - b[tp1])
            diff2 = abs(item[1] - b[tp2])
            if diff1 > diff2:
                tp1 += 1
                ans += diff1
            else:
                tp2 -= 1
                ans += diff2
        else:
            ans += -item[0]
            if item[2] == tp1:
                tp1 += 1
            else:
                tp2 -= 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is 0, n is 0, m is an integer, a is an empty list, b is a sorted list of m integers, max_heap is an empty list, tp1 is m, tp2 is -1, ans is the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each element in a and either the first or last element in b, and the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each element in a and either the first or last element in b which is ans is being printed
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is 0, n is greater than 0, m is an integer, a is a list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, max_heap is an empty list, tp1 is m, tp2 is -1, ans is the sum of the absolute differences between each element in a and its closest element in b, and the sum of the absolute differences between each element in a and its closest element in b is printed
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: tp1 is m - 1, tp2 is 0, ans is the sum of the absolute differences between each integer in list a and the closest integer in list b, max_heap is an empty list, and the sum of the absolute differences between each integer in list a and the closest integer in list b which is ans is being printed


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
