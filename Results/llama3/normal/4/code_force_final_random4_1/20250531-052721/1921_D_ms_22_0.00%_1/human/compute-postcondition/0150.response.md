Postcondition: **t is 0, n is greater than 0, m is an integer, a is a list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, max_heap is a list containing n-1 tuples, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, i is the last integer in the list, the current value of diff1 is greater than the current value of diff2, where diff1 is the absolute difference between the largest tuple in max_heap and the first integer in list b, and diff2 is the absolute difference between the largest tuple in max_heap and the last integer in list b, item is the largest tuple in max_heap and stdin contains no input.**
