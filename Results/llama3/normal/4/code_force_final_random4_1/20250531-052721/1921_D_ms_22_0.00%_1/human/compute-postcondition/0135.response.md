To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which in this case is only the variable `i` and the list `a`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more elements in the list `a`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the first integer in the list `a`. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be the next integer in the list `a`, and the list `a` should have at least one more integer.

State: **t is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of n integers that must have at least 2 integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, max_heap is a list containing one tuple, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, i is the second integer in the list, stdin contains no input. If the absolute difference between the second integer in list a and the first integer in list b (diff1) is greater than the absolute difference between the second integer in list a and the last integer in list b (diff2), then max_heap contains one tuple (-diff1, i, 0). Otherwise, max_heap contains one tuple (-diff2, i, m - 1).**
