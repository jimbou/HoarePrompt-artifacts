Postcondition: ***t is 0, n is greater than 0, m is an integer, a is a list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, max_heap is a list of n-1 tuples. If item[2] is less than tp1 or greater than tp2, then tp1 and tp2 are updated based on the comparison of diff1 and diff2, ans is updated to the maximum of diff1 and diff2, and item is the smallest tuple from the original max_heap. Otherwise, ans is -item[0], and if the third element of item is equal to tp1, then tp1 is 1 and the second element of item is greater than or equal to tp1 and less than or equal to m - 1. If the third element of item is not equal to tp1, then tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 2, and the second element of item is greater than or equal to tp1 and less than or equal to tp2.***
