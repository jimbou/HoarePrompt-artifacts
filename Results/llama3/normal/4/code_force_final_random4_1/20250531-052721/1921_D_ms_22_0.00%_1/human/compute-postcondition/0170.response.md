Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers, `max_heap` is not empty and its size is reduced by 1, `i` is the last integer in the list, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the last integer in list `a` and the first integer in list `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the last integer in list `a` and the last integer in list `b`, `item` is the largest tuple that was in `max_heap` but is now removed, `tp1` is either 1 or 2, `tp2` is either `m - 1` or `m - 2`, `ans` is increased by the negation of the first element of the largest tuple that was in `max_heap`, and stdin contains no input. If the absolute difference between the largest tuple that was in `max_heap` and the first integer in list `b` is greater than the absolute difference between the largest tuple that was in `max_heap` and the last integer in list `b`, then `tp1` is 2, `tp2` is `m - 1`, and the absolute difference between the largest tuple that was in `max_heap` and the first integer in list `b` is less than or equal to the current value of `diff2`. If the third element of the largest tuple that was in `max_heap` equals `tp1`, then `tp1` is 2. Otherwise, `tp2` is `m - 2`. In both cases, `ans` is increased by the negation of the first element of the largest tuple that was in `max_heap`. If the absolute difference between the largest tuple that was in `max_heap` and the first integer in list `b` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the largest tuple that was in `max_heap` and the last integer in list `b`, then `tp1` is 1, `tp2` is `m - 2`, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the absolute difference between the largest tuple that was in `max_heap` and the last integer in list `b`, and the absolute difference between the largest tuple that was in `max_heap` and the first integer in list `b` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the largest tuple that was in `max_heap` and the second last integer in list `b`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `tp1` is increased by 1, and all other variables remain the same. The value of `tp1` can be either 1 or 2, and the value of `tp2` can be either `m - 1` or `m - 2`. The value of `ans` is increased by the negation of the first element of the largest tuple that was in `max_heap`. The conditions for `tp1` and `tp2` are updated based on the new value of `tp1`.
