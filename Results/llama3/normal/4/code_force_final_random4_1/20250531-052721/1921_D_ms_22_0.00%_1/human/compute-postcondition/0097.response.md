Postcondition: ***`t` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers, `max_heap` is a list of `n-1` tuples, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is `-item[0]`, `item` is the smallest tuple from the original `max_heap`, and the second element of `item` is greater than or equal to `tp1` and less than or equal to `tp2`, and the third element of `item` is not equal to `tp1`***
