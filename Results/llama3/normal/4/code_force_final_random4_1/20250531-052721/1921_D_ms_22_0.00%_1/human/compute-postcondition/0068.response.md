Postcondition: **t is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 integer, i is the first integer in the list a, b is a sorted list of m integers, max_heap is an empty list, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, diff1 is the absolute difference between i and the first integer in the list b, diff2 is the absolute difference between i and the last integer in the list b, stdin contains no input. The current value of diff1 is greater than diff2.**
