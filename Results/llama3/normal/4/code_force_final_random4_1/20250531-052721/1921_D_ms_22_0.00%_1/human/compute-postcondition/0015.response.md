Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, n is greater than 0, m is an integer, a is a list of n integers that must have at least 2 elements, b is a sorted list of m integers, max_heap is a list containing two tuples with the minimum absolute differences between the first and second elements in a and either the first or last element in b, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, i is the second element in a, diff1 is the absolute difference between the second element in a and the first element in b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the second element in a and the last element in b, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. The if else block executes and the max_heap is updated with the minimum absolute differences between the first and second elements in a and either the first or last element in b, regardless of whether diff1 is greater than diff2 or not.***
