Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, max_heap is an empty list, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case
Code of the loop:
for i in a:
    diff1 = abs(i - b[0])
    diff2 = abs(i - b[m - 1])
    if diff1 > diff2:
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff1, i, 0))
    else:
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff2, i, m - 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 element, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers, `max_heap` is a list containing one tuple with the minimum absolute difference between the first element in `a` and either the first or last element in `b`, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `i` is the first element in `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the first element in `a` and the first element in `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the first element in `a` and the last element in `b`, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, n is greater than 0, m is an integer, a is a list of n integers that must have at least 2 elements, b is a sorted list of m integers, max_heap is a list containing two tuples with the minimum absolute differences between the first and second elements in a and either the first or last element in b, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, i is the second element in a, diff1 is the absolute difference between the second element in a and the first element in b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the second element in a and the last element in b, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. The if else block executes and the max_heap is updated with the minimum absolute differences between the first and second elements in a and either the first or last element in b, regardless of whether diff1 is greater than diff2 or not.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, n is greater than 0, m is an integer, a is a list of n integers that must have at least 3 elements, b is a sorted list of m integers, max_heap is a list containing two or three tuples with the minimum absolute differences between the first and second elements in a and either the first or last element in b, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, i is the third element in a, diff1 is the absolute difference between the third element in a and the first element in b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the third element in a and the last element in b, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. If diff1 > diff2, max_heap now contains a new tuple with the negative of the absolute difference between the third element in a and the first element in b, the third element in a, and 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
