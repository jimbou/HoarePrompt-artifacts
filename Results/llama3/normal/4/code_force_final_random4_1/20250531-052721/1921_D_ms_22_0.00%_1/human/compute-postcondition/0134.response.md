Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 integer, b is a sorted list of m integers, max_heap is a list containing one tuple, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, i is the first integer in the list, stdin contains no input. If the absolute difference between the first integer in list a and the first integer in list b (diff1) is greater than the absolute difference between the first integer in list a and the last integer in list b (diff2), then max_heap contains one tuple (-diff1, i, 0). Otherwise, max_heap contains one tuple (-diff2, i, m - 1).***
