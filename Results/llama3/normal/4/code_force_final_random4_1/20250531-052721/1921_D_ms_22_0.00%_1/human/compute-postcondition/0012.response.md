Output State: **t is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, n is greater than 0, m is an integer, a is a list of n integers that must have at least 2 elements, b is a sorted list of m integers, max_heap is a list containing one tuple with the minimum absolute difference between the first element in a and either the first or last element in b, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, i is the second element in a, diff1 is the absolute difference between the second element in a and the first element in b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the second element in a and the last element in b, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**

The code modifies the values of `diff1` and `diff2` by recalculating the absolute differences between the second element in `a` (which is `i`) and the first and last elements in `b`, respectively. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
