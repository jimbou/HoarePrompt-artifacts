Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 2 elements, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers, `max_heap` is a list containing two tuples with the minimum absolute differences between the first and second elements in `a` and either the first or last element in `b`, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `i` is the second element in `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second element in `a` and the first element in `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the second element in `a` and the last element in `b`, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**

In this output state, the `max_heap` list now contains two tuples. The first tuple is the original one with the minimum absolute difference between the first element in `a` and either the first or last element in `b`. The second tuple is the newly added one with the absolute difference between the second element in `a` and the first element in `b`, along with the index `i` of the second element in `a` and the position 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
