Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers, `max_heap` is a list of `n-3` tuples and is not empty, `ans` is updated based on the previous iteration and the smallest tuple from the original `max_heap` list, `item` is the smallest tuple from the original `max_heap` list, `ans` is increased by the negation of the first element of `item`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `max_heap`, and `item` remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is updated by adding the negation of the first element of `item`, which is the smallest tuple from the original `max_heap` list.
