You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for modifying the program state so that the next iteration of the `while` loop can proceed. You will be provided with the program state after the previous iteration, which you need to modify. You will also see the `while` loop statement. If it is a `while True` loop or if the loop can certainly execute one more time, please simply repeat the program state at the end of the previous iteration. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 10,  `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 3.
```
while i < n:
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.


Example Answer:
The variables in the loop head are i and n, so we can only adjust them.. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 3. `n` being greater than 3 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 4. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 4,  `n` must be greater than 4**

Example 2:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 0,  students is 3 less than its initial value.
```
while students >=1 :
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.


Example Answer:
The only variable in the loop head is variable students, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable students.  If students is greater than or equal to 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, students is 3 less than its initial value, So for the loop to be executed one more time the initial value of students needed to have been equal or greater than 4 and students currently must be greater than 1.
State: **`total` is 0, students is 3 less than its initial value and students currently must be greater or equal to 1**


Your Task:
State at the end of the previous iteration: *t is 0, n is greater than 0, m is an integer, a is a list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, max_heap is not empty and its size is reduced by 1, i is the last integer in the list, diff1 is the absolute difference between the first element of the largest tuple that was in max_heap and the integer at index tp1 in list b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the first element of the largest tuple that was in max_heap and the integer at index tp2 in list b, item is the largest tuple that was in max_heap but is now removed, tp1 and tp2 are either 0, 1, m - 1, or m - 2, and ans is the original value of ans plus the absolute difference between the largest tuple that was in max_heap and either the last integer in list b or the integer at index tp1 or tp2 in list b. If the third element of the largest tuple that was in max_heap equals tp1, then tp1 is either 1 or 2. Otherwise, tp2 is either m - 2 or m - 3. In both cases, ans is increased by the negation of the first element of the largest tuple that was in max_heap. If the absolute difference between the largest tuple that was in max_heap and the first integer in list b is greater than the absolute difference between the largest tuple that was in max_heap and the last integer in list b, then tp1 is either 1 or 2, tp2 is either m - 1 or m - 2, and the absolute difference between the largest tuple that was in max_heap and the first integer in list b is less than or equal to the current value of diff2. If the absolute difference between the largest tuple that was in max_heap and the first integer in list b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the largest tuple that was in max_heap and the last integer in list b, then tp1 is either 0 or 1, tp2 is either m - 2 or m - 3, ans is the original value of ans plus the absolute difference between the largest tuple that was in max_heap and the last integer in list b, and the absolute difference between the largest tuple that was in max_heap and the first integer in list b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the largest tuple that was in max_heap and the second last integer in list b. stdin contains no input.
```
while max_heap:
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.
