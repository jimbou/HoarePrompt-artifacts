Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of n integers, `b` is a sorted list of m integers, `max_heap` is a list of n-2 tuples and is not empty, `ans` is updated based on the previous iteration and the smallest tuple from the original `max_heap` list, `item` is the smallest tuple from the original `max_heap` list, `tp1` is increased by 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `tp1` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` still contains n integers, list `b` is still sorted and contains m integers, `max_heap` is still a non-empty list of n-2 tuples, and `ans` is still updated based on the previous iteration and the smallest tuple from the original `max_heap` list. The smallest tuple from the original `max_heap` list is still stored in `item`.
