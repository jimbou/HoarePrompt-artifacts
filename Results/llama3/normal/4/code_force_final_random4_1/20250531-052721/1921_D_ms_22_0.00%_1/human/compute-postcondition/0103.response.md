Output State: **t is 0, n is greater than 0, m is an integer, a is a list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, max_heap is a list of n-2 tuples and is not empty, ans is updated based on the previous iteration, item is the smallest tuple from the original max_heap list, diff1 is the absolute difference between the second element of item and the element at index tp1 in b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the second element of item and the element at index tp2 in b**.

In this final state, all variables from the initial state remain unchanged except for the introduction of two new variables, `diff1` and `diff2`, which are calculated based on the values of `item`, `b`, `tp1`, and `tp2`. The values of `diff1` and `diff2` are the absolute differences between the second element of `item` and the elements at indices `tp1` and `tp2` in the sorted list `b`, respectively.
