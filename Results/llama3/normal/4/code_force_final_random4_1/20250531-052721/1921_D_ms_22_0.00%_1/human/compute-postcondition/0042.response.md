Output State: **t is 1, n is greater than 0, m is an integer, a is an empty list, b is a sorted list of m integers, max_heap is a non-empty list containing n - 2 tuples with the minimum absolute differences between each element in a and either the first or last element in b, item is a tuple with the minimum absolute difference between an element in a and either the first or last element in b, diff1 is the absolute difference between item[1] and the first element in b, diff2 is the absolute difference between item[1] and the last element in b, ans is increased by diff1.**

In this final state, the value of `t` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `ans` has been increased by the value of `diff1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
