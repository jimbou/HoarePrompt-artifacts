Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is an empty list, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers, `max_heap` is a non-empty list containing `n - 2` tuples with the minimum absolute differences between each element in `a` and either the first or last element in `b`, `item` is a tuple with the minimum absolute difference between an element in `a` and either the first or last element in `b`, `ans` is increased by the negative of the first element of `item`**.

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is increased by the negative of the minimum absolute difference between an element in `a` and either the first or last element in `b`, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged.
