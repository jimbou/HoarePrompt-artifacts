According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. If `a` has at least 1 integer the loop executes. Before the loop starts, `t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers, `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `stdin` contains no input. So for the loop to be executed  the list `a` must have at least 1 integer and `i` is the first integer in the list.
State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 integer, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers, `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is the first integer in the list**
