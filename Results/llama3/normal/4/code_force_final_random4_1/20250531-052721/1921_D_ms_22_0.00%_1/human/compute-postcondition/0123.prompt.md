Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is 0, n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, max_heap is a list of n tuples, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, stdin contains no input.
Code of the loop:
while max_heap:
    item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
    if item[2] < tp1 or item[2] > tp2:
        diff1 = abs(item[1] - b[tp1])
        diff2 = abs(item[1] - b[tp2])
        if diff1 > diff2:
            tp1 += 1
            ans += diff1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1
            ans += diff2
    else:
        ans += -item[0]
        if item[2] == tp1:
            tp1 += 1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is 0, n is greater than 0, m is an integer, a is a list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, max_heap is a list of n-1 tuples. If item[2] is less than tp1 or greater than tp2, then tp1 and tp2 are updated based on the comparison of diff1 and diff2, ans is updated to the maximum of diff1 and diff2, and item is the smallest tuple from the original max_heap. Otherwise, ans is -item[0], and if the third element of item is equal to tp1, then tp1 is 1 and the second element of item is greater than or equal to tp1 and less than or equal to m - 1. If the third element of item is not equal to tp1, then tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 2, and the second element of item is greater than or equal to tp1 and less than or equal to tp2.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *t is 0, n is greater than 0, m is an integer, a is a list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, max_heap is a list of n-2 tuples and is not empty, ans is updated based on the previous iteration and the smallest tuple from the original max_heap list, item is the smallest tuple from the original max_heap list. If item[2] is less than tp1 or greater than tp2, then tp1 is incremented by 1 if diff1 is greater than diff2, otherwise tp2 is decreased by 1. If item[2] is equal to tp1, then tp1 is increased by 1, otherwise tp2 is decreased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is 0, n is greater than 0, m is an integer, a is a list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, max_heap is a list of n-3 tuples and is not empty, ans is updated based on the previous iteration and the smallest tuple from the original max_heap list, item is the smallest tuple from the original max_heap list. If item[2] is less than tp1 or greater than tp2, then if diff1 is greater than diff2, ans is updated by adding the absolute difference between the second element of the smallest tuple from the original max_heap list and the tp1th element of b, and tp1 is incremented by 1. Otherwise, diff2 is updated to be the absolute difference between the second element of the smallest tuple from the original max_heap list and the (tp2-1)th element of b, and tp2 is decremented by 1. If item[2] is not less than tp1 and not greater than tp2, then ans is increased by the negation of the first element of item. If item[2] equals tp1, then tp1 is increased by 1. Otherwise, tp2 is decreased by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
