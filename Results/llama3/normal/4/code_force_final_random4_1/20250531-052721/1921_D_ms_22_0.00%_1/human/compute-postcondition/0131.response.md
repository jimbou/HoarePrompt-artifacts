Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 integer, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers, `max_heap` is a list containing one tuple (-diff1, i, 0), `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `i` is the first integer in the list, the absolute difference between the first integer in list `a` and the first integer in list `b` (diff1) is greater than the absolute difference between the first integer in list `a` and the last integer in list `b` (diff2), stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is decreased by 1 but still greater than 0. The lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged. The `max_heap` list now contains a tuple with the negative difference between the first integer in list `a` and the first integer in list `b`, the index of the first integer in list `a`, and 0. The values of `tp1`, `tp2`, and `ans` are unchanged. The first integer in list `a` is still `i`. The relationship between the differences `diff1` and `diff2` remains the same. There is no input in `stdin`.
