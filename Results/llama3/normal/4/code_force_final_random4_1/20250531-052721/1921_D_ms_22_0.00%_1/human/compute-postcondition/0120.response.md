Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers, `max_heap` is a list of `n-3` tuples and is not empty, `ans` is updated based on the previous iteration and the smallest tuple from the original `max_heap` list, `item` is the smallest tuple from the original `max_heap` list, `ans` is increased by the negation of the first element of `item`, and `tp2` is decreased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `tp2` has been decreased by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The list `max_heap` is still not empty, and `ans` is still updated based on the previous iteration and the smallest tuple from the original `max_heap` list. The value of `item` is still the smallest tuple from the original `max_heap` list, and `ans` is still increased by the negation of the first element of `item`.
