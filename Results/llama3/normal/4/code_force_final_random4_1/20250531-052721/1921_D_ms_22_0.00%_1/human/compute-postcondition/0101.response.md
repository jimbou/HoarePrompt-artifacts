The only variable in the loop head is variable max_heap, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable max_heap.  If max_heap is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, max_heap is a list of n-1 tuples. So for the loop to be executed one more time max_heap must not be empty.
State: **t is 0, n is greater than 0, m is an integer, a is a list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, max_heap is a list of n-1 tuples and is not empty, ans is updated based on the previous iteration**
