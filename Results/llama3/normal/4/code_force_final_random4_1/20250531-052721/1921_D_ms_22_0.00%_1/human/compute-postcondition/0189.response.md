Postcondition: ***The program processes multiple test cases from stdin. For each test case, it reads two integers n and m, a list of n integers a, and a list of m integers b. If the program is run as the main module, it calculates the sum of the absolute differences between each element in a and its closest element in the sorted list b, and stores this sum in the variable ans. The program maintains a max heap and keeps track of indices tp1 and tp2. If the program is not run as the main module, no action is taken.***
