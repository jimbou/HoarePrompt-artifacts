Postcondition: ***`t` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is an empty list, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers, `max_heap` is a list containing `n - 1` tuples with the minimum absolute differences between each element in `a` and either the first or last element in `b`, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `item` is the tuple with the smallest minimum absolute difference, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one test case. The second element of `item` is greater than or equal to `tp1` and less than or equal to `tp2`***
