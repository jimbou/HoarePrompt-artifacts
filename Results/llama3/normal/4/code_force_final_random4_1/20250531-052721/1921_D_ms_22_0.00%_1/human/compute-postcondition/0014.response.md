Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 2 elements, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers, `max_heap` is a list containing two tuples with the minimum absolute differences between the first and second elements in `a` and either the first or last element in `b`, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `i` is the second element in `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second element in `a` and the first element in `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the second element in `a` and the last element in `b`, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` has decreased by 1, and it is still greater than 0. The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`, `i`, `diff1`, and `diff2` remain unchanged. The `max_heap` now contains two tuples, one with the minimum absolute difference between the first element in `a` and either the first or last element in `b`, and another with the minimum absolute difference between the second element in `a` and the last element in `b`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one test case.
