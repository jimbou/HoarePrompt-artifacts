Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 element, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers, `max_heap` is a list containing one tuple (-diff2, i, m - 1), `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `i` is the first element in `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the first element in `a` and the first element in `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the first element in `a` and the last element in `b`, and the absolute difference between the first element in `a` and the first element in `b` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the first element in `a` and the last element in `b`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` has decreased by 1, and a tuple containing the negative of the absolute difference between the first element in `a` and the last element in `b`, the first element in `a`, and the last index of `b` has been pushed into the `max_heap`. The values of the other variables remain the same.
