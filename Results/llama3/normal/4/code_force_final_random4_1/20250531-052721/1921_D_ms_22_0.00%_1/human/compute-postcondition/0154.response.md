Postcondition: **t is 0, n is greater than 0, m is an integer, a is a list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, max_heap is a list containing n-1 tuples, i is the last integer in the list, item is the largest tuple in max_heap, stdin contains no input. If the absolute difference between the largest tuple in max_heap and the first integer in list b is greater than the absolute difference between the largest tuple in max_heap and the last integer in list b, then tp1 is 1, tp2 is m - 1, ans is greater than 0, and the absolute difference between the largest tuple in max_heap and the first integer in list b is less than or equal to the current value of diff2. Otherwise, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 2, ans is the original value of ans plus the absolute difference between the largest tuple in max_heap and the last integer in list b, and the absolute difference between the largest tuple in max_heap and the first integer in list b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the largest tuple in max_heap and the second last integer in list b.**
