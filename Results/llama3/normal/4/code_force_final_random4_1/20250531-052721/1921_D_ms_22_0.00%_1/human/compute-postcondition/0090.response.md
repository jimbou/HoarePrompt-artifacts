Postcondition: ***t is 0, n is greater than 0, m is an integer, a is a list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, max_heap is a list of n-1 tuples, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, item is the smallest tuple from the original max_heap, diff1 is the absolute difference between item[1] and b[tp1], diff2 is the absolute difference between item[1] and b[tp2], stdin contains no input, and the absolute difference between item[1] and b[tp1] is less than or equal to the absolute difference between item[1] and b[tp2].***
