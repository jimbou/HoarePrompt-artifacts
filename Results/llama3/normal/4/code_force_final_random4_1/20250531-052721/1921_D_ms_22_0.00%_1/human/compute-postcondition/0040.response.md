Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is an empty list, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers, `max_heap` is a non-empty list containing `n - 2` tuples with the minimum absolute differences between each element in `a` and either the first or last element in `b`, `item` is a tuple with the minimum absolute difference between an element in `a` and either the first or last element in `b`.**

The code removes the tuple with the maximum absolute difference from the `max_heap` and assigns it to the variable `item`. The size of `max_heap` is reduced by 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
