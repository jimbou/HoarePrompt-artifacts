Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is the first integer in the list `a`, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers, `max_heap` is a list containing one tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)`, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first integer in the list `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last integer in the list `b`, and stdin contains no input. The current value of `diff1` is greater than `diff2`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is decreased by 1 but still greater than 0. The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `i`, `b`, `tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`, `diff1`, and `diff2` remain the same. The `max_heap` list now contains a tuple with the negative value of `diff1`, the value of `i`, and 0. The stdin still contains no input. The relationship between `diff1` and `diff2` remains the same, with `diff1` being greater than `diff2`.
