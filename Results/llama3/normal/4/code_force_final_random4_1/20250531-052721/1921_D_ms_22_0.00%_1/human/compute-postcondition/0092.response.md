Postcondition: ***t is 0, n is greater than 0, m is an integer, a is a list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, max_heap is a list of n-1 tuples, tp1 and tp2 are updated based on the comparison of diff1 and diff2, ans is updated to the maximum of diff1 and diff2, item is the smallest tuple from the original max_heap, diff1 is the absolute difference between item[1] and b[tp1], diff2 is the absolute difference between item[1] and b[tp2], and stdin contains no input.***
