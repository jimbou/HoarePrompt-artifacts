Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 3 integers, `i` is the third integer in the list `a`, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first integer in the list `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last integer in the list `b`, `max_heap` contains a tuple with the value (-`diff1`, `i`, 0) if `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, otherwise `max_heap` contains a tuple with the negative value of `diff2`, `i`, and `m - 1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` has decreased by 1 but is still greater than 0. The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `i`, `b`, `diff1`, and `diff2` remain the same. The `max_heap` now contains a new tuple with the value (-`diff1`, `i`, 0) if `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, otherwise it contains a tuple with the negative value of `diff2`, `i`, and `m - 1`.
