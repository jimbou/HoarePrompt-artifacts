The code `item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)` removes and returns the smallest item from the `max_heap` list, which is a list of `n` tuples. The smallest item is removed from the heap and assigned to the variable `item`. The `max_heap` list now contains `n-1` tuples.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers, `max_heap` is a list of `n-1` tuples, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `item` is the smallest tuple from the original `max_heap`, `stdin` contains no input.**
