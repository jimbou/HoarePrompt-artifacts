Postcondition: ***t, n, m are integers, a is an empty list, b is a sorted list of m integers, max_heap is a non-empty list containing at least one tuple with the minimum absolute differences between each element in a and either the first or last element in b, item is a tuple with the minimum absolute difference between an element in a and either the first or last element in b that was previously at the top of max_heap, diff1 is the absolute difference between the second element of item and the first element of b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the second element of item and the last element of b. If diff1 > diff2, tp1 is incremented by 1 and ans is incremented by diff1. Otherwise, tp2 is one less than its original value and ans is increased by the value of diff2.***
