Output State: **`t`, `n`, `m` are integers, `a` is an empty list, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers, `max_heap` is a non-empty list containing at least one tuple with the minimum absolute differences between each element in `a` and either the first or last element in `b`, `item` is a tuple with the minimum absolute difference between an element in `a` and either the first or last element in `b` that was previously at the top of `max_heap`, `max_heap` has one less tuple than before, `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between an element in `a` and either the first or last element in `b` that was previously at the top of `max_heap`, and `tp2` is decreased by 1.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their previous values and properties, except for `tp2`, which has been decremented by 1. The list `a` remains empty, and list `b` remains sorted with `m` integers. The `max_heap` still contains tuples with the minimum absolute differences, but with one less tuple than before. The `item` variable still holds the tuple with the minimum absolute difference that was previously at the top of `max_heap`. The `ans` variable has been increased by the absolute difference between an element in `a` and either the first or last element in `b` that was previously at the top of `max_heap`.
