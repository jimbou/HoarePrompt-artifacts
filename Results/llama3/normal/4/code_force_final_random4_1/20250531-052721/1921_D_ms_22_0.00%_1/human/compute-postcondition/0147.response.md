Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers, `max_heap` is a list containing `n-1` tuples, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `i` is the last integer in the list, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the last integer in list `a` and the first integer in list `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the last integer in list `a` and the last integer in list `b`, `item` is the largest tuple in `max_heap` and stdin contains no input.**

The code removes the largest tuple from the `max_heap` list and assigns it to the variable `item`. The size of `max_heap` is reduced by 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
