The value of `ans` is increased by the negation of the first element of `item`. The first element of `item` is the largest tuple in `max_heap`, and its second element is greater than or equal to `tp1` and less than or equal to `tp2`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers, `max_heap` is a list containing `n-1` tuples, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is increased by the negation of the first element of the largest tuple in `max_heap`, `i` is the last integer in the list, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the last integer in list `a` and the first integer in list `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the last integer in list `a` and the last integer in list `b`, `item` is the largest tuple in `max_heap`, and stdin contains no input.**
