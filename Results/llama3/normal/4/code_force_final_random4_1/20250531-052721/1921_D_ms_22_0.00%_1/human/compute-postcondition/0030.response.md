Postcondition: **t is 0, n is greater than 0, m is an integer, a is an empty list, b is a sorted list of m integers, max_heap is a list containing n - 1 tuples with the minimum absolute differences between each element in a and either the first or last element in b. If the absolute difference between item[1] and the first element in b is greater than the absolute difference between item[1] and the last element in b, then tp1 is 1, tp2 is m - 1, and ans is equal to the original value of ans plus the original value of diff1. Otherwise, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 2, and ans is equal to diff2.**
