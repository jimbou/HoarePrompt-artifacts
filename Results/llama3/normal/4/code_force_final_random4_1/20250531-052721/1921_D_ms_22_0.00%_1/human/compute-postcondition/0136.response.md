Output State: **t is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of n integers that must have at least 2 integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, max_heap is a list containing one tuple, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, i is the second integer in the list, diff1 is the absolute difference between the second integer in list a and the first integer in list b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the second integer in list a and the last integer in list b, stdin contains no input.**

The code snippet calculates the absolute differences between the second integer in list `a` and the first and last integers in list `b`, assigning these values to `diff1` and `diff2`, respectively. No other variables are affected by the code. The initial state remains valid, with the addition of the new variables `diff1` and `diff2` and their calculated values.
