Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers, `max_heap` is a list containing `n-1` tuples, `tp1` is 1, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is increased by the negation of the first element of the largest tuple in `max_heap`, `i` is the last integer in the list, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the last integer in list `a` and the first integer in list `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the last integer in list `a` and the last integer in list `b`, `item` is the largest tuple in `max_heap`, and stdin contains no input. The current value of `item[2]` is not equal to `tp1`**

In this output state, the value of `tp1` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that `item[2]` is equal to `tp1` is no longer true, as `tp1` has been incremented.
