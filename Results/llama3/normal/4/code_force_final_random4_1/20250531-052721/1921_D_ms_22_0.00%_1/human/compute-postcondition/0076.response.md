Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is the second integer in the list `a`, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first integer in the list `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last integer in the list `b`, `max_heap` contains a tuple with the negative value of `diff2`, `i`, and `m - 1`**.

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `i`, `b`, `diff1`, and `diff2` remain unchanged. The only change is that a tuple containing the negative value of `diff2`, `i`, and `m - 1` is added to the `max_heap`. This is because `heapq.heappush` adds an element to the heap, and in this case, the element is a tuple with the specified values.
