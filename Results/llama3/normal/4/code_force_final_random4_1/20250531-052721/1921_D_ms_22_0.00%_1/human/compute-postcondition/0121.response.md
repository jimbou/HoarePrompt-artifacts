Postcondition: **`t` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers, `max_heap` is a list of `n-3` tuples and is not empty, `ans` is updated based on the previous iteration and the smallest tuple from the original `max_heap` list, `item` is the smallest tuple from the original `max_heap` list, `ans` is increased by the negation of the first element of `item`. If `item[2]` equals `tp1`, then `tp1` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1.**
