The code `item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)` removes and returns the smallest item from the `max_heap` list, which is a list of n-1 tuples. The `heapq.heappop` function modifies the `max_heap` list in-place, reducing its length by 1.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of n integers, `b` is a sorted list of m integers, `max_heap` is a list of n-2 tuples and is not empty, `ans` is updated based on the previous iteration, `item` is the smallest tuple from the original `max_heap` list**
