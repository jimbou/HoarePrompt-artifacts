Postcondition: ***`t` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of n integers, `b` is a sorted list of m integers, `max_heap` is a list of n-2 tuples and is not empty, `ans` is updated based on the previous iteration and the smallest tuple from the original `max_heap` list, `item` is the smallest tuple from the original `max_heap` list. If `item[2]` is equal to `tp1`, then `tp1` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1.***
