Output State: **t is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of n integers that must have at least 3 integers, i is the third integer in the list a, b is a sorted list of m integers, stdin contains no input, diff1 is the absolute difference between i and the first integer in the list b, diff2 is the absolute difference between i and the last integer in the list b. If diff1 is greater than diff2, max_heap contains a tuple with the value (-diff1, i, 0). Otherwise, max_heap contains a tuple with the negative value of diff2, i, and m - 1, diff1 is the absolute difference between i and the first integer in the list b, diff2 is the absolute difference between i and the last integer in the list b.**

The code snippet calculates the absolute differences between the third integer in list `a` and the first and last integers in list `b`, and assigns these values to `diff1` and `diff2`, respectively. The values of `diff1` and `diff2` are updated to reflect the new calculations. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
