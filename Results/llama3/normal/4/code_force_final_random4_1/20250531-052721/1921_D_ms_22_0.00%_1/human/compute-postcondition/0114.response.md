Output State: **t is 0, n is greater than 0, m is an integer, a is a list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, max_heap is a list of n-3 tuples and is not empty, ans is updated based on the previous iteration and the smallest tuple from the original max_heap list, item is the smallest tuple from the original max_heap list, diff1 is the absolute difference between the second element of the smallest tuple from the original max_heap list and the tp1th element of b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the second element of the smallest tuple from the original max_heap list and the tp2th element of b.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `max_heap`, `ans`, and `item` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The code only introduces two new variables, `diff1` and `diff2`, which are calculated based on the existing values of `item` and `b`. The values of `diff1` and `diff2` are the absolute differences between the second element of the smallest tuple from the original `max_heap` list and the `tp1th` and `tp2th` elements of `b`, respectively.
