Output State: **t is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, max_heap is an empty list, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, stdin contains no input**.

The code snippet modifies the initial state by decrementing `t` by 1, assigning new values to `n` and `m` from the input, creating a new list `a` of `n` integers from the input, creating a new sorted list `b` of `m` integers from the input, initializing an empty list `max_heap`, and resetting `tp1` to 0 and `tp2` to `m - 1`. The variable `ans` is reset to 0. The input is consumed, leaving stdin empty.
