Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, n is greater than 0, m is an integer, a is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 element, b is a sorted list of m integers, max_heap is an empty list, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, i is the first element in a, diff1 is the absolute difference between the first element in a and the first element in b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the first element in a and the last element in b. The absolute difference between the first element in a and the first element in b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the first element in a and the last element in b***
