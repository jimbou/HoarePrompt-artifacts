Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is an empty list, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers, `max_heap` is a list containing `n - 1` tuples with the minimum absolute differences between each element in `a` and either the first or last element in `b`, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 2`, `ans` is `-item[0]`, `item` is the tuple with the smallest minimum absolute difference, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one test case. The second element of `item` is greater than or equal to `tp1` and less than or equal to `tp2`, and `item[2]` is not equal to `tp1`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `tp2` has been decremented by 1, resulting in `tp2` being `m - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged. The second element of `item` is still within the range of `tp1` and `tp2`, and `item[2]` is still not equal to `tp1`.
