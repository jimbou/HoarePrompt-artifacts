The variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t.  If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is 0, So for the loop to be executed one more time t must be greater than 0.
State: **t is greater than 0, n is 0, m is an integer, a is an empty list, b is a sorted list of m integers, max_heap is an empty list, tp1 is m, tp2 is -1, ans is the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each element in a and either the first or last element in b, and the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each element in a and either the first or last element in b which is ans is being printed**
