Output State: **`t`, `n`, `m` are integers, `a` is an empty list, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers, `max_heap` is a non-empty list containing at least one tuple with the minimum absolute differences between each element in `a` and either the first or last element in `b`, `item` is a tuple with the minimum absolute difference between an element in `a` and either the first or last element in `b` that was previously at the top of `max_heap`, `max_heap` has one less tuple than before, and `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between an element in `a` and either the first or last element in `b` that was previously at the top of `max_heap`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `max_heap`, and `item` remain the same as in the initial state. However, the value of `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between an element in `a` and either the first or last element in `b` that was previously at the top of `max_heap`.
