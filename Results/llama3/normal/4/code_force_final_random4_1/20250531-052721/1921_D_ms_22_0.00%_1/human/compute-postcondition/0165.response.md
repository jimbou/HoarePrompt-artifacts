Output State: **t is 0, n is greater than 0, m is an integer, a is a list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, max_heap is not empty and its size is reduced by 1, i is the last integer in the list, diff1 is the absolute difference between the first element of the largest tuple that was in max_heap and the integer at index tp1 in list b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the first element of the largest tuple that was in max_heap and the integer at index tp2 in list b, item is the largest tuple that was in max_heap but is now removed, tp1 is either 0 or 1, tp2 is either m - 1 or m - 2, and ans is either the original value of ans plus the absolute difference between the largest tuple that was in max_heap and the last integer in list b or the original value of ans plus the negation of the first element of the largest tuple that was in max_heap, stdin contains no input.**

In this final state, the values of `diff1` and `diff2` have been updated based on the absolute differences between the first element of the largest tuple that was in `max_heap` and the integers at indices `tp1` and `tp2` in list `b`, respectively. The values of `tp1` and `tp2` have been updated based on the conditions specified in the precondition. The value of `ans` has been updated based on the conditions specified in the precondition, either by adding the absolute difference between the largest tuple that was in `max_heap` and the last integer in list `b` or by adding the negation of the first element of the largest tuple that was in `max_heap`. All other variables remain unchanged.
