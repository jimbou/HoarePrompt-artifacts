Postcondition: ***t is 0, n is greater than 0, m is an integer, a is a list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, max_heap is a list of n-2 tuples and is not empty, ans is updated based on the previous iteration and the smallest tuple from the original max_heap list, item is the smallest tuple from the original max_heap list. If item[2] is less than tp1 or greater than tp2, then tp1 is incremented by 1 if diff1 is greater than diff2, otherwise tp2 is decreased by 1. If item[2] is equal to tp1, then tp1 is increased by 1, otherwise tp2 is decreased by 1.***
