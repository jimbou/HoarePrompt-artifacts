Postcondition: ***`t`, `n`, `m` are integers, `a` is an empty list, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers, `max_heap` is a non-empty list containing at least one tuple with the minimum absolute differences between each element in `a` and either the first or last element in `b`, `item` is a tuple with the minimum absolute difference between an element in `a` and either the first or last element in `b` that was previously at the top of `max_heap`, and `max_heap` has one less tuple than before. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, then `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and the first element of `b`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and the last element of `b`. If `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, then `tp1` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is incremented by `diff1`. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff2`. If `item[2]` is not less than `tp1` and not greater than `tp2`, then `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between an element in `a` and either the first or last element in `b` that was previously at the top of `max_heap`. If `item[2]` equals `tp1`, then `tp1` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1.***
