Postcondition: **t is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 integer, i is the first integer in the list a, b is a sorted list of m integers, stdin contains no input. If the absolute difference between i and the first integer in the list b is greater than the absolute difference between i and the last integer in the list b, then max_heap is a list containing one tuple (-diff1, i, 0), tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, and the current value of diff1 is greater than diff2. Otherwise, max_heap is a list containing one tuple (-diff2, i, m - 1), tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0.**
