Output State: **t is 0, n is greater than 0, m is an integer, a is an empty list, b is a sorted list of m integers, max_heap is a non-empty list containing n - 3 tuples with the minimum absolute differences between each element in a and either the first or last element in b, item is a tuple with the minimum absolute difference between an element in a and either the first or last element in b, diff1 is the absolute difference between item[1] and the first element in b, diff2 is the absolute difference between item[1] and the last element in b, tp2 is one less than its original value, ans is increased by diff2.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `item`, `diff1`, and `diff2` remain unchanged from the initial state. The value of `tp2` is decreased by 1, and the value of `ans` is increased by the value of `diff2`. The size of `max_heap` is reduced by 1, now containing `n - 3` tuples.
