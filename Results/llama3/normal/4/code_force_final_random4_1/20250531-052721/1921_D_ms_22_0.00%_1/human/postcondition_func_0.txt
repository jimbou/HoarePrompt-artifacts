This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers n and m, followed by a list of n integers a and a list of m integers b. It calculates the sum of the absolute differences between each element in a and its closest element in the sorted list b, and prints this sum for each test case. The function maintains a max heap and keeps track of indices tp1 and tp2 to efficiently find the closest elements.
