Output State: **t is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of n integers that must have at least 2 integers, i is the second integer in the list a, b is a sorted list of m integers, stdin contains no input, diff1 is the absolute difference between i and the first integer in the list b, diff2 is the absolute difference between i and the last integer in the list b.**

The code snippet calculates the absolute differences between the second integer in list `a` (denoted as `i`) and the first and last integers in the sorted list `b`. These differences are stored in `diff1` and `diff2`, respectively. The values of `diff1` and `diff2` are determined based on the initial state's conditions regarding the absolute differences between `i` and the first and last integers in list `b`. The rest of the variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `stdin`, `max_heap`, `tp1`, `tp2`, and `ans`) remain unchanged as they are not modified by the provided code snippet.
