Output State: **t is 0, n is greater than 0, m is an integer, a is an empty list, b is a sorted list of m integers, max_heap is a list containing n - 1 tuples with the minimum absolute differences between each element in a and either the first or last element in b, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, item is the tuple with the smallest minimum absolute difference, diff1 is the absolute difference between item[1] and the first element in b, diff2 is the absolute difference between item[1] and the last element in b.**

The code snippet calculates the absolute differences between the second element of the tuple `item` and the first and last elements of the sorted list `b`, and assigns these differences to `diff1` and `diff2`, respectively. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
