Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the total difference D. The issue lies in the way it handles the max heap and the pointers tp1 and tp2. The program pushes the differences between each element in array a and the smallest and largest elements in array b into the max heap. However, when popping elements from the heap, it does not correctly update the pointers tp1 and tp2.

A counterexample can be constructed as follows:

Input:

n = 3, m = 5
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

In this case, the program will push the differences (0, 1, 0), (0, 2, 0), and (0, 3, 0) into the max heap. When popping elements from the heap, it will first pop (0, 1, 0) and update tp1 to 1. Then, it will pop (0, 2, 0) and update tp1 to 2. Finally, it will pop (0, 3, 0) and update tp1 to 3. However, the correct output should be 0, not 3.

The correct approach would be to sort both arrays a and b, and then iterate through array a from left to right and array b from right to left, calculating the absolute difference between each pair of elements and adding it to the total difference D. This way, we can ensure that the total difference D is maximized.
