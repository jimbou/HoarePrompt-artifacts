Output State: **t is 0, n is greater than 0, m is an integer, a is a list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, max_heap is not empty and its size is reduced by 1, i is the last integer in the list, diff1 is the absolute difference between the first element of the largest tuple that was in max_heap and the integer at index tp1 in list b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the first element of the largest tuple that was in max_heap and the integer at index tp2 in list b, item is the largest tuple that was in max_heap but is now removed, tp1 is either 1 or 2, tp2 is either m - 1 or m - 2, and ans is the original value of ans plus the absolute difference between the largest tuple that was in max_heap and the last integer in list b plus the absolute difference between the first element of the largest tuple that was in max_heap and the integer at index tp1 in list b.**

The code increments tp1 by 1, so its new value is either 1 or 2. The code also adds diff1 to ans, so its new value is the original value of ans plus the absolute difference between the largest tuple that was in max_heap and the last integer in list b plus the absolute difference between the first element of the largest tuple that was in max_heap and the integer at index tp1 in list b.
