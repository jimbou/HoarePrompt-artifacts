Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, max_heap is an empty list, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, stdin contains no input
Code of the loop:
for i in a:
    diff1 = abs(i - b[0])
    diff2 = abs(i - b[m - 1])
    if diff1 > diff2:
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff1, i, 0))
    else:
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff2, i, m - 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 integer, b is a sorted list of m integers, max_heap is a list containing one tuple, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, i is the first integer in the list, stdin contains no input. If the absolute difference between the first integer in list a and the first integer in list b (diff1) is greater than the absolute difference between the first integer in list a and the last integer in list b (diff2), then max_heap contains one tuple (-diff1, i, 0). Otherwise, max_heap contains one tuple (-diff2, i, m - 1).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of n integers that must have at least 2 integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, max_heap is a list containing two tuples, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, i is the second integer in the list, diff1 is the absolute difference between the second integer in list a and the first integer in list b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the second integer in list a and the last integer in list b, stdin contains no input. The if condition is diff1 > diff2, but since the postconditions of the if and else parts are the same, the overall postcondition remains the same regardless of the condition.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of n integers that must have at least 3 integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, max_heap is a list containing three tuples, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, i is the third integer in the list, diff1 is the absolute difference between the third integer in list a and the first integer in list b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the third integer in list a and the last integer in list b, stdin contains no input. The number of tuples in max_heap is increased by 1 if the absolute difference between the third integer in list a and the first integer in list b is greater than the absolute difference between the third integer in list a and the last integer in list b.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
