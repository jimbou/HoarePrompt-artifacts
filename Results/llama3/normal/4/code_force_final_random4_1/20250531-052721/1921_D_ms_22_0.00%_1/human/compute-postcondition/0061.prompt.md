Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is 0, n is 0, m is an integer, a is an empty list, b is a sorted list of m integers, max_heap is a list containing n tuples with the minimum absolute differences between each element in a and either the first or last element in b, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.
Code of the loop:
while max_heap:
    item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
    if item[2] < tp1 or item[2] > tp2:
        diff1 = abs(item[1] - b[tp1])
        diff2 = abs(item[1] - b[tp2])
        if diff1 > diff2:
            tp1 += 1
            ans += diff1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1
            ans += diff2
    else:
        ans += -item[0]
        if item[2] == tp1:
            tp1 += 1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is an empty list, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers, `max_heap` is a list containing `n - 1` tuples with the minimum absolute differences between each element in `a` and either the first or last element in `b`. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, then `tp1` is either 0 or 1, `tp2` is either `m - 1` or `m - 2`, and `ans` is either the original value of `ans` plus the original value of `diff1` or `diff2`. Otherwise, `tp1` is either 0 or 1, `tp2` is either `m - 1` or `m - 2`, `ans` is `-item[0]`, and the second element of `item` is greater than or equal to `tp1` and less than or equal to `tp2`. If `item[2]` is equal to `tp1`, then `tp1` is 1, otherwise `tp1` is 0 and `tp2` is `m - 2`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t`, `n`, `m` are integers, `a` is an empty list, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers, `max_heap` is a non-empty list containing either `n - 2`, `n - 3` tuples with the minimum absolute differences between each element in `a` and either the first or last element in `b`, `item` is a tuple with the minimum absolute difference between an element in `a` and either the first or last element in `b`. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, then `t` is either 0 or 1, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is an empty list, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers, `max_heap` is a non-empty list containing either `n - 2` or `n - 3` tuples with the minimum absolute differences between each element in `a` and either the first or last element in `b`, `item` is a tuple with the minimum absolute difference between an element in `a` and either the first or last element in `b`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and the first element in `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and the last element in `b`. If `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, then `t` is 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff1`. Otherwise, `t` is 0, `max_heap` contains `n - 3` tuples, `tp2` is one less than its original value, and `ans` is increased by `diff2`. If `item[2]` is equal to `tp1`, then `t` is set to 1 and `ans` is increased by the negative of the first element of `item`. Otherwise, `t` remains 0, `tp2` is decreased by 1, and `ans` is increased by the negative of the first element of `item`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`t`, `n`, `m` are integers, `a` is an empty list, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers, `max_heap` is a non-empty list containing at least one tuple with the minimum absolute differences between each element in `a` and either the first or last element in `b`, `item` is a tuple with the minimum absolute difference between an element in `a` and either the first or last element in `b` that was previously at the top of `max_heap`, and `max_heap` has one less tuple than before. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, then `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and the first element of `b`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and the last element of `b`. If `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, then `tp1` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is incremented by `diff1`. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff2`. If `item[2]` is not less than `tp1` and not greater than `tp2`, then `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between an element in `a` and either the first or last element in `b` that was previously at the top of `max_heap`. If `item[2]` equals `tp1`, then `tp1` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
