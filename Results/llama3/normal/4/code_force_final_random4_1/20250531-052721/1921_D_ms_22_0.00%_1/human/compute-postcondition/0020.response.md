Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, n is greater than 0, m is an integer, a is a list of n integers that must have at least 3 elements, b is a sorted list of m integers, max_heap is a list containing two or three tuples with the minimum absolute differences between the first and second elements in a and either the first or last element in b, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, i is the third element in a, diff1 is the absolute difference between the third element in a and the first element in b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the third element in a and the last element in b, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. If diff1 > diff2, max_heap now contains a new tuple with the negative of the absolute difference between the third element in a and the first element in b, the third element in a, and 0.***
