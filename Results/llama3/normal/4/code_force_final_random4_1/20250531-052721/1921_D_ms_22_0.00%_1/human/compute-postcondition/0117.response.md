Postcondition: ***t is 0, n is greater than 0, m is an integer, a is a list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, max_heap is a list of n-3 tuples and is not empty, ans is updated based on the previous iteration and the smallest tuple from the original max_heap list, item is the smallest tuple from the original max_heap list. If diff1 > diff2, then ans is updated by adding the absolute difference between the second element of the smallest tuple from the original max_heap list and the tp1th element of b, and tp1 is incremented by 1. Otherwise, diff2 is updated to be the absolute difference between the second element of the smallest tuple from the original max_heap list and the (tp2-1)th element of b, and tp2 is decremented by 1.***
