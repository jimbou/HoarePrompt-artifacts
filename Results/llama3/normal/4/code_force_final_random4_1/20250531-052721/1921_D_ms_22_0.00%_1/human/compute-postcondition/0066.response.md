To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the list `a`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list `a` has at least 1 integer, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers, `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, and `stdin` contains no input. So for the loop to be executed, the list `a` must have at least 1 integer and `i` is the first integer in the list.

State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is the first integer in the list `a`, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers, `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `stdin` contains no input**
