Postcondition: ***t is 0, n is greater than 0, m is an integer, a is a list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, max_heap is a list of n-2 tuples and is not empty, ans is updated based on the previous iteration and the value of either diff1 or diff2, item is the smallest tuple from the original max_heap list, diff1 is the absolute difference between the second element of item and the element at index tp1 in b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the second element of item and the element at index tp2 in b. If diff1 > diff2, tp1 is incremented by 1. Otherwise, tp2 is one less than its original value.***
