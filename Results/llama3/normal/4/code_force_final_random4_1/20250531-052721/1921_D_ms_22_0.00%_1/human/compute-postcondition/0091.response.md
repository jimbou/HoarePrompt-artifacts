Output State: **t is 0, n is greater than 0, m is an integer, a is a list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, max_heap is a list of n-1 tuples, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 2, ans is the original value of ans plus the original value of diff2, item is the smallest tuple from the original max_heap, diff1 is the absolute difference between item[1] and b[tp1], diff2 is the absolute difference between item[1] and b[tp2], stdin contains no input, and the absolute difference between item[1] and b[tp1] is less than or equal to the absolute difference between item[1] and b[tp2].**

The code snippet modifies the values of `tp2` and `ans`. The first line decrements `tp2` by 1, making it `m - 2`. The second line adds the original value of `diff2` to `ans`, making it the original value of `ans` plus the original value of `diff2`. No other variables are affected. The rest of the variables remain the same as in the initial state.
