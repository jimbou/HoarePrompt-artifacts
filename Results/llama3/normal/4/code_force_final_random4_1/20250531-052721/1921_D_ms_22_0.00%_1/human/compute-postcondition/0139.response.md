Postcondition: **t is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of n integers that must have at least 2 integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, max_heap is a list containing two tuples, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, i is the second integer in the list, diff1 is the absolute difference between the second integer in list a and the first integer in list b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the second integer in list a and the last integer in list b, stdin contains no input. The if condition is diff1 > diff2, but since the postconditions of the if and else parts are the same, the overall postcondition remains the same regardless of the condition.**
