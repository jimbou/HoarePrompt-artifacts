Postcondition: **t is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of n integers that must have at least 3 integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, max_heap is a list containing three tuples, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 1, ans is 0, i is the third integer in the list, diff1 is the absolute difference between the third integer in list a and the first integer in list b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the third integer in list a and the last integer in list b, stdin contains no input. The number of tuples in max_heap is increased by 1 if the absolute difference between the third integer in list a and the first integer in list b is greater than the absolute difference between the third integer in list a and the last integer in list b.**
