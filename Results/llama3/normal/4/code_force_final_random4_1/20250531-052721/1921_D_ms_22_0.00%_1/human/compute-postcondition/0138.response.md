Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 2 integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers, `max_heap` is a list containing two tuples, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `i` is the second integer in the list, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second integer in list `a` and the first integer in list `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the second integer in list `a` and the last integer in list `b`, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the `max_heap` list now contains two tuples: the original tuple and a new tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`, where `-diff2` is the negative of the absolute difference between the second integer in list `a` and the last integer in list `b`, `i` is the second integer in list `a`, and `m - 1` is the index of the last integer in list `b`. The other variables remain unchanged.
