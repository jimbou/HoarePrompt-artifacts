Based on the precondition, we can determine the output of the print statement as follows:

* `t` is 0, which is not relevant to the print statement.
* `n` is 0, which is also not relevant to the print statement.
* `m` is an integer, but its value is not specified.
* `a` is an empty list, which means it has no elements.
* `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers, but the specific values are not provided.
* `max_heap` is an empty list, which is not relevant to the print statement.
* `tp1` is `m`, which is the length of list `b`.
* `tp2` is -1, which is not relevant to the print statement.
* `ans` is the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each element in `a` and either the first or last element in `b`.

Since `a` is an empty list, there are no elements to calculate the minimum absolute differences with. Therefore, the sum of these differences is 0.

Output: **0**
