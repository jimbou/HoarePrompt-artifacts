Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 integer, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers, `max_heap` is a list containing one tuple (-diff2, i, m - 1), `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `i` is the first integer in the list, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the first integer in list `a` and the first integer in list `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the first integer in list `a` and the last integer in list `b`. The absolute difference between the first integer in list `a` and the first integer in list `b` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the first integer in list `a` and the last integer in list `b`.**

In this output state, the code has pushed a tuple containing the negative of `diff2`, `i`, and `m - 1` onto the `max_heap` list. The other variables remain unchanged. The `max_heap` list now contains one element, which is a tuple representing the difference between the first integer in list `a` and the last integer in list `b`, along with the indices `i` and `m - 1`. The rest of the variables maintain their initial values and properties.
