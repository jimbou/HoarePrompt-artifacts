Output State: **t is 0, n is greater than 0, m is an integer, a is a list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, max_heap is a list containing n-1 tuples, tp1 is 0, tp2 is m - 2, ans is the original value of ans plus the absolute difference between the largest tuple in max_heap and the last integer in list b, i is the last integer in the list, diff1 is the absolute difference between the largest tuple in max_heap and the first integer in list b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the largest tuple in max_heap and the second last integer in list b, item is the largest tuple in max_heap, stdin contains no input, and the absolute difference between the largest tuple in max_heap and the first integer in list b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the largest tuple in max_heap and the second last integer in list b.**

In this output state, the value of tp2 has been decremented by 1, and the value of ans has been incremented by the absolute difference between the largest tuple in max_heap and the last integer in list b. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
