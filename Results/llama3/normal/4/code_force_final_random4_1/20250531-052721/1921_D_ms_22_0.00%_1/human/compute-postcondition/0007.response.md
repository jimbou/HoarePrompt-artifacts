Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 element, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers, `max_heap` is a list containing one tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)`, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `i` is the first element in `a`, the current value of `diff1` is the absolute difference between the first element in `a` and the first element in `b`, the current value of `diff2` is the absolute difference between the first element in `a` and the last element in `b`, and the absolute difference between the first element in `a` and the first element in `b` is greater than the absolute difference between the first element in `a` and the last element in `b`.**

In this output state, the `max_heap` list now contains a tuple with the negative value of `diff1`, the index `i` of the first element in `a`, and the index `0` of the first element in `b`. The other variables remain unchanged. The `max_heap` list is used to store tuples with the negative difference values, which allows the heap to behave as a max heap.
