Output State: **t is 0, n is greater than 0, m is an integer, a is a list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, max_heap is not empty and its size is reduced by 1, i is the last integer in the list, diff1 is the absolute difference between the first element of the largest tuple that was in max_heap and the integer at index tp1 in list b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the first element of the largest tuple that was in max_heap and the integer at index tp2 in list b, item is the largest tuple that was in max_heap but is now removed, tp1 is either 0 or 1, tp2 is either m - 2 or m - 3, and ans is the original value of ans plus the absolute difference between the largest tuple that was in max_heap and the integer at index tp2 in list b, stdin contains no input.**

In this final state, all variables retain their initial values except for tp2 and ans. The value of tp2 is decremented by 1, changing its possible values to either m - 2 or m - 3. The value of ans is incremented by diff2, which is the absolute difference between the first element of the largest tuple that was in max_heap and the integer at index tp2 in list b.
