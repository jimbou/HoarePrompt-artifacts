Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers, `max_heap` is a list of `n-1` tuples, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is `-item[0]`, `item` is the smallest tuple from the original `max_heap`, and the second element of `item` is greater than or equal to `tp1` and less than or equal to `tp2`**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to `-item[0]`, where `item[0]` is the first element of the smallest tuple from the original `max_heap`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
