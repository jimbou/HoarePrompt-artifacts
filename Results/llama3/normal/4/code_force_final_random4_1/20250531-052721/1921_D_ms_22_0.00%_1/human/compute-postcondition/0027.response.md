Output State: **t is 0, n is greater than 0, m is an integer, a is an empty list, b is a sorted list of m integers, max_heap is a list containing n - 1 tuples with the minimum absolute differences between each element in a and either the first or last element in b, tp1 is 1, tp2 is m - 1, ans is equal to the original value of ans plus the original value of diff1, item is the tuple with the smallest minimum absolute difference, the current value of diff1 is greater than the current value of diff2, where diff1 is the absolute difference between item[1] and the first element in b, and diff2 is the absolute difference between item[1] and the last element in b.**

In this output state, the value of tp1 has been incremented by 1, and the value of ans has been increased by the original value of diff1. All other variables remain unchanged.
