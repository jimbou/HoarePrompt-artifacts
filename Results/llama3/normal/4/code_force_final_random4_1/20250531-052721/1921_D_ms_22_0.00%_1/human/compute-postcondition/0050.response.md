To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of `max_heap` since it's the only variable in the loop head.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `max_heap` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `max_heap` is a non-empty list containing either `n - 2` or `n - 3` tuples. To guarantee the loop can execute again, `max_heap` must contain at least one tuple.

State: **`t`, `n`, `m` are integers, `a` is an empty list, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers, `max_heap` is a non-empty list containing at least one tuple with the minimum absolute differences between each element in `a` and either the first or last element in `b`, `item` is a tuple with the minimum absolute difference between an element in `a` and either the first or last element in `b`.**
