Postcondition: ***`t`, `n`, `m` are integers, `a` is an empty list, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers, `max_heap` is a non-empty list containing `n - 2` tuples with the minimum absolute differences between each element in `a` and either the first or last element in `b`, `item` is a tuple with the minimum absolute difference between an element in `a` and either the first or last element in `b`. If `item[2]` is equal to `tp1`, then `t` is set to 1 and `ans` is increased by the negative of the first element of `item`. Otherwise, `t` remains 0, `tp2` is decreased by 1, and `ans` is increased by the negative of the first element of `item`.***
