The only variable in the loop head is `max_heap`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on whether `max_heap` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `max_heap` is a list containing `n - 1` tuples, so for the loop to be executed one more time, `max_heap` must not be empty.

State: **`t` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is an empty list, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers, `max_heap` is a non-empty list containing `n - 1` tuples with the minimum absolute differences between each element in `a` and either the first or last element in `b`. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, then `tp1` is either 0 or 1, `tp2` is either `m - 1` or `m - 2`, and `ans` is either the original value of `ans` plus the original value of `diff1` or `diff2`. Otherwise, `tp1` is either 0 or 1, `tp2` is either `m - 1` or `m - 2`, `ans` is `-item[0]`, and the second element of `item` is greater than or equal to `tp1` and less than or equal to `tp2`. If `item[2]` is equal to `tp1`, then `tp1` is 1, otherwise `tp1` is 0 and `tp2` is `m - 2**
