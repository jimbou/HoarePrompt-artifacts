Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is an empty list, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers, `max_heap` is a non-empty list containing `n - 2` tuples with the minimum absolute differences between each element in `a` and either the first or last element in `b`, `item` is a tuple with the minimum absolute difference between an element in `a` and either the first or last element in `b`, `ans` is increased by the negative of the first element of `item`, `tp2` is decreased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `tp2` has been decremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` is still empty, `b` is still a sorted list of `m` integers, and `max_heap` still contains `n - 2` tuples with the minimum absolute differences between each element in `a` and either the first or last element in `b`. The value of `item` is still a tuple with the minimum absolute difference between an element in `a` and either the first or last element in `b`, and `ans` is still increased by the negative of the first element of `item`.
