Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is an empty list, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers, `max_heap` is a non-empty list containing `n - 2` tuples with the minimum absolute differences between each element in `a` and either the first or last element in `b`, `item` is a tuple with the minimum absolute difference between an element in `a` and either the first or last element in `b`, `ans` is increased by the negative of the first element of `item`.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` is still empty, and the list `b` is still a sorted list of `m` integers. The `max_heap` list still contains `n - 2` tuples with the minimum absolute differences between each element in `a` and either the first or last element in `b`. The `item` variable still holds a tuple with the minimum absolute difference between an element in `a` and either the first or last element in `b`. The `ans` variable has been increased by the negative of the first element of `item`, but its exact value is not specified.
