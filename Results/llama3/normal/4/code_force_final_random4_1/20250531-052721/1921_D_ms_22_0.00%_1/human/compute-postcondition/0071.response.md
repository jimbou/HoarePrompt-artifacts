Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is the first integer in the list `a`, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers, `max_heap` is a list containing one tuple (-diff2, i, m - 1), `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first integer in the list `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last integer in the list `b`, and stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `max_heap` has been updated to contain a tuple with the negative value of `diff2`, `i`, and `m - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. The `max_heap` now contains one element, which is a tuple representing the difference between `i` and the last integer in the list `b`, along with the index `i` and the index `m - 1`.
