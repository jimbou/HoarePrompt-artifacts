Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers, `max_heap` is a list of `n-3` tuples and is not empty, `ans` is updated based on the previous iteration and the smallest tuple from the original `max_heap` list, `item` is the smallest tuple from the original `max_heap` list, `ans` is increased by the negation of the first element of `item`, `tp1` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `tp1` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
