Postcondition: ***t is 0, n is greater than 0, m is an integer, a is a list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers, max_heap is not empty and its size is reduced by 1, i is the last integer in the list, diff1 is the absolute difference between the last integer in list a and the first integer in list b, diff2 is the absolute difference between the last integer in list a and the last integer in list b, item is the largest tuple that was in max_heap but is now removed, tp1 is either 0, 1 or 2, tp2 is either m - 1, m - 2 or m - 3, ans is increased by the negation of the first element of the largest tuple that was in max_heap, and stdin contains no input. If the third element of the largest tuple that was in max_heap equals tp1, then tp1 is either 1 or 2. Otherwise, tp2 is either m - 2 or m - 3. In both cases, ans is increased by the negation of the first element of the largest tuple that was in max_heap. If the absolute difference between the largest tuple that was in max_heap and the first integer in list b is greater than the absolute difference between the largest tuple that was in max_heap and the last integer in list b, then tp1 is either 1 or 2, tp2 is either m - 1 or m - 2, and the absolute difference between the largest tuple that was in max_heap and the first integer in list b is less than or equal to the current value of diff2. If the absolute difference between the largest tuple that was in max_heap and the first integer in list b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the largest tuple that was in max_heap and the last integer in list b, then tp1 is either 0 or 1, tp2 is either m - 2 or m - 3, ans is the original value of ans plus the absolute difference between the largest tuple that was in max_heap and the last integer in list b, and the absolute difference between the largest tuple that was in max_heap and the first integer in list b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the largest tuple that was in max_heap and the second last integer in list b.***
