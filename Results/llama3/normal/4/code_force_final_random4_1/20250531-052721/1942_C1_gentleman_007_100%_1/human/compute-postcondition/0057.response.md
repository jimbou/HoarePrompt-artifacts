Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of values of any type and value, `b` is a non-empty list of values of any type and value, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)`, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `j` is the length of `b`, `l` is an empty list. The value of `dp` at position `[i][j]` is not equal to the value of `dp` at position `[i][j - 1]`. The current value of `dp` at position `[i][j]` is equal to the value of `dp` at position `[i - 1][j]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged, as well as the 2D list `dp` and the empty list `l`. The value of `i` is decremented by 1, so it is now `len(a) - 1`. The value of `j` remains the same, which is the length of `b`. The relationship between the values of `dp` at positions `[i][j]`, `[i][j - 1]`, and `[i - 1][j]` remains the same.
