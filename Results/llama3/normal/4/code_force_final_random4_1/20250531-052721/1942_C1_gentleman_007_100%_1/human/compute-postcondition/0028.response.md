Output State: **ver is the leftmost node in the deque q before the execution, q is a deque with its leftmost node removed and node appended, graph is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes, vis is a list or dictionary where vis[i] represents whether node i has been visited or not, with all nodes in the graph marked as visited, except for node which is now marked as visited, and graph[ver] must not be empty, and node is the third neighboring node of ver.**

The code appends the node to the deque q and marks it as visited in the vis list or dictionary. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
