The function calculates the modular exponentiation of a number 'a' raised to the power of 'b' under modulo 'mod'. It takes three integers as input: 'a', 'b', and 'mod', where 'a' and 'b' are non-negative and 'mod' is non-zero. The function returns the remainder of 'a' raised to the power of 'b' divided by 'mod', effectively computing (a^b) % mod.
