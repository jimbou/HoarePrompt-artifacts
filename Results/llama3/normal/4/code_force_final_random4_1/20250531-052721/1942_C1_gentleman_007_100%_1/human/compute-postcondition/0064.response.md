Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of values of any type and value, `b` is a non-empty list of values of any type and value, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)`, `i` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is greater than 0**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been decremented by 1, so it is now greater than or equal to 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
