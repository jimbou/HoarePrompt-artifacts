Output State: **`a` is a list of values of any type and value, `b` is a list of values of any type and value, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1). For all i and j, if `a[i - 1]` is equal to `b[j - 1]`, then `dp[i][j]` is `dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1`. Otherwise, `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i - 1][j]` and `dp[i][j - 1]`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that `dp` will contain the lengths of the longest common subsequences between all prefixes of `a` and `b`. Specifically, `dp[i][j]` will be the length of the longest common subsequence between the first `i` elements of `a` and the first `j` elements of `b`.
