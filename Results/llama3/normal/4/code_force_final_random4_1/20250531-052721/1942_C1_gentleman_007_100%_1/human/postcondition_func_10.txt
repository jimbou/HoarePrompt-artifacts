The function accepts a non-negative integer `num` and returns a list of all prime numbers less than or equal to `num`. The function identifies prime numbers by iteratively marking multiples of each prime number starting from 2, and then collects all the prime numbers into a list. The function does not modify the input `num` and only uses it to determine the range of numbers to check for primality.
