The code prints the value of `ver`, which is the leftmost node in the deque `q` before the execution, followed by a space. Since `ver` is the leftmost node in the deque `q` before the execution, its value is the node that was removed from the deque `q` before the print statement.

Output: **the leftmost node in the deque q before the execution (which is the node that was removed from the deque q before the print statement)**
