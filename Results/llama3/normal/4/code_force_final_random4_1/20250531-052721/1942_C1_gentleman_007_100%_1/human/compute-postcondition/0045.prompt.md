Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ver` is the new leftmost node in the deque `q`, `q` is a deque with its leftmost node removed and q must not be empty, `graph` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes, `vis` is a list or dictionary where `vis[i]` represents whether node `i` has been visited or not, with all nodes in the graph marked as visited, `graph[ver]` must not be empty, and `node` is the last neighboring node of the previous `ver`, and the new leftmost node `ver` is being printed
Code of the loop:
for node in graph[ver]:
    if not vis[node]:
        q.append(node)
        vis[node] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`ver` is the new leftmost node in the deque `q`, `q` is a deque with its leftmost node removed and q must not be empty, `graph` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes, `vis` is a list or dictionary where `vis[i]` represents whether node `i` has been visited or not. If `node` has not been visited, `q` is a deque with the node appended to its right side, `vis[node]` is 1, and `ver` is the new leftmost node in the deque `q`. Otherwise, the state of `q`, `vis`, and `ver` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *ver is the new leftmost node in the deque q, q is a deque with its leftmost node removed and q must not be empty, graph is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes, vis is a list or dictionary where vis[i] represents whether node i has been visited or not. If node has not been visited, node is appended to q and vis[node] is 1. If node has been visited, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`ver` is the new leftmost node in the deque `q`, `q` is a deque with its leftmost node removed and `q` must not be empty, `graph` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes, `vis` is a list or dictionary where `vis[i]` represents whether node `i` has been visited or not. If a neighboring node of `ver` hasn't been visited yet, the deque `q` now has an additional node at the end, `vis[node]` is marked as visited (1), and all other variables remain unchanged. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
