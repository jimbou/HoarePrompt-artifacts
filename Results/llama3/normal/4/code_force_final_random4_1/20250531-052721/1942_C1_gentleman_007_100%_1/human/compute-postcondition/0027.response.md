The only variables in the loop head are variables  node and graph[ver], so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `graph[ver]`. If `graph[ver]` has at least 3 neighboring nodes the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `graph[ver]` has at least 2 neighboring nodes, node is the second neighboring node of `ver`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the `graph[ver]` must have at least 3 neighboring nodes and the node is the third neighboring node of `ver`.
State: **`ver` is the leftmost node in the deque `q` before the execution, `q` is a deque with its leftmost node removed, `graph` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes, `vis` is a list or dictionary where `vis[i]` represents whether node `i` has been visited or not, with all nodes in the graph marked as visited, `graph[ver]` must not be empty, and `node` is the third neighboring node of `ver`.**
