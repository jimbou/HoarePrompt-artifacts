Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of values of any type and value, `b` is a non-empty list of values of any type and value, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)`, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is greater than 0 and equals to the previous value of `j` minus 1.**

In this output state, the value of `j` has been decremented by 1, but it is still greater than 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
