Output State: **`a` is a list of values of any type and value that must have at least 2 elements, `b` is a list of values of any type and value, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1). If the current element of `a` is equal to the current element of `b`, then `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1`. Otherwise, `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i - 1][j]` and `dp[i][j - 1]`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the 2D list `dp` will have its elements updated based on the comparison of the elements of `a` and `b`. If the current elements of `a` and `b` are equal, the corresponding element in `dp` will be incremented by 1. Otherwise, the element in `dp` will be the maximum of the elements above and to the left of it. The lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
