Output State: **q is a deque with the node appended to its right side, vis[node] is 1, ver is the new leftmost node in the deque q, q is a deque with its leftmost node removed and q must not be empty, graph is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes, graph[ver] must have at least 1 neighboring node, and node is the first neighboring node in the list.**

In this final state, the deque `q` has been modified by appending the `node` to its right side. The `vis` dictionary has also been updated, marking the `node` as visited by setting `vis[node]` to 1. All other variables, including `ver`, `graph`, and the properties of `q`, remain unchanged.
