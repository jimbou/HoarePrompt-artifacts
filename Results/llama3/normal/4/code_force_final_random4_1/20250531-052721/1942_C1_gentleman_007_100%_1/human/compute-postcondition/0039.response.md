The only object in the loop head is variable  node and graph and ver, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the graph and ver.  If the graph has at least 2 nodes the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, graph is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes, ver is the new leftmost node in the deque q, q is a deque with its leftmost node removed and q must not be empty. So for the loop to be executed one more time the graph must have at least 2 nodes and the ver is the new leftmost node in the deque q and node is the second node in the list of neighboring nodes of ver.
State: **`ver` is the new leftmost node in the deque `q`, `q` is a deque with its leftmost node removed and q must not be empty, `graph` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes, `vis` is a list or dictionary where `vis[i]` represents whether node `i` has been visited or not, node is the second node in the list of neighboring nodes of ver**
