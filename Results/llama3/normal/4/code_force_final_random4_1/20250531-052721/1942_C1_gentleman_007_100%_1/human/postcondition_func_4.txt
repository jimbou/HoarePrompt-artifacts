This function generates a list of n+1 lists, where each inner list represents a node in a graph, and populates it with m number of edges. The function accepts a positive integer n and a non-negative integer m (where m <= n) as inputs, and returns a list of n+1 lists where each index x contains a list of neighboring nodes y, and vice versa. The function effectively constructs an undirected graph with n nodes and m edges.
