This function performs a binary search on a sorted list of integers to find the position of a target value. It accepts a sorted list of integers and a target integer as input. If the target value is greater than the last element in the list, the function returns the length of the list. Otherwise, it returns the index of the left boundary of the search range where the target value should be inserted to maintain the sorted order.
