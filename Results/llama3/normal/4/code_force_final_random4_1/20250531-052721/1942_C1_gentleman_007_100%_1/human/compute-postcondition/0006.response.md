Postcondition: ***`ver` is assigned the value of the leftmost node in the deque `q`, `graph` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes, `q` is a deque containing nodes in the graph with the leftmost node removed, `vis` is a list or dictionary where `vis[i]` represents whether node `i` has been visited or not, with `vis[ver]` being 1, `graph[ver]` must not be empty, and node is the first neighboring node of `ver` in the graph. The current value of `vis[node]` is 0, indicating that node has not been visited.***
