Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of values of any type and value, `b` is a non-empty list of values of any type and value, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)`, `i` is the length of `a`, `j` is the length of `b` minus one, `l` is an empty list. The current value of `dp[i][j]` is equal to the current value of `dp[i][j - 1]`**

In this output state, the value of `j` has been decremented by 1, but the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The dimensions of the 2D list `dp` and the lengths of the lists `a` and `b` are still the same. The relationship between the current value of `dp[i][j]` and `dp[i][j - 1]` is still valid, but now `j` is one less than its original value.
