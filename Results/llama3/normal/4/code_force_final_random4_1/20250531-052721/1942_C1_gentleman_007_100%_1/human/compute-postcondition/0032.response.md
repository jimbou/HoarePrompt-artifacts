Output State: **`ver` is the new leftmost node in the deque `q`, `q` is a deque with its leftmost node removed and q must not be empty, `graph` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes, `vis` is a list or dictionary where `vis[i]` represents whether node `i` has been visited or not, with all nodes in the graph marked as visited, `graph[ver]` must not be empty, and `node` is the last neighboring node of the previous `ver`.**

In this output state, the value of `ver` has been updated to the new leftmost node in the deque `q`, which was previously the second node from the left. The deque `q` has been modified by removing its leftmost node, but it is still not empty. The graph and the visited nodes remain unchanged. The last neighboring node of the previous `ver` is still stored in the variable `node`.
