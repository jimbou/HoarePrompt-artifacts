Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ver` is assigned the value of the leftmost node in the deque `q`, `graph` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes, `q` is a deque containing nodes in the graph with the leftmost node removed, and `vis` is a list or dictionary where `vis[i]` represents whether node `i` has been visited or not, with `vis[ver]` being 1, and the value of `ver` which is the leftmost node in the deque `q` is printed
Code of the loop:
for node in graph[ver]:
    if not vis[node]:
        q.append(node)
        vis[node] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *ver is assigned the value of the leftmost node in the deque q, graph is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes, q is a deque containing nodes in the graph with the leftmost node removed and node appended to it if node has not been visited before, otherwise q remains unchanged, vis is a list or dictionary where vis[i] represents whether node i has been visited or not, with vis[ver] being 1 and vis[node] being 1 if node has not been visited before, otherwise vis[node] remains unchanged, graph[ver] must not be empty, and node is the first neighboring node of ver in the graph.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *ver is assigned the value of the leftmost node in the deque q, graph is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes, q is a deque containing nodes in the graph, vis is a list or dictionary where vis[i] represents whether node i has been visited or not. If the second neighboring node of ver in the graph has not been visited, then it is appended to the deque q and marked as visited. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *ver is assigned the value of the leftmost node in the deque q, graph is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes, q is a deque containing nodes in the graph, vis is a list or dictionary where vis[i] represents whether node i has been visited or not. If node has not been visited, then node is appended to q and vis[node] is set to 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
