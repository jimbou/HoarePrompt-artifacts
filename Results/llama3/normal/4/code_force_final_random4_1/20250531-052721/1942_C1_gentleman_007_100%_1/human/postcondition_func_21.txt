This function takes two lists of values as input, 'a' and 'b', and returns a string containing the elements of list 'a' in their original order, concatenated into a single string. The function performs a dynamic programming operation to compute the longest common subsequence between 'a' and 'b', but the result of this operation is not returned. Instead, the function constructs a list 'l' containing the elements of 'a' in reverse order, joins them into a string 's', and returns the reversed string 's'. The input lists 'a' and 'b' are not modified by the function.
