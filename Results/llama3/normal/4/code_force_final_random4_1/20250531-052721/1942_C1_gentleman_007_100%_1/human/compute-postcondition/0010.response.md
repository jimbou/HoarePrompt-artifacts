Output State: **ver is assigned the value of the leftmost node in the deque q, graph is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes, q is a deque containing nodes in the graph with the second neighboring node of ver appended to it, vis is a list or dictionary where vis[i] represents whether node i has been visited or not, with vis[node] set to 1, and node is the second neighboring node of ver in the graph.**

The code appends the second neighboring node of `ver` to the deque `q` and marks it as visited by setting `vis[node]` to 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
