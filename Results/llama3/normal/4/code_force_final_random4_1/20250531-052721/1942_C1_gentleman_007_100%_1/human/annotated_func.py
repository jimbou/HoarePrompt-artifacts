#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates the modular exponentiation of a number 'a' raised to the power of 'b' under modulo 'mod'. It takes three integers as input: 'a', 'b', and 'mod', where 'a' and 'b' are non-negative and 'mod' is non-zero. The function returns the remainder of 'a' raised to the power of 'b' divided by 'mod', effectively computing (a^b) % mod.

For all i and j, if `a[i - 1]` is equal to `b[j - 1]`, then `dp[i][j]` is `dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1`. Otherwise, `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i - 1][j]` and `dp[i][j - 1]`.

    #The program returns a string containing the elements of list 'a' in their original order, concatenated into a single string.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes two lists of values as input, 'a' and 'b', and returns a string containing the elements of list 'a' in their original order, concatenated into a single string. The function performs a dynamic programming operation to compute the longest common subsequence between 'a' and 'b', but the result of this operation is not returned. Instead, the function constructs a list 'l' containing the elements of 'a' in reverse order, joins them into a string 's', and returns the reversed string 's'. The input lists 'a' and 'b' are not modified by the function.

    return len(l)
    #The program returns the length of list 'l' which contains all elements from list 'arr' inserted in sorted order.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of integers as input, inserts all elements from the input list into a new list in sorted order, and returns the length of the sorted list. The input list remains unchanged. The function effectively counts the number of unique elements in the input list, as duplicates are overwritten during the insertion process.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function performs a depth-first search (DFS) traversal of a graph, starting from a given vertex, and marks all visited vertices. It prints the visited vertices in the order they are visited, updates the visitation status of each vertex, and leaves the graph unchanged. The function returns no value but modifies the visitation status of vertices in the graph.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function performs a breadth-first traversal of a graph, starting from a given node, and marks all visited nodes. It prints the visited nodes in the order they are traversed and updates the visitation status of each node. The graph structure remains unchanged.
