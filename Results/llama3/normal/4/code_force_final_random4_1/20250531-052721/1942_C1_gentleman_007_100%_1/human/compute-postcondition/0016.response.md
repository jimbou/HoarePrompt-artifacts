The variable in the loop head is q, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable q. If q is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, q is an empty deque, so for the loop to be executed one more time q must not be empty.
State: **ver is assigned the value of the leftmost node in the deque q, graph is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes, q is not empty, vis is a list or dictionary where vis[i] represents whether node i has been visited or not, with all nodes in the graph marked as visited**
