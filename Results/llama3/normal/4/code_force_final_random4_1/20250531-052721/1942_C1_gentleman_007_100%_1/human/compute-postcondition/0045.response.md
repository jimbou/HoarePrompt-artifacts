Output State: **`ver` is the new leftmost node in the deque `q`, `q` is a deque with its leftmost node removed and `q` must not be empty, `graph` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes, `vis` is a list or dictionary where `vis[i]` represents whether node `i` has been visited or not. All neighboring nodes of `ver` have been visited, `q` contains all unvisited neighboring nodes of `ver`, and `vis[node]` is 1 for all neighboring nodes of `ver`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that the deque `q` now contains all the neighboring nodes of `ver` that have not been visited yet, and all neighboring nodes of `ver` have been marked as visited in the `vis` list or dictionary. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
