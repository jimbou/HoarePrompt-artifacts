Postcondition: ***`ver` is the new leftmost node in the deque `q`, `q` is a deque with its leftmost node removed and `q` must not be empty, `graph` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes, `vis` is a list or dictionary where `vis[i]` represents whether node `i` has been visited or not. If a neighboring node of `ver` hasn't been visited yet, the deque `q` now has an additional node at the end, `vis[node]` is marked as visited (1), and all other variables remain unchanged. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
