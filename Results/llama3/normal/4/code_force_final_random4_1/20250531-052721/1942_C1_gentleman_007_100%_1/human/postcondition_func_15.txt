Functionality: This function generates a list of integers based on the input parameters 'n' and 'mod'. If 'mod' is -1, the function creates a list containing the integers 1, 0, and a sequence of numbers where each number is the product of the previous two numbers plus the previous number, starting from 1 and 0. If 'mod' is a positive integer, the function creates a list containing the integers 1, 0, and a sequence of numbers where each number is the result of the expression ((i - 1) % mod * (dearr[i - 1] + dearr[i - 2]) % mod % mod) for i in range(2, n + 1). The length of the returned list is always 'n + 1'.
