Postcondition: ***`ver` is the leftmost node in the deque `q` before the execution, `q` is a deque with its leftmost node removed, `graph` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes, `vis` is a list or dictionary where `vis[i]` represents whether node `i` has been visited or not, with all nodes in the graph marked as visited, `graph[ver]` must not be empty, and `node` is the first neighboring node of `ver`. If `node` has not been visited, `q` is updated by appending `node` to it and `node` is marked as visited. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
