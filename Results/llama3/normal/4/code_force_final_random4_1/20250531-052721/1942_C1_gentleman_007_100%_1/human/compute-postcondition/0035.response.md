According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `graph` and `ver`. If `graph[ver]` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `ver` is the new leftmost node in the deque `q`, `q` is a deque with its leftmost node removed and q must not be empty, `graph` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes, `vis` is a list or dictionary where `vis[i]` represents whether node `i` has been visited or not, with all nodes in the graph marked as visited, `graph[ver]` must not be empty, and `node` is the last neighboring node of the previous `ver`, and the new leftmost node `ver` is being printed. So for the loop to be executed  the `graph[ver]` must have at least 1 neighboring node and the node is the first neighboring node in the list.
State: **`ver` is the new leftmost node in the deque `q`, `q` is a deque with its leftmost node removed and q must not be empty, `graph` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes, `vis` is a list or dictionary where `vis[i]` represents whether node `i` has been visited or not, with all nodes in the graph marked as visited, `graph[ver]` must have at least 1 neighboring node, and `node` is the first neighboring node in the list**
