To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `node` and `graph[ver]`. The loop will execute if `graph[ver]` is not empty, meaning the node `ver` has at least one neighboring node. 

Since all nodes in the graph are marked as visited, we can assume that the node `ver` has been visited. However, this does not affect the execution of the loop.

The state of `q` is not relevant to the execution of the loop, as it is not used in the loop head. The state of `vis` is also not relevant, as it is not used in the loop head.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

State: **`ver` is the leftmost node in the deque `q` before the execution, `q` is a deque with its leftmost node removed, `graph` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes, `vis` is a list or dictionary where `vis[i]` represents whether node `i` has been visited or not, with all nodes in the graph marked as visited, `graph[ver]` must not be empty, and `node` is the first neighboring node of `ver`**
