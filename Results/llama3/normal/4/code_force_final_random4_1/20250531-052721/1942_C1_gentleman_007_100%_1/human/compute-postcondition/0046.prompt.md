Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: ver is a node in the graph, graph is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes, q is a deque containing the node ver, and vis is a list or dictionary where vis[i] represents whether node i has been visited or not, with vis[ver] being 1.
Code of the loop:
while len(q):
    ver = q.popleft()
    print(ver, end=' ')
    for node in graph[ver]:
        if not vis[node]:
            q.append(node)
            vis[node] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: ver is assigned the value of the leftmost node in the deque q, graph is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes, q is an empty deque, vis is a list or dictionary where vis[i] represents whether node i has been visited or not, with all nodes in the graph marked as visited.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `ver` is the leftmost node in the deque `q` before the execution, `q` is a deque with its leftmost node removed, `graph` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes, `vis` is a list or dictionary where `vis[i]` represents whether node `i` has been visited or not, with all nodes in the graph marked as visited, `graph[ver]` must not be empty, and `node` is the last neighboring node of `ver`. If `node` has not been visited, `q` is updated by appending `node` to the end and removing its leftmost node, `vis[node]` is marked as visited. Otherwise, no changes are made to `q` and `vis`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `ver` is the new leftmost node in the deque `q`, `q` is a deque with its leftmost node removed and `q` must not be empty, `graph` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes, `vis` is a list or dictionary where `vis[i]` represents whether node `i` has been visited or not. All neighboring nodes of `ver` have been visited, `q` contains all unvisited neighboring nodes of `ver`, and `vis[node]` is 1 for all neighboring nodes of `ver`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
