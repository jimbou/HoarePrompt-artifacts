Output State: **ver is a node in the graph, graph is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes, q is a deque containing the node ver, and vis is a list or dictionary where vis[i] represents whether node i has been visited or not, with vis[ver] being 1.**

In this final state, the code has added a new deque `q` and appended the node `ver` to it. The `vis` data structure, which tracks the visitation status of nodes, has been updated to mark the node `ver` as visited (indicated by `vis[ver] = 1`). The graph and the node `ver` remain unchanged.
