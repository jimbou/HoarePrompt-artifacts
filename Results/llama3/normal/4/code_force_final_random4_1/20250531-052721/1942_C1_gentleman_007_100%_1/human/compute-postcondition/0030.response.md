Output State: **`ver` is the leftmost node in the deque `q` before the execution, `q` is a deque with its leftmost node removed, `graph` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes, `vis` is a list or dictionary where `vis[i]` represents whether node `i` has been visited or not, with all nodes in the graph marked as visited, `graph[ver]` must not be empty, and `node` is the last neighboring node of `ver`. If `node` has not been visited, `q` is updated by appending `node` to the end and removing its leftmost node, `vis[node]` is marked as visited. Otherwise, no changes are made to `q` and `vis`.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the leftmost node `ver` in the deque `q` before the execution is updated to be the last neighboring node of `ver`. The deque `q` is updated by appending the last neighboring node of `ver` to the end and removing its leftmost node if the last neighboring node has not been visited. The list or dictionary `vis` is updated by marking the last neighboring node of `ver` as visited if it has not been visited. The graph `graph` remains unchanged.
