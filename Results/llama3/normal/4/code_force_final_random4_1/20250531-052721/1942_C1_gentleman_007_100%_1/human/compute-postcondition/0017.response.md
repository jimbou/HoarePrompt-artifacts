The value of `ver` is assigned the value of the leftmost node in the deque `q`. The value of the leftmost node in the deque `q` is removed from `q`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The graph is still a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes. The variable `vis` is still a list or dictionary where `vis[i]` represents whether node `i` has been visited or not, with all nodes in the graph marked as visited. The deque `q` is not empty and its leftmost node has been removed.

Output State: **`ver` is the leftmost node in the deque `q` before the execution, `q` is a deque with its leftmost node removed, `graph` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes, `vis` is a list or dictionary where `vis[i]` represents whether node `i` has been visited or not, with all nodes in the graph marked as visited**
