This function takes a positive integer `num` and a list of prime numbers `Prime_array` as input, where each index `i` in `Prime_array` is a multiple of the prime number at that index. The function then performs prime factorization on `num` using the prime numbers in `Prime_array`, and returns a dictionary `d` containing the prime factors of `num` as keys and their respective counts as values. The function ensures that `num` is reduced to 1 through this process, and the resulting dictionary `d` contains at least one key-value pair, where each key is a prime number and each value is greater than or equal to 1.
