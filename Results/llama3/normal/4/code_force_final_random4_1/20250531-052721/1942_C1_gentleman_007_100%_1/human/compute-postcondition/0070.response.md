Output State: **`a` and `b` are non-empty lists of values of any type and value, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)`, `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and `j` is greater than 0**

In this output state, the values of `a`, `b`, and `dp` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is decremented by 1, so it is now greater than or equal to 0, but still an integer. The value of `j` remains greater than 0.
