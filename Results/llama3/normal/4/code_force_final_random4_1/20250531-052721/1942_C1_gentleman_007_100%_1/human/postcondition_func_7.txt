This function takes a 2D list of integers as input and returns a new 2D list of integers, where each element is the sum of the corresponding element in the input list and the sums of the elements above and to the left of it in the output list. The returned list has dimensions (n+1) x (m+1), where n and m are the dimensions of the input list. The function effectively computes a cumulative sum of the input list, with the top-left element of the output list being 0.
