Output State: **ver is assigned the value of the leftmost node in the deque q, graph is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes, q is an empty deque, vis is a list or dictionary where vis[i] represents whether node i has been visited or not, with all nodes in the graph marked as visited.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state is such that the variable `ver` is assigned the value of the leftmost node in the deque `q`, the graph remains unchanged, the deque `q` is empty, and all nodes in the graph have been marked as visited in the `vis` list or dictionary. This indicates that the loop has traversed all nodes in the graph and marked them as visited, resulting in an empty deque `q` and a fully visited graph.
