Output State: **`ver` is the leftmost node in the deque `q` before the execution, `q` is a deque with its leftmost node removed and the node `node` appended to it, `graph` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes, `vis` is a list or dictionary where `vis[i]` represents whether node `i` has been visited or not, with all nodes in the graph marked as visited except for the node `node` which is now marked as visited, and `node` is the first neighboring node of `ver`.**

In this output state, the value of `ver` remains unchanged as it was the leftmost node in the deque `q` before the execution. The deque `q` has been modified by removing its leftmost node and appending the node `node` to it. The `graph` remains unchanged as it is a dictionary representing the neighboring nodes for each node. The `vis` list or dictionary has been updated to mark the node `node` as visited, while all other nodes in the graph remain marked as visited.
