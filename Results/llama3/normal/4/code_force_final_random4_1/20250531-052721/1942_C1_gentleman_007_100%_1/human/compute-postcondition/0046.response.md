Output State: **The loop has finished executing, and the deque q is empty. All nodes in the graph have been visited, and the vis list or dictionary reflects this. The graph dictionary remains unchanged.**

In natural language, this means that the loop has completed its execution, and all nodes in the graph have been visited. The deque q is now empty, indicating that there are no more nodes to visit. The vis list or dictionary accurately reflects the visited state of all nodes in the graph. The graph dictionary remains unchanged, as it only provides the neighboring nodes for each node and does not change during the loop's execution.
