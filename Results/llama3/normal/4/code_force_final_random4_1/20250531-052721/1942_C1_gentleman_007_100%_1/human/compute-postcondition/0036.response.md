Postcondition: ***`ver` is the new leftmost node in the deque `q`, `q` is a deque with its leftmost node removed and q must not be empty, `graph` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes, `vis` is a list or dictionary where `vis[i]` represents whether node `i` has been visited or not, with all nodes in the graph marked as visited, `graph[ver]` must have at least 1 neighboring node, and `node` is the first neighboring node in the list. The current value of `vis[node]` is False, indicating that node has not been visited.***
