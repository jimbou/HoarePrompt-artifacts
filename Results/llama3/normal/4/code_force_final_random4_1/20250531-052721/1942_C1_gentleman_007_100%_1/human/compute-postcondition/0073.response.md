Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are non-empty lists of values of any type and value, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)`. If `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, then `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise, if `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i - 1][j]`, then `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and `j` is greater than 0. Otherwise, `i` and `j` are decreased by 1, and a list `l` is created containing the value at index `i` of list `a`.***
