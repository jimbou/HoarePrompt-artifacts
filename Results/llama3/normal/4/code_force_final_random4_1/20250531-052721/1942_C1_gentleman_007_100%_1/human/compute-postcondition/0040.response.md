Output State: **ver is the new leftmost node in the deque q, q is a deque with its leftmost node removed and q must not be empty and node is appended to q, graph is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes, vis is a list or dictionary where vis[i] represents whether node i has been visited or not and vis[node] is 1**

In this output state, the deque `q` has been modified by appending the `node` to it, and the `vis` list or dictionary has been updated to mark the `node` as visited by setting `vis[node]` to 1. The other variables, `ver` and `graph`, remain unchanged.
