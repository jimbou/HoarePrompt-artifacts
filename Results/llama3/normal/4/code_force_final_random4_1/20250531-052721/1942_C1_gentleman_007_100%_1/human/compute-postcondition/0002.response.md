Output State: **`ver` is assigned the value of the leftmost node in the deque `q`, `graph` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes, `q` is a deque containing nodes in the graph with the leftmost node removed, and `vis` is a list or dictionary where `vis[i]` represents whether node `i` has been visited or not, with `vis[ver]` being 1**

In this output state, the value of `ver` has been updated to the leftmost node in the deque `q`, which was previously the node `ver`. The deque `q` has been updated by removing its leftmost node. The other variables, `graph` and `vis`, remain unchanged.
