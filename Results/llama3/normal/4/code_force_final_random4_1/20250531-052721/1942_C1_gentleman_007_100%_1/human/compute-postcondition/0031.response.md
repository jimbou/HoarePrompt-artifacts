The variable in the loop head is variable q, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable q.  If q is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, q is a deque with its leftmost node removed. So for the loop to be executed one more time q must not be empty.
State: **`ver` is the leftmost node in the deque `q` before the execution, `q` is a deque with its leftmost node removed and q must not be empty, `graph` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes, `vis` is a list or dictionary where `vis[i]` represents whether node `i` has been visited or not, with all nodes in the graph marked as visited, `graph[ver]` must not be empty, and `node` is the last neighboring node of `ver`.**
