Output State: **ver is assigned the value of the leftmost node in the deque q, graph is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes, q is a deque containing nodes in the graph with the leftmost node removed and node appended to it, vis is a list or dictionary where vis[i] represents whether node i has been visited or not, with vis[ver] being 1 and vis[node] being 1, graph[ver] must not be empty, and node is the first neighboring node of ver in the graph.**

In this final state, the value of `ver` remains unchanged as it was assigned the value of the leftmost node in the deque `q` before the code execution. The `graph` also remains unchanged as it is a dictionary representing the neighboring nodes for each node, and no modifications were made to it.

The deque `q` has been modified by appending the `node` to it. Initially, the leftmost node was removed from `q`, and now `node` has been added to the end of `q`.

The `vis` list or dictionary has been updated to reflect that `node` has been visited. Initially, `vis[ver]` was 1, indicating that `ver` had been visited, and now `vis[node]` is also 1, indicating that `node` has been visited.

The fact that `graph[ver]` must not be empty and `node` is the first neighboring node of `ver` in the graph remains valid as these conditions were not affected by the code execution.
