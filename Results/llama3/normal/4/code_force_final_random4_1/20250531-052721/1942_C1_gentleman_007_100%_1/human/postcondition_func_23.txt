The function performs a depth-first search (DFS) traversal of a graph, starting from a given vertex, and marks all visited vertices. It prints the visited vertices in the order they are visited, updates the visitation status of each vertex, and leaves the graph unchanged. The function returns no value but modifies the visitation status of vertices in the graph.
