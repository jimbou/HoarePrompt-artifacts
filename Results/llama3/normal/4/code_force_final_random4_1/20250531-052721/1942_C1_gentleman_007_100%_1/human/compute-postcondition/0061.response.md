Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-empty list of values of any type and value, `b` is a non-empty list of values of any type and value, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)`. If the current value of `dp` at position `[i][j]` is equal to the value of `dp` at position `[i][j - 1]`, then `j` is the length of `b` minus one. Otherwise, if the current value of `dp` at position `[i][j]` is equal to the value of `dp` at position `[i - 1][j]`, then `i` is `len(a) - 1`. Otherwise, `i` is the second last index of `a`, `j` is the second last index of `b`, and `l` is a list containing the last element of `a`.***
