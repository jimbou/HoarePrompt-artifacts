Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is a list of values of any type and value, b is a list of values of any type and value, dp is a 2D list with dimensions (len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1), i is the length of a, j is the length of b, l is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
while i != 0 and j != 0:
    if dp[i][j] == dp[i][j - 1]:
        j -= 1
    elif dp[i][j] == dp[i - 1][j]:
        i -= 1
    else:
        i -= 1
        j -= 1
        l.append(a[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is a non-empty list of values of any type and value, `b` is a non-empty list of values of any type and value, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)`. If the current value of `dp` at position `[i][j]` is equal to the value of `dp` at position `[i][j - 1]`, then `j` is the length of `b` minus one. Otherwise, if the current value of `dp` at position `[i][j]` is equal to the value of `dp` at position `[i - 1][j]`, then `i` is `len(a) - 1`. Otherwise, `i` is the second last index of `a`, `j` is the second last index of `b`, and `l` is a list containing the last element of `a`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`a` and `b` are non-empty lists of values of any type and value, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)`. If `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, then `j` is greater than 0 and equals to the previous value of `j` minus 1. Otherwise, if `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i - 1][j]`, then `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and `j` is greater than 0. Otherwise, `i` and `j` are both decreased by 1, and a list `l` is created containing the value at index `i` of list `a`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`a` and `b` are non-empty lists of values of any type and value, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)`. If `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, then `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise, if `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i - 1][j]`, then `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and `j` is greater than 0. Otherwise, `i` and `j` are decreased by 1, and a list `l` is created containing the value at index `i` of list `a`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
