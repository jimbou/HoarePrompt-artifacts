Output State: **ver is assigned the value of the leftmost node in the deque q, graph is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes, q is a deque containing nodes in the graph with node appended to it, vis is a list or dictionary where vis[i] represents whether node i has been visited or not, and vis[node] is 1, node is the next neighboring node of ver in the list graph[ver].**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line appends the value of `node` to the deque `q`. This means that `q` now contains all the nodes it had initially, plus the additional node. The second line assigns the value 1 to `vis[node]`, indicating that the node has been visited. The values of `ver`, `graph`, and the original contents of `q` and `vis` remain unchanged.
