Postcondition: ***`ver` is the new leftmost node in the deque `q`, `q` is a deque with its leftmost node removed and q must not be empty, `graph` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of neighboring nodes, `vis` is a list or dictionary where `vis[i]` represents whether node `i` has been visited or not. If `node` has not been visited, `q` is a deque with the node appended to its right side, `vis[node]` is 1, and `ver` is the new leftmost node in the deque `q`. Otherwise, the state of `q`, `vis`, and `ver` remains unchanged.***
