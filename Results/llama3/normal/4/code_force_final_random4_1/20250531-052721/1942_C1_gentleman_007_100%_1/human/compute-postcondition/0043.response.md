Output State: **The deque `q` now has an additional node at the end, `vis[node]` is marked as visited (1), and all other variables remain unchanged.**

In this output state, the deque `q` has been modified by appending a new node to its end. The `vis` data structure, which keeps track of visited nodes, has been updated to mark the newly added node as visited (represented by the value 1). The values of `ver`, `graph`, and the rest of the `vis` data structure remain unchanged, as they were not affected by the executed code.
