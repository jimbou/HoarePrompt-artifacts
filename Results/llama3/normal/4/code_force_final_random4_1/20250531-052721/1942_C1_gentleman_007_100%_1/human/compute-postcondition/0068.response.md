According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and `j` is greater than 0. However, this does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so they need to be adjusted to `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`a` and `b` are non-empty lists of values of any type and value, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)`, `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than 0**
