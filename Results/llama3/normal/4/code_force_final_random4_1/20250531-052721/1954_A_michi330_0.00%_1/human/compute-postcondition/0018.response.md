Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `itest` is 2, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers between 1 and 50, inclusive, with 1 <= m, k <= n, and stdin contains `t-5` lines.**

The code reads a line from the input, which contains three integers separated by spaces, and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k`, respectively. The values of `t` and `itest` remain unchanged. The condition 1 <= m, k <= n is still valid, and the range of `n`, `m`, and `k` is still between 1 and 50, inclusive. The stdin now contains `t-5` lines, since one line has been read.
