Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers between 1 and 50, inclusive, with 1 <= m, k <= n, `itest` is 0, and stdin contains `t-1` lines. If `n` is less than or equal to `k`, or the difference between `n` and the ceiling of `n` divided by `m` is less than `k`, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, if `n` is greater than `k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is greater than or equal to `k`, then 'Yes' is printed.***
