Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it's possible for Alice to paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.

The given program uses the following logic:

- If the number of parts (n) is less than or equal to the number of parts Bob can repaint (k), or
- If the number of parts minus the ceiling of the number of parts divided by the number of colors (m) is less than k,

then it prints 'NO', indicating that it's not possible for Alice to paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.

Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.

This logic is correct because:

- If n <= k, then Bob can simply repaint all parts to make them the same color.
- If n - math.ceil(n / m) < k, then Bob can repaint the remaining parts to make them the same color as the majority color.

The program correctly handles the edge cases and the logic is sound.

Correctness: **True**
