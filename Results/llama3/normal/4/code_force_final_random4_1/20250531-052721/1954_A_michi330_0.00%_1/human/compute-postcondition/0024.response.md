Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `itest` is `t-1`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers between 1 and 50, inclusive, with 1 <= m, k <= n, and stdin contains 0 lines. If `n` is less than or equal to `k` or `n` minus the ceiling of `n` divided by `m` is less than `k`, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'Yes' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the value of `itest` is one less than the initial value of `t`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are still integers between 1 and 50, inclusive, with 1 <= m, k <= n. The stdin contains 0 lines, indicating that all input has been processed. The loop's conditional statement still determines whether to print 'NO' or 'Yes' based on the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
