The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads a line from the standard input, splits it into three integers, and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`, respectively.

Initially, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and stdin contains `t` lines, each containing three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` (1 <= m, k <= n <= 50). The variable `itest` is 0.

After executing the code, the first line from stdin is read and split into three integers, which are assigned to `n`, `m`, and `k`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are now integers between 1 and 50, inclusive, with 1 <= m, k <= n.

The value of `t` remains unchanged, as it is not affected by the code. The variable `itest` is still 0.

The stdin now contains `t-1` lines, as one line has been read and processed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers between 1 and 50, inclusive, with 1 <= m, k <= n, `itest` is 0, and stdin contains `t-1` lines.**
