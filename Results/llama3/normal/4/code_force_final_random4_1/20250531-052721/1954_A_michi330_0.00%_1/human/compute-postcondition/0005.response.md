Output: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers between 1 and 50, inclusive, with 1 <= m, k <= n, `itest` is 0, and stdin contains `t-1` lines. The current value of `n` is less than or equal to `k`, or the difference between `n` and the ceiling of `n` divided by `m` is less than `k`, and 'NO' is being printed**
