To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `itest` and `t`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, we can conclude that `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute. Additionally, `itest` should be initialized to 0, as it is the starting value of the range.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains `t` lines, each containing three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` (1 <= m, k <= n <= 50), `itest` is 0**
