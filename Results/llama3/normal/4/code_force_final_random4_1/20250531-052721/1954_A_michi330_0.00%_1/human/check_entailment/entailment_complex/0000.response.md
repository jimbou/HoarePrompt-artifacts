Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible for Alice to paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.

The program first checks if the number of parts `n` is less than or equal to the number of parts Bob can repaint `k`. If this is the case, then Bob can always repaint all parts to have the same color, so the program prints 'NO'.

If `n` is greater than `k`, the program then checks if the number of parts that Alice can paint with different colors (`n - math.ceil(n / m)`) is less than the number of parts Bob can repaint `k`. If this is the case, then Bob can always repaint the remaining parts to have the same color, so the program prints 'NO'.

If neither of these conditions is met, then it is possible for Alice to paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color, so the program prints 'Yes'.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct result for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
