The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) first, and that integer is assigned into `t`. So stdin now contains `t` lines, each containing three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` (1 <= m, k <= n <= 50). Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains `t` lines, each containing three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` (1 <= m, k <= n <= 50).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains `t` lines, each containing three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` (1 <= m, k <= n <= 50)**
