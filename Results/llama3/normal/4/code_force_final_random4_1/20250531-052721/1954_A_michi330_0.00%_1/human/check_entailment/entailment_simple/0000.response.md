Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

* The program correctly reads the input values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` from the standard input.
* The program iterates over each test case using a `for` loop.
* For each test case, the program checks two conditions:
	1. If `n` is less than or equal to `k`, it means that Bob can repaint all parts of the ribbon, so Alice cannot paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. In this case, the program prints 'NO'.
	2. If `n` minus the ceiling of `n` divided by `m` is less than `k`, it means that Bob can repaint at most `k` parts to make all parts have the same color. In this case, the program prints 'NO'.
	3. If neither of the above conditions is true, it means that Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. In this case, the program prints 'Yes'.

The program's logic is correct because it takes into account the fact that Bob can repaint at most `k` parts, and that Alice wants to paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. The program's use of the ceiling function to calculate the minimum number of parts that Bob needs to repaint to make all parts have the same color is also correct.

Correctness: **True**
