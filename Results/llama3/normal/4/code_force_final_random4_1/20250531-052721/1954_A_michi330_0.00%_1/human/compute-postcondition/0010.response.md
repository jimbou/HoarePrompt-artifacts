The only variable in the loop head is `itest` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `itest` and `t`. If `itest` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `itest` is 0, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000. For the loop to execute again `itest` must be increased by 1 so `itest` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers between 1 and 50, inclusive, with 1 <= m, k <= n, `itest` is 1, and stdin contains `t-2` lines.**
