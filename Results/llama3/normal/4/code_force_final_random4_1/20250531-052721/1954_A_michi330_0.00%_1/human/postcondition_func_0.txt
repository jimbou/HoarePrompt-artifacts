This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers n, m, and k. It then determines whether it is possible to satisfy a certain condition based on these integers. If the condition is not met, it prints 'NO', otherwise it prints 'Yes'. The function processes all test cases and prints the corresponding results.
