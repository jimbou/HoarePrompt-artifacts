To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `itest` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `itest` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `itest` is 1 and `t` is an integer between 2 and 1000. For the loop to execute again, `itest` must be increased by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `itest` is 2, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers between 1 and 50, inclusive, with 1 <= m, k <= n, and stdin contains `t-4` lines. If `n` is less than or equal to `k` or `n` minus the ceiling of `n` divided by `m` is less than `k`, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'Yes' is printed.**
