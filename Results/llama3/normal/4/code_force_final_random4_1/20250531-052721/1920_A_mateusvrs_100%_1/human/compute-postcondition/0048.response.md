To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Since `n` is already between 2 and 100, it meets this condition. However, we need to adjust the state of `_` to ensure it's initialized before the loop starts.


State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 2 and 100, stdin contains multiple test cases minus n minus 1, _ is 0, bx is -1, ax is 1000000007, cx is an empty set, r is a list containing a single element 0, a is not 1 or not 2, x is an integer, tmp is 0**
