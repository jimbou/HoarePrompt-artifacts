According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cx`. If `cx` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1, a set containing the integer `x` if `a` is not 2, or a set containing the integer `x` if `a` is not 2. So for the loop to be executed, `cx` must not be empty. This means `a` must be either not 1 or not 2, and `x` must be an integer. Also, `i` is now an element in `cx`.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `tmp` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus n, _ is n-1, `a` is not 1 or not 2, `x` is an integer, `cx` is a set containing the integer x, `i` is an element in `cx`, `ax` is either the minimum of x and 1000000007 or 1000000007, `bx` is either the maximum of x and -1 or -1**
