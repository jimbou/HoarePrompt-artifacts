Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `r` is a list containing two elements, `tmp` is an integer, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 and is at least 2, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `bx` is the maximum of its previous value and `x`. If `a` is 1, then `bx` is the maximum of its previous value and `x`. If `a` is 2, then `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is not 1 or 2, then `ax` is 1000000007 and `cx` is a set containing one element which is `x`. stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `bx` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `x`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `bx` is now the maximum of its previous value and `x`, regardless of the value of `a`. The rest of the variables retain their original values and properties.
