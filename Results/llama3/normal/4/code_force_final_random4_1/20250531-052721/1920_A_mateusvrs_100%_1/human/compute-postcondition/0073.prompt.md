Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 2 and 100, stdin contains multiple test cases minus n minus 1, _ is n, bx is -1, ax is 1000000007, cx is an empty set, r is a list containing a single element 0, a is not 1 or not 2, x is an integer, tmp is 0.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    a, x = map(int, input().split())
    if a == 1:
        bx = max(x, bx)
    elif a == 2:
        ax = min(x, ax)
    else:
        cx.add(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 2 and 100, stdin contains multiple test cases minus n minus 2, _ is 0, if a is 1, then bx is the maximum of x and -1, otherwise bx is -1, ax is 1000000007 if a is not 2, otherwise ax is the minimum of x and 1000000007, cx is an empty set if a is not 2, otherwise cx is a set containing the integer x, r is a list containing a single element 0, a is an integer, x is an integer, tmp is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `tmp` is 0, `_` is 1, `r` is a list containing a single element 0. If `a` is 1, then `bx` is the maximum of `x` and `x`. If `a` is not 1, then `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1. `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is not 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. If `a` is 2, then `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`. If `a` is not 2 and `cx` was not empty before, then `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`. If `a` is not 2 and `cx` was empty before, then `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`. Stdin contains multiple test cases minus n minus 3.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `tmp` is 0, `_` is 2, `r` is a list containing a single element 0. If the input integer `a` is 1, then `bx` is the maximum of the input integer `x` and `x`. If the input integer `a` is not 1, then `bx` is the maximum of the input integer `x` and -1. `ax` is 1000000007 if the input integer `a` is not 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of the input integer `x` and 1000000007. If the input integer `a` is 2, then `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`. If the input integer `a` is not 2 and `cx` was not empty before, then `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`. If the input integer `a` is not 2 and `cx` was empty before, then `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`. `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus n minus 4 if `a` is 1, otherwise stdin contains multiple test cases minus n minus 5, and `bx` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `x` if `a` is 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
