Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, stdin contains multiple test cases minus n minus 2, `_` is 0, `bx` is -1, `ax` is 1000000007, `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`, `r` is a list containing a single element 0, `a` is an integer not equal to 1 and not equal to 2, `x` is an integer, `tmp` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `cx` has been updated to include the integer `x`, while all other variables remain unchanged. The set `cx` now contains a single element, which is the value of `x`. All other conditions and values of the variables are still valid as specified in the initial state.
