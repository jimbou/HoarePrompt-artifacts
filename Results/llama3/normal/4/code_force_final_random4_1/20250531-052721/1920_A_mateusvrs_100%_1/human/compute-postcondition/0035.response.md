Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `tmp` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus n, _ is n-1, `a` is not 1 or not 2, `x` is an integer, `cx` is a set containing the integer x, `i` is an element in `cx`, `ax` is either the minimum of x and 1000000007 or 1000000007, `bx` is either the maximum of x and -1 or -1. The current value of `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`.**

In this output state, the value of `tmp` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `tmp` being 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus n, and the relationships between the variables `i`, `ax`, and `bx` are still valid.
