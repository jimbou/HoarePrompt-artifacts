Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer, r is a list containing three elements, tmp is an integer, a is an integer, x is an integer, bx is either -1 or the maximum of its previous value and x, ax is either the minimum of x and 1000000007 or 1000000007, cx is either an empty set, a set containing one element which is x, or a set containing multiple elements which are x and other elements, stdin contains no input. The current value of bx is higher than the current value of ax.**

In this output state, the list `r` now contains three elements, with the new element being `0`. All other variables remain unchanged, and the relationship between `bx` and `ax` is still maintained.
