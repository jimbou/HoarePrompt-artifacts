Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, r is an empty list, n is an integer between 2 and 100, stdin contains multiple test cases minus n, _ is n-1. If a is 1, then cx is an empty set, ax is 1000000007, and bx is the maximum of x and 1. If a is 2, then ax is the minimum of x and 1000000007, and bx is -1. If a is neither 1 nor 2, then cx is a set containing the integer x, and bx is the maximum of x and -1. Otherwise, if a is not 2, cx is a set containing the integer x, ax is 1000000007, and bx is the maximum of x and -1. If a is 2, then ax is the minimum of x and 1000000007, and bx is -1.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed n times, and the values of t, r, and n remain unchanged. The value of _ has been incremented to n-1, indicating the number of iterations. The values of ax, bx, and cx depend on the values of a and x in the last iteration of the loop. If a is 1, ax remains at its initial value, bx is updated to the maximum of x and 1, and cx remains empty. If a is 2, ax is updated to the minimum of x and 1000000007, and bx remains at its initial value. If a is neither 1 nor 2, cx contains the integer x, and bx is updated to the maximum of x and -1. If a is not 2, cx contains the integer x, ax remains at its initial value, and bx is updated to the maximum of x and -1. If a is 2, ax is updated to the minimum of x and 1000000007, and bx remains at its initial value.
