Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `_` is 0. If `a` is equal to 2, then `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. Otherwise, `cx` is a set containing the integer `x` and `a` is an integer not equal to 1 and not equal to 2. In both cases, `bx` is -1.***
