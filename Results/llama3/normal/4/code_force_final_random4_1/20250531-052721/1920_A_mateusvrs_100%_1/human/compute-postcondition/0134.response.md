Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `r` is a list containing three elements, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `bx` is either -1 or the maximum of its previous value and `x`, `ax` is either the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 or 1000000007, `cx` is a set containing multiple elements which are `x` and other elements, `tmp` is the total number of elements in `cx` that are within the range of `bx` and `ax` (inclusive).**

The value of `r` has been updated by appending a new element, which is the result of the expression `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`. This new element is the difference between the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 (or 1000000007 itself) and the maximum of the previous value of `bx` and `x` (or -1), plus 1, minus the total number of elements in `cx` that are within the range of `bx` and `ax` (inclusive). The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
