Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `tmp` is 0, `_` is 2, `r` is a list containing a single element 0. If the input integer `a` is 1, then `bx` is the maximum of the input integer `x` and `x`. If the input integer `a` is not 1, then `bx` is the maximum of the input integer `x` and -1. `ax` is 1000000007 if the input integer `a` is not 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of the input integer `x` and 1000000007. If the input integer `a` is 2, then `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`. If the input integer `a` is not 2 and `cx` was not empty before, then `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`. If the input integer `a` is not 2 and `cx` was empty before, then `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`. `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus n minus 4.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `tmp`, `_`, and `r` remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `x` are updated to the input integers. The values of `bx`, `ax`, and `cx` are updated based on the input integers `a` and `x`. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus n minus 4.
