The only object in the loop head is variable `i` and set `cx`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the set `cx`. If the set `cx` has at least two elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `cx` has at least one more element, `i` is another element in `cx`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the set `cx` must have at least two elements and `i` is another element in `cx`.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, stdin contains multiple test cases minus n, _ is n, `r` is a list containing a single element 0, `tmp` is 2 if `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, otherwise `tmp` is 1, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer. If `a` is 1, then `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values. If `a` is not 1, then `bx` is -1. `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is not 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values. If `a` is 2, then `cx` is a set containing all `x` values. If `a` is not 2, then `cx` is a set containing all `x` values if `cx` was not empty before, otherwise `cx` is a set containing all `x` values. Additionally, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, `cx` is not empty and has at least two elements, `i` is another element in `cx`.**
