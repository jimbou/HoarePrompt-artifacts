Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, stdin contains multiple test cases minus n, _ is n, `r` is a list containing a single element 0, `tmp` is 3 if `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, otherwise `tmp` is 2, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer. If `a` is 1, then `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values. If `a` is not 1, then `bx` is -1. `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is not 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values. If `a` is 2, then `cx` is a set containing all `x` values. If `a` is not 2, then `cx` is a set containing all `x` values if `cx` was not empty before, otherwise `cx` is a set containing all `x` values. Additionally, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, `cx` is not empty and has at least two elements, `i` is another element in `cx`.**

In this output state, the value of `tmp` has been incremented by 1. If `i` is within the range of `bx` and `ax`, `tmp` is now 3; otherwise, it is 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
