Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, `_` is 2. If `a` is 1, then `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, and `bx` is the maximum of `x` and 1. If `a` is 2, then `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, and `bx` is -1. If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, then `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`, and `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1. Otherwise, if `a` is not 2, `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`, `ax` is 1000000007, and `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1. If `a` is 2, then `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, and `bx` is -1.***
