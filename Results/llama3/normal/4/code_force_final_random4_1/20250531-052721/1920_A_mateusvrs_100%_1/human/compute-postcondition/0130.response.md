To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in cx:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `i` and `cx`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `cx` has at least one more element. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the second element in the set `cx`, and `cx` has at least 2 elements.

For the loop to execute again, `cx` must have at least 3 elements, and `i` must be the third element in the set `cx`.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `r` is a list containing two elements, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `bx` is either -1 or the maximum of its previous value and `x`, `ax` is either the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 or 1000000007, `cx` is a set containing at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in the set `cx`.**
