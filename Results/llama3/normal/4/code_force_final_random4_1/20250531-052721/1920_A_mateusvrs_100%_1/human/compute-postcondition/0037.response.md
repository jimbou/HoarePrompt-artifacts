To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for i in cx:`, which means the loop iterates over the elements in the set `cx`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is an element in `cx`, and `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`.

For the loop to execute again, `cx` must have at least one more element. Since `cx` is a set, we can't simply increment `i` like we did in the previous examples. Instead, we need to consider the properties of sets.

A set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements. To add a new element to the set, we need to ensure that the new element is not already present in the set.

Let's analyze the state of `cx` at the end of the previous iteration:

* `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`.
* `i` is an element in `cx`, which means `i` is equal to `x`.

To add a new element to `cx`, we need to introduce a new integer that is not equal to `x`. Let's call this new integer `y`.

The updated state of `cx` would be:

* `cx` is a set containing the integers `x` and `y`.

Since `i` is an element in `cx`, we can update its value to `y` for the next iteration.

The other variables in the state, such as `t`, `r`, `n`, `tmp`, `stdin`, `_`, `a`, `x`, `ax`, and `bx`, are not affected by the loop head and can remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `tmp` is 1 if `i` is within the range of `bx` and `ax`, otherwise `tmp` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus n, _ is n-1, `a` is not 1 or not 2, `x` is an integer, `cx` is a set containing the integers x and y, `i` is y, `ax` is either the minimum of x and 1000000007 or 1000000007, `bx` is either the maximum of x and -1 or -1**
