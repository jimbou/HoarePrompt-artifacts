The only variable in the loop head is variable _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _ and n. If _ is less than n, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 100. For the loop to execute again _ is increased by 1 so _ is 1 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 1.
State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 2 and 100, stdin contains multiple test cases minus n minus 2, _ is 1, if a is 1, then bx is the maximum of x and -1, otherwise bx is -1, ax is 1000000007 if a is not 2, otherwise ax is the minimum of x and 1000000007, cx is an empty set if a is not 2, otherwise cx is a set containing the integer x, r is a list containing a single element 0, a is an integer, x is an integer, tmp is 0**
