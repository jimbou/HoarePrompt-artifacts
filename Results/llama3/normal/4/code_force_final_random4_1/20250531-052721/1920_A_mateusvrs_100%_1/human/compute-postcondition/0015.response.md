Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, `_` is 1. If `a` is 1, then `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, and `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1. If `a` is 2, then `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, and `bx` is -1. If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, then `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`, and `bx` is -1.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `r`, `n`, and `_` remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `x` are updated to the integers read from the input. The value of `cx`, `ax`, and `bx` are updated based on the value of `a`. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus three.
