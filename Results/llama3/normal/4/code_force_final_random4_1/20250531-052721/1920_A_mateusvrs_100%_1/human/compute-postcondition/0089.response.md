Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, stdin contains multiple test cases minus n, _ is n, `r` is a list containing two elements: the first element is 0 and the second element is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, `tmp` is the number of elements in `cx` that are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer. If `a` is 1, then `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values. If `a` is not 1, then `bx` is -1. `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is not 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values. If `a` is 2, then `cx` is a set containing all `x` values. If `a` is not 2, then `cx` is a set containing all `x` values if `cx` was not empty before, otherwise `cx` is a set containing all `x` values. Additionally, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, `cx` is not empty and has at least as many elements as the number of iterations of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `r` now contains a second element, which is the result of the expression `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`. This expression calculates the difference between the upper bound `ax` and the lower bound `bx`, adds 1, and then subtracts the number of elements in `cx` that fall within this range. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
