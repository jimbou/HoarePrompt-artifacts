To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 0, `r` is a list containing two elements, `tmp` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 and is at least 1, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one**
