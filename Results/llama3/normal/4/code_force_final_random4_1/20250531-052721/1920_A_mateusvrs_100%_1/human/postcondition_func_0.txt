This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains an integer n followed by n lines of two integers a and x. It then processes each test case by finding the maximum value of x when a is 1, the minimum value of x when a is 2, and storing all x values when a is 3. If the maximum value of x when a is 1 is greater than the minimum value of x when a is 2, it appends 0 to the result list. Otherwise, it counts the number of x values within the range of the maximum and minimum x values (inclusive) and subtracts this count from the difference between the maximum and minimum x values plus 1, appending the result to the list. Finally, it prints the elements of the result list, each on a new line.
