Output State: **t is 0, r is a list containing t elements, stdin contains no input, n is an integer, a is an integer, x is an integer, bx is either -1 or the maximum of its previous value and x, ax is either the minimum of x and 1000000007 or 1000000007, cx is either an empty set, a set containing one element which is x, or a set containing multiple elements which are x and other elements, tmp is the total number of elements in cx that are within the range of bx and ax (inclusive).**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the variable t will be 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The list r will contain t elements, where each element represents the result of a test case. The variable n will be an integer, a will be an integer, x will be an integer, bx will be either -1 or the maximum of its previous value and x, ax will be either the minimum of x and 1000000007 or 1000000007, cx will be either an empty set, a set containing one element which is x, or a set containing multiple elements which are x and other elements, and tmp will be the total number of elements in cx that are within the range of bx and ax (inclusive). The stdin will contain no input, indicating that all test cases have been processed.
