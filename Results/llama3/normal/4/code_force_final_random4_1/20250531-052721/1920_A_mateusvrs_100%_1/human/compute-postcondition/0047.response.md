Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 2 and 100, stdin contains multiple test cases minus n minus 1, _ is n, bx is -1, ax is 1000000007, cx is an empty set, r is a list containing a single element 0, a is not 1 or not 2, x is an integer, tmp is 0.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `t` remains unchanged as an integer greater than 0. The value of `n` is updated to an integer between 2 and 100, which is obtained from the input. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus `n` minus 1, as one input has been consumed. The variable `_` is assigned the value of `n`. The variables `bx` and `ax` are updated to -1 and 1000000007, respectively. The set `cx` is initialized as an empty set. The list `r` contains a single element 0. The value of `a` remains unchanged as not 1 or not 2. The value of `x` remains unchanged as an integer. The variable `tmp` is updated to 0, as the set `cx` is empty and does not contain any elements within the range of `bx` and `ax`.
