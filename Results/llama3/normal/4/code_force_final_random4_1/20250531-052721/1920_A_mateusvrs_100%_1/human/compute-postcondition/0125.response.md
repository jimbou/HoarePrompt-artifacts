Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `r` is a list containing two elements, `tmp` is 1, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `bx` is either -1 or the maximum of its previous value and `x`, `ax` is either the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 or 1000000007, `cx` is a set containing at least 1 element, and the first element `i` in `cx` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`.**

In this output state, the value of `tmp` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `tmp` being equal to 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
