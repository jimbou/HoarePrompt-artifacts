To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the current state.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `_` is within the range of `t`. Since `_` is currently `n-1`, for the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1.

Here's the updated state:

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, stdin contains multiple test cases minus n, _ is n, `bx` is greater than `ax`, then `r` is a list containing a single element 0. Otherwise, `r` is a list containing one integer, `a` is not 1 or not 2, `x` is an integer, `cx` is a set containing at least 2 integers, `ax` is either the minimum of x and 1000000007 or 1000000007, `bx` is either the maximum of x and -1 or -1. `tmp` is equal to the number of elements in `cx` that are within the range of `bx` and `ax`.**

Note that only the state of `_` has been updated, as it is the only variable in the loop head. The other variables remain unchanged.
