The only object in the loop head is variable  i and set cx, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the set cx.  If the set cx has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, cx has at least 1 element, i is the first element in the set cx. So for the loop to be executed one more time the set cx must have at least 2 elements and the i is the second element in the set cx.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `r` is a list containing two elements, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `bx` is either -1 or the maximum of its previous value and `x`, `ax` is either the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 or 1000000007, `cx` is a set containing at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in the set `cx`.**
