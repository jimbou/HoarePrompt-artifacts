The code `ax = min(x, ax)` updates the value of `ax` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `x`. 

Since `ax` is initially 1000000007 and `x` is an integer, the new value of `ax` will be either `x` or 1000000007, whichever is smaller.

The other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `ax` is either `x` or 1000000007 (whichever is smaller), `_` is 0, `bx` is -1, `cx` is an empty set, `r` is a list containing a single element 0, `a` is 2, `x` is an integer, `tmp` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus n minus 2.**
