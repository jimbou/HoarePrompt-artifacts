Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic to find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. 

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The program initializes `ax` to a large value (1000000000.0 + 7) and `bx` to -1. This is done to ensure that `ax` will be updated to the smallest value of type 2 constraints and `bx` will be updated to the largest value of type 1 constraints.

2. The program then iterates over each constraint. If the constraint is of type 1, it updates `bx` to be the maximum of `bx` and the current constraint value. If the constraint is of type 2, it updates `ax` to be the minimum of `ax` and the current constraint value. If the constraint is of type 3, it adds the constraint value to the set `cx`.

3. After iterating over all constraints, the program checks if `bx` is greater than `ax`. If this is the case, it means that there are no integers k that satisfy all constraints (because `bx` is the largest lower bound and `ax` is the smallest upper bound), so it appends 0 to the result list.

4. If `bx` is not greater than `ax`, the program calculates the number of integers k that satisfy all constraints. It does this by subtracting `bx` from `ax` and adding 1 (to include both `bx` and `ax` in the count), and then subtracting the number of integers in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive). This is because these integers are excluded by the type 3 constraints.

5. Finally, the program prints the result list, which contains the number of integers k that satisfy all constraints for each test case.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the case where there are no integers k that satisfy all constraints (when `bx` is greater than `ax`). It also correctly handles the case where there are integers k that satisfy all constraints, and it correctly excludes the integers that are excluded by the type 3 constraints.
