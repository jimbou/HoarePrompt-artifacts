Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 2 and 100, stdin contains multiple test cases minus n, _ is n, r is a list containing a single element 0, tmp is 0, a is an integer, x is an integer. If a is 1, then bx is the maximum of all x values. If a is not 1, then bx is -1. ax is 1000000007 if a is not 2, otherwise ax is the minimum of all x values. If a is 2, then cx is a set containing all x values. If a is not 2, then cx is a set containing all x values if cx was not empty before, otherwise cx is a set containing all x values.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows:

* The value of `t` remains unchanged as an integer greater than 0.
* The value of `n` remains unchanged as an integer between 2 and 100.
* The value of `_` is now equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has executed `n` times.
* The value of `r` remains unchanged as a list containing a single element 0.
* The value of `tmp` remains unchanged as 0.
* The value of `a` is now an integer, but its value is not specified.
* The value of `x` is now an integer, but its value is not specified.
* The value of `bx` is now the maximum of all `x` values if `a` is 1, otherwise it is -1.
* The value of `ax` is now 1000000007 if `a` is not 2, otherwise it is the minimum of all `x` values.
* The value of `cx` is now a set containing all `x` values if `a` is 2, otherwise it is a set containing all `x` values if `cx` was not empty before, otherwise it is a set containing all `x` values.

Note that the values of `bx`, `ax`, and `cx` depend on the values of `a` and `x` during the execution of the loop.
