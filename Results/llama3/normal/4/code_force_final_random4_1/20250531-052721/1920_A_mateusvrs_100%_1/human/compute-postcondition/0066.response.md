The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `n` is between 2 and 100. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `tmp` is 0, `_` is 2, `r` is a list containing a single element 0. If `a` is 1, then `bx` is the maximum of `x` and `x`. If `a` is not 1, then `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1. `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is not 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. If `a` is 2, then `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`. If `a` is not 2 and `cx` was not empty before, then `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`. If `a` is not 2 and `cx` was empty before, then `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`. Stdin contains multiple test cases minus n minus 3**
