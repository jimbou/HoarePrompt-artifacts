Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `r` is a list containing two elements, `tmp` is 0, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `bx` is either -1 or the maximum of its previous value and `x`, `ax` is either the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 or 1000000007, `cx` is either an empty set, a set containing one element which is `x`, or a set containing multiple elements which are `x` and other elements, stdin contains no input, and `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `tmp` has been reset to 0, while all other variables remain unchanged. The conditions on the variables `t`, `n`, `r`, `a`, `x`, `bx`, `ax`, and `cx` are still valid, and the relationship between `bx` and `ax` is maintained.
