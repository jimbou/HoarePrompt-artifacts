Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `tmp` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus n, _ is n-1, `a` is not 1 or not 2, `x` is an integer, `cx` is a set containing the integer x, `i` is an element in `cx`, `ax` is either the minimum of x and 1000000007 or 1000000007, `bx` is either the maximum of x and -1 or -1. The current value of `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`***
