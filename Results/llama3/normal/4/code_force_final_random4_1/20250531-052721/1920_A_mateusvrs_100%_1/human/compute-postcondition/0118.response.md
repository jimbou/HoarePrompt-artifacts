Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, _ is n, r is a list containing two elements, tmp is an integer, a is an integer, x is an integer, bx is either -1 or the maximum of its previous value and x, ax is either the minimum of x and 1000000007 or 1000000007, cx is either an empty set, a set containing one element which is x, or a set containing multiple elements which are x and other elements, stdin contains no input.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `_` will be equal to `n`, which is the number of iterations. The values of `t`, `r`, and `tmp` remain unchanged. The value of `bx` will be either -1 or the maximum of its previous value and `x`, depending on the values of `a` and `x` in each iteration. The value of `ax` will be either the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 or 1000000007, depending on the values of `a` and `x` in each iteration. The value of `cx` will be either an empty set, a set containing one element which is `x`, or a set containing multiple elements which are `x` and other elements, depending on the values of `a` and `x` in each iteration. Finally, the stdin will contain no input, indicating that all input has been processed.
