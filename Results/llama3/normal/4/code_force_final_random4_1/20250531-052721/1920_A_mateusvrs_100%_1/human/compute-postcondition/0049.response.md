Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 2 and 100, stdin contains multiple test cases minus n minus 2, _ is 0, bx is -1, ax is 1000000007, cx is an empty set, r is a list containing a single element 0, a is an integer, x is an integer, tmp is 0**

In this output state, the values of t, n, _, bx, ax, cx, r, and tmp remain unchanged. The value of a is now an integer, and the value of x is also an integer. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus n minus 2, since two inputs were read from the stdin.
