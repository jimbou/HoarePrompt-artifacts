Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `tmp` is 0, `_` is 1, `r` is a list containing a single element 0, if `a` is 1, then `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, otherwise `bx` is -1, `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is not 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `cx` is a set containing the integer `x` if `a` is 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing the integer `x` if it was not empty before, otherwise it is a set containing the integer `x`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus n minus 3.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t`, `n`, `a`, `x`, `tmp`, `_`, `r`, `bx`, and `ax` remains the same as in the initial state. The value of `cx` is updated to include the integer `x`. If `a` is 2, `cx` now contains the integer `x`. If `a` is not 2 and `cx` was not empty before, `cx` now contains the integer `x`. If `a` is not 2 and `cx` was empty before, `cx` now contains the integer `x`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus n minus 3.
