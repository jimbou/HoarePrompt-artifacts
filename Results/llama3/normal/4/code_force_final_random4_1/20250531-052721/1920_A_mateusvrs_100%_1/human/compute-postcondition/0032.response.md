Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `tmp` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus n, _ is n-1. If a is 1, then cx is an empty set, ax is 1000000007, and bx is the maximum of x and 1. If a is 2, then ax is the minimum of x and 1000000007, and bx is -1. If a is neither 1 nor 2, then cx is a set containing the integer x, and bx is the maximum of x and -1. Otherwise, if a is not 2, cx is a set containing the integer x, ax is 1000000007, and bx is the maximum of x and -1. If a is 2, then ax is the minimum of x and 1000000007, and bx is -1. Additionally, bx is less than or equal to ax.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `tmp` which is initialized to 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
