Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `r` is a list containing a single element 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, stdin contains multiple test cases minus n, _ is n-1. If a is 1, then cx is an empty set, ax is 1000000007, and bx is the maximum of x and 1. If a is 2, then ax is the minimum of x and 1000000007, and bx is -1. If a is neither 1 nor 2, then cx is a set containing the integer x, and bx is the maximum of x and -1. Otherwise, if a is not 2, cx is a set containing the integer x, ax is 1000000007, and bx is the maximum of x and -1. If a is 2, then ax is the minimum of x and 1000000007, and bx is -1. The current value of bx is greater than ax**

In this output state, the value of `r` has been updated to a list containing a single element 0, while the values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The conditions related to the values of `a`, `ax`, `bx`, and `cx` are still valid, and the current value of `bx` is still greater than `ax`.
