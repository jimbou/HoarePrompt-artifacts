Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `tmp` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus n, _ is n-1. If a is 1, then cx is an empty set, ax is 1000000007, and bx is the maximum of x and 1. If a is 2, then ax is the minimum of x and 1000000007, and bx is -1. If a is neither 1 nor 2, then cx is a set containing the integer x, and bx is the maximum of x and -1. Otherwise, if a is not 2, cx is a set containing the integer x, ax is 1000000007, and bx is the maximum of x and -1. If a is 2, then ax is the minimum of x and 1000000007, and bx is -1. Additionally, bx is less than or equal to ax.
Code of the loop:
for i in cx:
    if i >= bx and i <= ax:
        tmp += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `tmp` is 1 if `i` is within the range of `bx` and `ax`, otherwise `tmp` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus n, _ is n-1, `a` is not 1 or not 2, `x` is an integer, `cx` is a set containing the integer x, `i` is an element in `cx`, `ax` is either the minimum of x and 1000000007 or 1000000007, `bx` is either the maximum of x and -1 or -1

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `a` is not 1 or not 2, `x` is an integer, `cx` is a set containing the integers x and y, `ax` is either the minimum of x and 1000000007 or 1000000007, `bx` is either the maximum of x and -1 or -1. If `i` is within the range of `bx` and `ax`, `tmp` is 2, otherwise `tmp` is 1. stdin contains multiple test cases minus n, _ is n-1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `a` is not 1 or not 2, `x` is an integer, `cx` is a set containing at least 2 integers, `ax` is either the minimum of x and 1000000007 or 1000000007, `bx` is either the maximum of x and -1 or -1. If `i` is within the range of `bx` and `ax`, `tmp` is 3, otherwise `tmp` is 2. stdin contains multiple test cases minus n, _ is n-1, `i` is the second element in the set `cx`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
