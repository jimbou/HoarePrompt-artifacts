Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `tmp` is 0, `_` is 1, `r` is a list containing a single element 0, if `a` is 1, then `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, otherwise `bx` is -1, `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is not 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is not 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus n minus 3.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `n`, `tmp`, and `_` remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `x` are updated to the two integers read from the input. The values of `bx`, `ax`, and `cx` are updated based on the new value of `a`. The list `r` remains unchanged. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus n minus 3.
