Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 0, `r` is a list containing two elements, `tmp` is an integer, `a` is an integer and equals to the first integer from the input, `x` is an integer and equals to the second integer from the input, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 and is at least 1, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_`, `r`, `tmp`, `n`, `cx`, and `bx` remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `x` are updated to the first and second integers from the input, respectively. The value of `ax` is updated to the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus two.
