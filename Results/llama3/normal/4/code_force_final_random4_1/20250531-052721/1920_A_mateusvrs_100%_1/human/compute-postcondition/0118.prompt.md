Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 1, _ is 1, r is a list containing two elements, tmp is an integer, a is an integer, x is an integer, n is an integer between 2 and 100, cx is an empty set, ax is 1000000007, bx is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    a, x = map(int, input().split())
    if a == 1:
        bx = max(x, bx)
    elif a == 2:
        ax = min(x, ax)
    else:
        cx.add(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 0, `r` is a list containing two elements, `tmp` is an integer, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 and is at least 1, `bx` is either -1 or the maximum of its previous value and `x`. If `a` is 1, then `bx` is the maximum of its previous value and `x`. If `a` is 2, then `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is not 1 or 2, then `ax` is 1000000007 and `cx` is a set containing one element which is `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `r` is a list containing two elements, `tmp` is an integer, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 and is at least 2, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `bx` is either -1 or the maximum of its previous value and `x`. If `a` is 1, then `bx` is the maximum of its previous value and `x`. If `a` is 2, then `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 and `cx` is an empty set if `a` is not 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing two elements which are `x` and another element. If `a` is not 1 or 2, then `ax` is 1000000007 and `cx` is a set containing one element which is `x`. stdin contains no input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `r` is a list containing two elements, `tmp` is an integer, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 and is at least 3, `a` is an integer, `bx` is either -1 or the maximum of its previous value and `x`, `ax` is either the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 or 1000000007, `x` is an integer, stdin contains no input. If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and its previous value, and `cx` is either an empty set, a set containing two elements which are `x` and another element, or a set containing one element which is `x`. If `a` is 2, `cx` is either an empty set, a set containing two elements which are `x` and another element, or a set containing one element which is `x`. If `a` is not 1 or 2, `cx` is a set containing one element which is `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
