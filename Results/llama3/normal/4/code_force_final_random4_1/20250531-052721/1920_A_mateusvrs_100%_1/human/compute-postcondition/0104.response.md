The only variables in the loop head are variables `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `n` is between 2 and 100 and is at least 1. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `r` is a list containing two elements, `tmp` is an integer, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 and is at least 2, `bx` is either -1 or the maximum of its previous value and `x`. If `a` is 1, then `bx` is the maximum of its previous value and `x`. If `a` is 2, then `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is not 1 or 2, then `ax` is 1000000007 and `cx` is a set containing one element which is `x`.**
