The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer, `r` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each test case contains an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 100) followed by `n` lines, each containing two integers `a` and `x` (`a` in {1,2,3}, 1 <= `x` <= 10^9). So for the loop to be executed  `t` must be greater than 0 and `_` is now 0.
State: **`t` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each test case contains an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 100) followed by `n` lines, each containing two integers `a` and `x` (`a` in {1,2,3}, 1 <= `x` <= 10^9), `_` is 0**
