Postcondition: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 2 and 100, stdin contains multiple test cases minus n, _ is n, r is a list containing two elements, tmp is an integer, a is an integer, x is an integer. If a is 1, then bx is the maximum of all x values. If a is not 1, then bx is -1. ax is 1000000007 if a is not 2, otherwise ax is the minimum of all x values. If a is 2, then cx is a set containing all x values. If a is not 2, then cx is a set containing all x values if cx was not empty before, otherwise cx is a set containing all x values. If bx is greater than ax, then r contains two elements 0. If bx is less than or equal to ax, then the first element of r is 0 and the second element is ax - bx + 1 - tmp, tmp is the number of elements in cx that are greater than or equal to bx and less than or equal to ax.**
