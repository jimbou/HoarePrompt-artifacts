To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `cx`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cx`. If `cx` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `cx` is not empty, and `i` is one of the elements in `cx`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `cx` must have at least one more element, and `i` must be the next element in `cx`. Since `cx` is a set, we can't assume any particular order of elements, so we can't determine the exact value of `i` in the next iteration. However, we can say that `i` will be another element in `cx`.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, stdin contains multiple test cases minus n, _ is n, `r` is a list containing a single element 0, `tmp` is 1 if `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, otherwise `tmp` is 0, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer. If `a` is 1, then `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values. If `a` is not 1, then `bx` is -1. `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is not 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values. If `a` is 2, then `cx` is a set containing all `x` values. If `a` is not 2, then `cx` is a set containing all `x` values if `cx` was not empty before, otherwise `cx` is a set containing all `x` values. Additionally, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, `cx` is not empty and has at least one more element, `i` is another element in `cx`.**
