Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `tmp` is 0, `_` is 2, `r` is a list containing a single element 0. If the input integer `a` is 1, then `bx` is the maximum of the input integer `x` and `x`. If the input integer `a` is not 1, then `bx` is the maximum of the input integer `x` and -1. If the input integer `a` is 2, then `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`. If the input integer `a` is not 2 and `cx` was not empty before, then `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`. If the input integer `a` is not 2 and `cx` was empty before, then `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`. `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of the input integer `x` and the previous value of `ax`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus n minus 4.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `ax` has been updated to be the minimum of the input integer `x` and its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus n minus 4.
