Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `_` is 0**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `r`, `n`, `cx`, `ax`, `bx`, and `_` remain unchanged. The code assigns the values of `a` and `x` from the input, which are integers. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus two, as one test case has been processed.
