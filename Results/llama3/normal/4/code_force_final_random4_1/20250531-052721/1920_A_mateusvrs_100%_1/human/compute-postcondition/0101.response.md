Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 0, `r` is a list containing two elements, `tmp` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 and is at least 1, `cx` is a set containing one element which is `x`, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `a` and `x` are assigned the values of two integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `a` is not equal to 1, and `a` is not equal to 2**

In this output state, the value of `cx` has been updated to include the value of `x`, which is an integer. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `a` and `n` are still valid. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two, indicating that two integers have been read from the input.
