The only object in the loop head is variable `i` and set `cx`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the set `cx`.  If the set has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `cx` has at least 1 element, `i` is an element in the set `cx`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the set must have at least 2 elements and the `i` is the second element in the set `cx`. 
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `a` is not 1 or not 2, `x` is an integer, `cx` is a set containing at least 2 integers, `ax` is either the minimum of x and 1000000007 or 1000000007, `bx` is either the maximum of x and -1 or -1. If `i` is within the range of `bx` and `ax`, `tmp` is 2, otherwise `tmp` is 1. stdin contains multiple test cases minus n, _ is n-1, `i` is the second element in the set `cx`.**
