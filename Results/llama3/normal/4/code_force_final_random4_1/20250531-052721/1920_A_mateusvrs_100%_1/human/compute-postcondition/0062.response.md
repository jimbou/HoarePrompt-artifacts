Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `tmp` is 0, `_` is 1, `r` is a list containing a single element 0, if `a` is 1, then `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, otherwise `bx` is -1, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 if `a` is not 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is not 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus n minus 3.**

In this output state, the value of `ax` has been updated to be the minimum of `x` and its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ax` is now more specific, as it is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 if `a` is not 2, or the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 if `a` is 2. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus n minus 3.
