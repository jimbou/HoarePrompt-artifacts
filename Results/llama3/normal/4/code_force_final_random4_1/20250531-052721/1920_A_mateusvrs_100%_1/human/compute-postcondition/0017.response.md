Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, `_` is 1. If `a` is 1, then `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, and `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1. If `a` is 2, then `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, and `bx` is -1. If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, then `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`, and `bx` is -1.**

In this output state, the value of `ax` has been updated to be the minimum of `x` and its original value. This change affects the values of `ax` in all three cases: when `a` is 1, when `a` is 2, and when `a` is neither 1 nor 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
