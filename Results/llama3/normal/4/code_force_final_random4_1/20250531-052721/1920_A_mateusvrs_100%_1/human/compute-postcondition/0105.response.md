Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `r` is a list containing two elements, `tmp` is an integer, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 and is at least 2, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `bx` is either -1 or the maximum of its previous value and `x`. If `a` is 1, then `bx` is the maximum of its previous value and `x`. If `a` is 2, then `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is not 1 or 2, then `ax` is 1000000007 and `cx` is a set containing one element which is `x`. stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` is still an integer greater than 1, `_` is still 1, `r` is still a list containing two elements, `tmp` is still an integer, `n` is still an integer between 2 and 100 and is at least 2. The values of `a` and `x` are now integers obtained from the input. The value of `bx` depends on the value of `a`. If `a` is 1, then `bx` is the maximum of its previous value and `x`. If `a` is 2, then `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is not 1 or 2, then `ax` is 1000000007 and `cx` is a set containing one element which is `x`. There is no input left in stdin.
