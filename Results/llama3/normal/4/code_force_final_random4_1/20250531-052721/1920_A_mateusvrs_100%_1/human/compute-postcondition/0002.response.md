The code snippet provided reads an integer `n` from the standard input, initializes an empty set `cx`, and assigns a large integer value to `ax` and a negative value to `bx`. 

Here's the combined effect of all lines on the program:

- The first line reads an integer `n` from the standard input. Since stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, after reading `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. 
- The second line initializes an empty set `cx`. This does not affect any existing variables.
- The third line assigns a large integer value to `ax`. This does not affect any existing variables.
- The fourth line assigns a negative value to `bx`. This does not affect any existing variables.

After executing the entire code block, the state of the variables is as follows:

- `t` remains unchanged as an integer greater than 0.
- `r` remains unchanged as an empty list.
- `n` is now an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), read from the standard input.
- `cx` is an empty set.
- `ax` is a large integer value (1000000000 + 7).
- `bx` is a negative integer value (-1).
- Stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.

Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, r is an empty list, n is an integer between 2 and 100, cx is an empty set, ax is 1000000007, bx is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**
