Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, stdin contains multiple test cases minus n, _ is n, `r` is a list containing two elements 0, `tmp` is 0, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer. If `a` is 1, then the current value of `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values. If `a` is not 1, then the current value of `bx` is -1. `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is not 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values. If `a` is 2, then the current value of `cx` is a set containing all `x` values. If `a` is not 2, then the current value of `cx` is a set containing all `x` values if `cx` was not empty before, otherwise the current value of `cx` is a set containing all `x` values. The current value of `bx` is greater than the current value of `ax`.**

In this output state, the only change is that the list `r` now contains two elements, both of which are 0. All other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
