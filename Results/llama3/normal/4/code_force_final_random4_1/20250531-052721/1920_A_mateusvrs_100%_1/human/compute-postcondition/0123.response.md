To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the set `cx`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the set `cx`. If `cx` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Since `cx` is either an empty set, a set containing one element which is `x`, or a set containing multiple elements which are `x` and other elements, we need to adjust its state to ensure it has at least 1 element.

Additionally, the variable `i` is not initialized before the loop, so we need to adjust its state to be the first element in the set `cx`.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `r` is a list containing two elements, `tmp` is 0, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `bx` is either -1 or the maximum of its previous value and `x`, `ax` is either the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 or 1000000007, `cx` is a set containing at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `cx`, and stdin contains no input**
