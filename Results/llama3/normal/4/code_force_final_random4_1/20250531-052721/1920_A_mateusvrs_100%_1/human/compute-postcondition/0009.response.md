Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `a` is an integer equal to 2, `x` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `_` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `ax` has been updated to be the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two, and the variable `_` is still 0.
