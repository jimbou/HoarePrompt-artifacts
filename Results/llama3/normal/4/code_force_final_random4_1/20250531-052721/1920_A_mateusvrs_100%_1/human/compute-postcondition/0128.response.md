Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `r` is a list containing two elements, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `bx` is either -1 or the maximum of its previous value and `x`, `ax` is either the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 or 1000000007, `cx` is a set containing at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in the set `cx`, `tmp` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `tmp` is incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The values of `t`, `n`, `r`, `a`, `x`, `bx`, `ax`, `cx`, and `i` are the same as before, with `t` still greater than 1, `r` still containing two elements, `cx` still containing at least 2 elements, and `i` still being the second element in the set `cx`.
