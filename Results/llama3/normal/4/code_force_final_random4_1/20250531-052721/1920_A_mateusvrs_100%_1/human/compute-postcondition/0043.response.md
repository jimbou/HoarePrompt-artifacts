Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `a` is not 1 or not 2, `x` is an integer, `cx` is a set containing at least 2 integers, `ax` is either the minimum of x and 1000000007 or 1000000007, `bx` is either the maximum of x and -1 or -1. `tmp` is equal to the number of elements in `cx` that are within the range of `bx` and `ax`. stdin contains multiple test cases minus n, _ is n-1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `tmp` will be equal to the number of elements in the set `cx` that fall within the range defined by `bx` and `ax`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
