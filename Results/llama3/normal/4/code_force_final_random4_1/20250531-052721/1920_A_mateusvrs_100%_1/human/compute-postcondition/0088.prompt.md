Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, stdin contains multiple test cases minus n, _ is n, `r` is a list containing a single element 0, `tmp` is 0, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer. If `a` is 1, then `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values. If `a` is not 1, then `bx` is -1. `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is not 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values. If `a` is 2, then `cx` is a set containing all `x` values. If `a` is not 2, then `cx` is a set containing all `x` values if `cx` was not empty before, otherwise `cx` is a set containing all `x` values. Additionally, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`.
Code of the loop:
for i in cx:
    if i >= bx and i <= ax:
        tmp += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, stdin contains multiple test cases minus n, _ is n, `r` is a list containing a single element 0, `tmp` is 1 if `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, otherwise `tmp` is 0, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer. If `a` is 1, then `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values. If `a` is not 1, then `bx` is -1. `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is not 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values. If `a` is 2, then `cx` is a set containing all `x` values. If `a` is not 2, then `cx` is a set containing all `x` values if `cx` was not empty before, otherwise `cx` is a set containing all `x` values. Additionally, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, `cx` is not empty, `i` is one of the elements in `cx`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, stdin contains multiple test cases minus n, _ is n, `r` is a list containing a single element 0, `tmp` is 2 if `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, otherwise `tmp` is 1, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer. If `a` is 1, then `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values. If `a` is not 1, then `bx` is -1. `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is not 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values. If `a` is 2, then `cx` is a set containing all `x` values. If `a` is not 2, then `cx` is a set containing all `x` values if `cx` was not empty before, otherwise `cx` is a set containing all `x` values. Additionally, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, `cx` is not empty and has at least one more element, `i` is another element in `cx`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, stdin contains multiple test cases minus n, _ is n, `r` is a list containing a single element 0, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer. If `a` is 1, then `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values. If `a` is not 1, then `bx` is -1. `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is not 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values. If `a` is 2, then `cx` is a set containing all `x` values. If `a` is not 2, then `cx` is a set containing all `x` values if `cx` was not empty before, otherwise `cx` is a set containing all `x` values. Additionally, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, `cx` is not empty and has at least two elements, `i` is another element in `cx`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, then `tmp` is 3, otherwise `tmp` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
