Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `tmp` is 0, `_` is 2, `r` is a list containing a single element 0. If the input integer `a` is 1, then `bx` is the maximum of the input integer `x` and `x`. If the input integer `a` is not 1, then `bx` is the maximum of the input integer `x` and -1. `ax` is 1000000007 if the input integer `a` is not 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of the input integer `x` and 1000000007. If the input integer `a` is 2, then `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`. If the input integer `a` is not 2 and `cx` was not empty before, then `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`. If the input integer `a` is not 2 and `cx` was empty before, then `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`. `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus n minus 5.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `cx` has been updated to include the integer `x`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus n minus 5.
