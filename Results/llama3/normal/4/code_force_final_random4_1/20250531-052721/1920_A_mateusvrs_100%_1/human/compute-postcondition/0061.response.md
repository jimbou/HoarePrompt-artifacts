Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `tmp` is 0, `_` is 1, `r` is a list containing a single element 0, if `a` is 1, then `bx` is the maximum of `x` and `x`, otherwise `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is not 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is not 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus n minus 3.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `bx` has been updated to be the maximum of `x` and its previous value. If `a` is 1, then `bx` is now equal to `x`. If `a` is not 1, then `bx` is now equal to the maximum of `x` and -1. The values of the other variables and the stdin remain unchanged.
