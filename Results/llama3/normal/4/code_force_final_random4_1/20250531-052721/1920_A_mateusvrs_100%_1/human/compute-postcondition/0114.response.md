Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `r` is a list containing two elements, `tmp` is an integer, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 and is at least 3, `a` is an integer, `bx` is either -1 or the maximum of its previous value and `x`, `ax` is either the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 or 1000000007, `cx` is either an empty set, a set containing two elements which are `x` and another element, or a set containing one element which is `x`, `x` is an integer, stdin contains no input.**

The value of `ax` is updated to be the minimum of `x` and its previous value. Since `ax` was already either the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 or 1000000007, it will remain the same if `x` is less than or equal to its previous value, or it will be updated to `x` if `x` is less than its previous value. The values of the other variables are not affected.
