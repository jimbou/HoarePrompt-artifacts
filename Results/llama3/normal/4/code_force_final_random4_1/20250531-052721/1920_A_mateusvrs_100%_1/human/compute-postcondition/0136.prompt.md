Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer, r is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each test case contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 100) followed by n lines, each containing two integers a and x (a in {1,2,3}, 1 <= x <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    cx = set()
    ax = int(1000000000.0 + 7)
    bx = -1
    for _ in range(n):
        a, x = map(int, input().split())
        if a == 1:
            bx = max(x, bx)
        elif a == 2:
            ax = min(x, ax)
        else:
            cx.add(x)
    if bx > ax:
        r.append(0)
    else:
        tmp = 0
        for i in cx:
            if i >= bx and i <= ax:
                tmp += 1
        r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, stdin contains multiple test cases minus n, _ is n-1. If `bx` is greater than `ax`, then `r` is a list containing a single element 0. Otherwise, `r` is a list containing one integer, `a` is not 1 or not 2, `x` is an integer, `cx` is a set containing at least 2 integers, `ax` is either the minimum of x and 1000000007 or 1000000007, `bx` is either the maximum of x and -1 or -1. `tmp` is equal to the number of elements in `cx` that are within the range of `bx` and `ax`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 2 and 100, stdin contains multiple test cases minus n, _ is n, r is a list containing two elements, tmp is an integer, a is an integer, x is an integer. If a is 1, then bx is the maximum of all x values. If a is not 1, then bx is -1. ax is 1000000007 if a is not 2, otherwise ax is the minimum of all x values. If a is 2, then cx is a set containing all x values. If a is not 2, then cx is a set containing all x values if cx was not empty before, otherwise cx is a set containing all x values. If bx is greater than ax, then r contains two elements 0. If bx is less than or equal to ax, then the first element of r is 0 and the second element is ax - bx + 1 - tmp, tmp is the number of elements in cx that are greater than or equal to bx and less than or equal to ax.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer, r is a list containing three elements, a is an integer, x is an integer, bx is either -1 or the maximum of its previous value and x, ax is either the minimum of x and 1000000007 or 1000000007, cx is either an empty set, a set containing one element which is x, or a set containing multiple elements which are x and other elements, stdin contains no input. If bx is higher than ax, then the current value of bx is higher than the current value of ax. Otherwise, tmp is the total number of elements in cx that are within the range of bx and ax (inclusive).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
