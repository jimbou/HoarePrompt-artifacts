Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `r` is a list containing two elements, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `bx` is either -1 or the maximum of its previous value and `x`, `ax` is either the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 or 1000000007, `cx` is a set containing at least 1 element. If the first element `i` in `cx` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, then `tmp` is 1. Otherwise, `tmp` is 0.***
