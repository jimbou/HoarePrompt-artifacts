Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, _ is 1, r is a list containing two elements, tmp is an integer, a is an integer, x is an integer, n is an integer between 2 and 100, cx is an empty set, ax is 1000000007, bx is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_`, `r`, `tmp`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged as they were not modified by the code. The value of `n` is updated to an integer between 2 and 100, as it was assigned the value of the input. The variables `cx`, `ax`, and `bx` are newly introduced and assigned the values of an empty set, 1000000007, and -1, respectively. The state of `stdin` is updated to reflect that one test case has been consumed.
