Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, stdin contains multiple test cases minus n, _ is n, `r` is a list containing a single element 0, `tmp` is the number of elements in `cx` that are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer. If `a` is 1, then `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values. If `a` is not 1, then `bx` is -1. `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is not 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values. If `a` is 2, then `cx` is a set containing all `x` values. If `a` is not 2, then `cx` is a set containing all `x` values if `cx` was not empty before, otherwise `cx` is a set containing all `x` values. Additionally, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, `cx` is not empty and has at least as many elements as the number of iterations of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that `tmp` will be the count of elements in `cx` that fall within the range defined by `bx` and `ax`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states, with `cx` being a set containing all `x` values and `bx` and `ax` being determined based on the value of `a`.
