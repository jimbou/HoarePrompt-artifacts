Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `tmp` is 0, `_` is 1, `r` is a list containing a single element 0. If `a` is 1, then `bx` is the maximum of `x` and `x`. If `a` is not 1, then `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1. `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is not 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. If `a` is 2, then `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`. If `a` is not 2 and `cx` was not empty before, then `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`. If `a` is not 2 and `cx` was empty before, then `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`. Stdin contains multiple test cases minus n minus 3.**
