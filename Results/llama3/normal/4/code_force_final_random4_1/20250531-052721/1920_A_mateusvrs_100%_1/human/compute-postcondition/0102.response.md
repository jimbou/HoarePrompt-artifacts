Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 0, `r` is a list containing two elements, `tmp` is an integer, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 and is at least 1, `bx` is -1, `a` and `x` are assigned the values of two integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, and `a` is not equal to 1. If `a` is 2, then `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 and `cx` is an empty set. Otherwise, `ax` is 1000000007 and `cx` is a set containing one element which is `x`.***
