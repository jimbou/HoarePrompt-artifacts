To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(n):`. The only variables involved in the loop head are `_` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `_` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 1, and `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 and is at least 2.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to increment `_` by 1, so `_` becomes 2. The state of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

The states of other variables (`t`, `r`, `tmp`, `a`, `x`, `bx`, `ax`, and `cx`) are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `r` is a list containing two elements, `tmp` is an integer, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 and is at least 3, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `bx` is either -1 or the maximum of its previous value and `x`. If `a` is 1, then `bx` is the maximum of its previous value and `x`. If `a` is 2, then `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 and `cx` is an empty set if `a` is not 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing two elements which are `x` and another element. If `a` is not 1 or 2, then `ax` is 1000000007 and `cx` is a set containing one element which is `x`. stdin contains no input.**
