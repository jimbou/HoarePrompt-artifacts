Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, `_` is 1. If `a` is 1, then `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`, `ax` is 1000000007, and `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1. If `a` is 2, then `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, and `bx` is -1. If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, then `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`, and `bx` is -1.**

The code adds the value of `x` to the set `cx`. If `a` is 1, the set `cx` was initially empty, but now it contains the integer `x`. If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, the set `cx` already contained the integer `x`, so its value does not change. The values of the other variables are not affected.
