Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `j` is either 0 or 1, `_` is 1, `p` is the first element of `l`, `q` is the element of `l` at index `p - 1`, stdin is empty. If `q` is equal to `i + 1`, then `j` is 1 and the number 2 is printed.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition `If q is equal to i + 1, then j is set to 1 and the number 2 is printed` is still valid, but now `i + 1` is 2, so the condition is checking if `q` is equal to 2. If `q` is equal to 2, then `j` is 1 and the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.
