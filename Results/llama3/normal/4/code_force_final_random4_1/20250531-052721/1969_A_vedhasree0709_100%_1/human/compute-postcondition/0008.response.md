Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 1 and 5000, l is a list of integers, stdin is empty. If the value of q is equal to the value of i plus 1, then i is 0, j is 1, _ is 0, p is the first element of l, q is the element of l at index p - 1. Otherwise, the values of i, j, _, p, q remain unchanged.***
