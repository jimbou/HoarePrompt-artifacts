The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n distinct integers. It then checks for each test case if there exists an index p such that the element at index p-1 is equal to p. If such an index exists, it prints 2; otherwise, it prints 3. The function repeats this process for all test cases and does not return any value.
