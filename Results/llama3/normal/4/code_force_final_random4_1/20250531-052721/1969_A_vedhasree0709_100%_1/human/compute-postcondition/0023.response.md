Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is less than or equal to `n`, if `q` is equal to `i`, then `j` is 1, otherwise `j` is either 1 or remains unchanged, `_` is either 0 or remains unchanged, `p` is the element of `l` at index `i-1`, `q` is the element of `l` at index `p - 1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, and it is now less than or equal to `n`. The value of `p` is now the element of `l` at the previous index `i-1`, and the value of `q` is still the element of `l` at index `p - 1`. The values of `n`, `l`, `j`, and `_` remain unchanged.
