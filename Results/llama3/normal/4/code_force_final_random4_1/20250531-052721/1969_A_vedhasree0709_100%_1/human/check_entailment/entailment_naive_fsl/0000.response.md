Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input is:

4
2 3 4 1

The program will print 3, but the correct answer is 3 because Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2, and 3, and friends 1 and 2 will attend.

However, if the input is:

6
2 3 4 5 6 1

The program will print 3, but the correct answer is 4 because Monocarp needs to send invitations to friends 1, 2, 3, and 4 to ensure that at least 2 friends attend.

The program does not correctly handle cases where there are more than 2 pairs of best friends. It assumes that if it finds one pair of best friends, it can stop and print 2, but this is not always the case. It also assumes that if it doesn't find a pair of best friends, it needs to send invitations to 3 friends, but this is also not always the case.

A correct solution would need to consider all possible pairs of best friends and find the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure that at least 2 friends attend.
