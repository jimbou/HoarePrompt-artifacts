According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1. `n` being greater than 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 3, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, `p` is the element of `l` at index 2, `q` is the element of `l` at index `p - 1`, where `p` is the element of `l` at index 2, stdin is empty.**
