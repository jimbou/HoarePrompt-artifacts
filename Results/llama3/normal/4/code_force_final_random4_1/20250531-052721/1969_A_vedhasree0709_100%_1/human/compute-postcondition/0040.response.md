Output State: **n is greater than 1, l is a list of integers, i is 1, j is either 0 or 1, _ is 1, p is the element of l at index i, q is the element of l at index p - 1, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `l`, `i`, `j`, `_`, and stdin remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `p` is updated to be the element of `l` at index `i`, and the value of `q` is updated to be the element of `l` at index `p - 1`.
