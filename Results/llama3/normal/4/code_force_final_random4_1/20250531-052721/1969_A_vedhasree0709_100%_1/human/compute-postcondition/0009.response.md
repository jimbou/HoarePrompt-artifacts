Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is either 0 + 1 or remains unchanged, `j` is either 1 or remains unchanged, `_` is either 0 or remains unchanged, `p` is either the first element of `l` or remains unchanged, `q` is either the element of `l` at index `p - 1` or remains unchanged, stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains the same, `l` is still a list of integers, and the standard input is empty. The value of `i` is either incremented by 1 from its previous value of 0 or remains unchanged. If `i` was 0, then `j` is 1, `_` is 0, `p` is the first element of `l`, and `q` is the element of `l` at index `p - 1`. Otherwise, the values of `j`, `_`, `p`, and `q` remain unchanged.
