Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 5000, l is a list of integers, i is 0, j is 0, _ is 0, stdin is empty**

The code first reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`, which is now an integer between 1 and 5000. The second line reads a list of integers from stdin and assigns it to `l`. Since stdin initially contained an integer `t` and a list of integers, after these two lines, stdin is empty. The third and fourth lines initialize `i` and `j` to 0, respectively. The fifth line does not affect any variables. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0.
