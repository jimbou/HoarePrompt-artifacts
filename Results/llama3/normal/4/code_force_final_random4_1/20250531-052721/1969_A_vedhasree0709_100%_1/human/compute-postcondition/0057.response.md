Postcondition: **n is an integer, l is a list of integers, i is n, j is either 0 or 1, _ is 1, stdin is empty. If the loop executed at least once, then p is the last element of l and q is the element of l at index p - 1. If q is equal to n, then if j is 0, the number 3 is printed. If j is 1, the number 2 is printed. If q is not equal to n, then no number is printed.**
