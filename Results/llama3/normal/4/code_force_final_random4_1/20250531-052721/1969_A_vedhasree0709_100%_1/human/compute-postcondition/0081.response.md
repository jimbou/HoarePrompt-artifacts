The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now 3. The values of the other variables are not affected. `p` is still the element of `l` at index `i`, but since `i` has changed, `p` is now the element of `l` at index 3. `q` is still the element of `l` at index `p - 1`, but since `p` has changed, `q` is now the element of `l` at index `l[3] - 1`. The condition `q is equal to i + 1` is still valid, but since `i` has changed, the condition is now `l[l[3] - 1] is equal to 4`. If this condition is true, then `j` is still 1 and 2 is still printed. Otherwise, no additional changes are made.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is 3, `p` is the element of `l` at index 3, `q` is the element of `l` at index `l[3] - 1`. If `l[l[3] - 1]` is equal to 4, then `j` is 1 and 2 is printed.**
