Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to his friends so that at least 2 of them attend the party. The program iterates through each test case, checks if there exists an index p such that the element at index p-1 is equal to p, and prints 2 if such an index exists, otherwise it prints 3.

The program's logic is correct because it takes advantage of the fact that the input list p_i is a permutation of the numbers from 1 to n, and that each friend's best friend is distinct. If there exists an index p such that the element at index p-1 is equal to p, it means that the friends at indices p and p-1 are each other's best friends, and sending invitations to both of them will result in at least 2 friends attending the party. If no such index exists, it means that there are no pairs of friends who are each other's best friends, and sending invitations to at least 3 friends is required to guarantee that at least 2 friends attend the party.

The program's implementation is also correct, as it correctly reads the input, iterates through each test case, and prints the correct output based on the existence of the index p.

Correctness: **True**
