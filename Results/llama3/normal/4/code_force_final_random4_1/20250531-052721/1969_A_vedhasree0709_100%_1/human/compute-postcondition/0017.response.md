The variable in the loop head is variable i and n, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i and n.  If i is less than or equal to n - 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is less than or equal to n, So for the loop to be executed one more time i must be less than n.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is either 1 or remains unchanged, `_` is either 0 or remains unchanged, `p` is the element of `l` at index `i-1`, `q` is the element of `l` at index `p - 1`.**
