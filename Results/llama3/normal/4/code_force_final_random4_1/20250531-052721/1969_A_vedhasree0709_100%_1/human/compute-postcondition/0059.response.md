Output State: **n is an integer from stdin, l is a list of integers from stdin, i is 0, j is 0, _ is 0, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `n` is an integer read from stdin, replacing its original value. The list `l` now contains a list of integers read from stdin, overwriting its original value. The variables `i` and `j` are both reset to 0. The variable `_` remains unchanged at 0. Stdin is now empty after reading the input for `n` and `l`.
