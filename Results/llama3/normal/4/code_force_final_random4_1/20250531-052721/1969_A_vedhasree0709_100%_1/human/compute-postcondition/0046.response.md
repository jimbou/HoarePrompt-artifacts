To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `i` and `n` since they are the variables in the loop head.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, `_` is 1, `p` is the element of `l` at index 2, `q` is the element of `l` at index `p - 1`, if `q` is equal to 2 then `j` is 1, otherwise `j` is either 0 or 1, stdin is empty.**
