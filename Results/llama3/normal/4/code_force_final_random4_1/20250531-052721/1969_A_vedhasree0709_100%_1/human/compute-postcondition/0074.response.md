The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` was 1, so the new value of `i` is 2. The value of `p` is the element of `l` at index `i`, so the new value of `p` is the element of `l` at index 2. The value of `q` is the element of `l` at index `p - 1`, so the new value of `q` is the element of `l` at index `p - 1`, where `p` is the element of `l` at index 2. The value of `n` is still greater than 1. The list `l` is still a list of integers. The stdin is still empty. The condition "If q is equal to i + 1, then 2 is printed. Otherwise, no action is taken." is still valid, but it is not triggered because `q` is not equal to `i + 1` (since `i` is now 2 and `q` is the element of `l` at index `p - 1`, where `p` is the element of `l` at index 2).

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, `p` is the element of `l` at index 2, `q` is the element of `l` at index `p - 1`, where `p` is the element of `l` at index 2, stdin is empty.**
