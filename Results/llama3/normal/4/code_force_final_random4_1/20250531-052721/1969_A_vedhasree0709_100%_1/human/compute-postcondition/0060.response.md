To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `i <= n - 1`. The loop will execute if this condition is true.

Given the state right before the loop:

- `n` is an integer from stdin
- `l` is a list of integers from stdin (not relevant to the loop condition)
- `i` is 0
- `j` is 0 (not relevant to the loop condition)
- `_` is 0 (not relevant to the loop condition)
- stdin is empty (not relevant to the loop condition)

The condition `i <= n - 1` will be true if `n` is greater than or equal to 1 because `i` is 0. If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute because `0 <= 0 - 1` is false.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `n` is greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of integers from stdin, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `_` is 0, stdin is empty**
