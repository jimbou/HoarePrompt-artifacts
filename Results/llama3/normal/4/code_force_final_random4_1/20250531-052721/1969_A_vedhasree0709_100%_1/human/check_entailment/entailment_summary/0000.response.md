Reasoning:
The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to have at least 2 friends at his party.

The program iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it checks if there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends (i.e., the element at index p-1 is equal to p). If such a pair exists, it prints 2, indicating that Monocarp only needs to send invitations to these two friends. If no such pair exists, it prints 3, indicating that Monocarp needs to send invitations to at least three friends to have at least two friends at the party.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, and the output matches the expected results for the given example inputs.

Correctness: **True**
