Postcondition: ***n is greater than 0, l is a list of integers, i is 0, j is 0, _ is 1, p is the first element of l, q is the element of l at index p - 1, stdin is empty. If q is equal to i + 1, then j is set to 1 and the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
