Postcondition: ***n is an integer from stdin, l is a list of integers from stdin, i is n, j is 1 if there exists an index p such that l[p - 1] is equal to p, otherwise j is 0, p is the element of l at index n - 1, q is the element of l at index p - 1, where p is the element of l at index n - 1, stdin is empty. If there does not exist an index p such that l[p - 1] is equal to p, the number 3 is being printed.***
