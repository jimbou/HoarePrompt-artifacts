Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 5000, l is a list of integers, i is less than n, j is either 1 or remains unchanged, _ is either 0 or remains unchanged, p is the element of l at index i, q is the element of l at index p - 1.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `l`, `i`, `j`, and `_` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The only changes occur in the values of `p` and `q`. The first line assigns the element of `l` at index `i` to `p`, effectively updating its value. The second line assigns the element of `l` at index `p - 1` to `q`, also updating its value.
