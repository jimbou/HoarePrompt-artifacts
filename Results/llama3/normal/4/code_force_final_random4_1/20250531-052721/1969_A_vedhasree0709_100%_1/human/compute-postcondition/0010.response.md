According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 0 + 1 or remains unchanged, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000. `i` being either 0 + 1 or remains unchanged does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is less than or equal to `n - 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is less than or equal to `n - 1`, `j` is either 1 or remains unchanged, `_` is either 0 or remains unchanged, `p` is either the first element of `l` or remains unchanged, `q` is either the element of `l` at index `p - 1` or remains unchanged, stdin is empty.**
