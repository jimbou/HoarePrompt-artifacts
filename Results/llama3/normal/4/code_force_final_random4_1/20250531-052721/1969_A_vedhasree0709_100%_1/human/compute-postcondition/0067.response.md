The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` is 0, so the new value of `i` is 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The value of `j` is still 1 if the element of `l` at index `p - 1` is equal to `i + 1`, which is now 2, otherwise `j` is 0. The value of `p` is still the first element of `l`, and the value of `q` is still the element of `l` at index `p - 1`. The stdin is still empty.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `j` is 1 if the element of `l` at index `p - 1` is equal to 2, otherwise `j` is 0, `p` is the first element of `l`, `q` is the element of `l` at index `p - 1`, stdin is empty.**
