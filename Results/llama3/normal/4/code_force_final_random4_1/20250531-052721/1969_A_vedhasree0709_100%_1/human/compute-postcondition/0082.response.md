Output State: **n is an integer from stdin, l is a list of integers from stdin, i is n, j is 1 if there exists an index p such that l[p - 1] is equal to p, otherwise j is 0, p is the element of l at index n - 1, q is the element of l at index p - 1, where p is the element of l at index n - 1, stdin is empty.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows: the value of `n` remains unchanged, the list `l` remains unchanged, the value of `i` is equal to `n`, the value of `j` is 1 if there exists an index `p` such that `l[p - 1]` is equal to `p`, otherwise `j` is 0, the value of `p` is the element of `l` at index `n - 1`, the value of `q` is the element of `l` at index `p - 1`, where `p` is the element of `l` at index `n - 1`, and the standard input `stdin` is empty.
