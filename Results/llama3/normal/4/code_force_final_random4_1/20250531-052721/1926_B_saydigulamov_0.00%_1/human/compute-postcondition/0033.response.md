Output State: **`a` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `_` is equal to `int(input()) - 1`, `b` is the new input string. If '1' is in string `b`, then `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in string `b` repeated `int(input())` times and the count of '1' in string `b` is appended to `k`. Otherwise, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in string `b` repeated `int(input()) - 1` times, stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `a` remains an integer greater than 1, and the value of `i` remains 1. The value of `_` remains equal to `int(input()) - 1`. The value of `b` is updated to the new input string. The value of `k` is updated based on whether '1' is in the new input string `b`. If '1' is in `b`, then `k` contains the count of '1' in `b` repeated `int(input())` times, and the count of '1' in `b` is appended to `k`. If '1' is not in `b`, then `k` contains the count of '1' in `b` repeated `int(input()) - 1` times. The stdin is now empty, containing no input.
