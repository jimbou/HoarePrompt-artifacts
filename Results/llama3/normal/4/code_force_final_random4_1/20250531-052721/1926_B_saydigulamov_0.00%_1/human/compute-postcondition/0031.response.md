Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `int(input())` is greater than 1, `_` is equal to `int(input()) - 2`, `b` is the new input string. If '1' is in string `b`, then `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in string `b` repeated `int(input())` times and the count of '1' in string `b` is appended to `k`. Otherwise, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in string `b` repeated `int(input()) - 1` times.***
