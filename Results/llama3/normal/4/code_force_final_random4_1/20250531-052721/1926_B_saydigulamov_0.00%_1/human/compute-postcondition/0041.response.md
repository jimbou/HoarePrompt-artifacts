State: **`a` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `_` is equal to 0, `b` is the new input string, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in string `b` repeated `int(input())` times and the count of '1' in string `b` is appended to `k` `int(input()) - 1` times. If the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`, the list `k` is printed.**
