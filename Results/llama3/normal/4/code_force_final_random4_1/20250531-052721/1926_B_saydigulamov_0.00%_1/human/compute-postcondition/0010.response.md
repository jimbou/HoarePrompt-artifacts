The code `k.append(b.count('1'))` appends the count of '1' in string `b` to the list `k`. 

Since `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in string `b` if '1' is in string `b`, otherwise, `k` is an empty list, we have two cases:

1. If '1' is in string `b`, then `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in string `b`. After executing the code, `k` will be a list containing the count of '1' in string `b` twice, because `b.count('1')` is appended to `k`.

2. If '1' is not in string `b`, then `k` is an empty list. After executing the code, `k` will be a list containing 0, because `b.count('1')` is 0 and it is appended to `k`.

The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`a` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `int(input())` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `b` is a string, if '1' is in string `b`, then `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in string `b` twice, otherwise, `k` is a list containing 0.**
