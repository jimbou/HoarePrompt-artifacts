Output State: **`a` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `_` is 1, `b` is a string containing a non-zero integer, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in `b`**.

In this output state, the value of `k` is updated to include the count of '1' in string `b`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin is still empty.
