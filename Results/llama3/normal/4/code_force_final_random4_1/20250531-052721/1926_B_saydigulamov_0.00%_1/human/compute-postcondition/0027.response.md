Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `int(input())` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `int(input()) - 1`, `b` is either '1' or any other input string, stdin contains no input. If '1' is in string `b`, then `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in string `b` repeated `int(input())` times. Otherwise, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in string `b` repeated `int(input()) - 1` times.***
