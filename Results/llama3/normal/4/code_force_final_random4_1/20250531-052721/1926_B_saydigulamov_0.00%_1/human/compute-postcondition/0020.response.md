Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `int(input())` is greater than or equal to 0, `_` is equal to `int(input()) - 1`, `b` is a string, stdin contains no input. If '1' is in string `b`, then `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in string `b` repeated `int(input())` times, otherwise, `k` is a list containing 0 repeated `int(input())` times. If the first two elements of `k` are equal, then `k` is printed.***
