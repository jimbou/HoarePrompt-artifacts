To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `_` and the input from `stdin`.

Since the loop condition is `range(int(input()))`, the loop will execute if the input from `stdin` is a non-zero integer. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `stdin` to contain a non-zero integer.

The variable `_` is used as the loop variable, but its initial value is not relevant to the loop execution. However, since `_` is equal to 0 initially, we can adjust its state to be equal to 0, which is the first value it will take in the loop.

The other variables `a`, `i`, `b`, and `k` are not relevant to the loop execution and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`a` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `_` is 0, `b` is the new input string, `k` is an empty list, stdin contains a non-zero integer**
