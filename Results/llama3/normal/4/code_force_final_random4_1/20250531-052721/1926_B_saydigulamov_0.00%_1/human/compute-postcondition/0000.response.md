Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains `a` test cases. Each test case contains an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 10) followed by `n` lines each containing `n` characters 0 or 1.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 100 (inclusive). The remaining input in stdin still contains `a` test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 10) followed by `n` lines of `n` characters each, where the characters are either 0 or 1.
