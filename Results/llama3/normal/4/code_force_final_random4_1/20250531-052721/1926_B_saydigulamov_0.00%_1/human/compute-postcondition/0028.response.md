The only variables in the loop head are variables  `_` and `int(input())`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `int(input())`. If `_` is less than `int(input())`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is equal to `int(input()) - 1` and `int(input())` is greater than 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time `_` must be equal to `int(input()) - 2` and `int(input())` must be greater than 1.
State: **`a` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `int(input())` is greater than 1, `_` is equal to `int(input()) - 2`, `b` is either '1' or any other input string, stdin contains no input. If '1' is in string `b`, then `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in string `b` repeated `int(input())` times. Otherwise, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in string `b` repeated `int(input()) - 1` times.**
