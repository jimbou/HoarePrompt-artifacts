The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `a` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `a` must be greater than 1.
State: **`a` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `int(input())` is greater than or equal to 0, `_` is equal to `int(input()) - 1`, `b` is a string, stdin contains no input. If '1' is in string `b`, then `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in string `b` repeated `int(input())` times, otherwise, `k` is a list containing 0 repeated `int(input())` times. If the first two elements of `k` are equal, then `k` is printed.**
