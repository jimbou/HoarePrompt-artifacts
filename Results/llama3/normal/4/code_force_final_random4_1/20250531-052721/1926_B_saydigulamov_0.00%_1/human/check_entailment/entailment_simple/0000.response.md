Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The program checks if the first and second counts of '1' in the input strings are equal, and if they are, it prints the list of counts of '1' in each input string that contains '1'. However, this is not the correct logic to determine whether the shape is a square or a triangle.

To determine whether the shape is a square or a triangle, the program should check the pattern of '1's in the input strings. For a square, the number of '1's in each row should be the same, and for a triangle, the number of '1's in each row should increase or decrease by 2.

The program does not correctly implement this logic, and therefore, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
