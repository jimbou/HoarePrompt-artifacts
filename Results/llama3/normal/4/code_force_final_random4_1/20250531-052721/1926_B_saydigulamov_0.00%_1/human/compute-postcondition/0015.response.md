Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `int(input())` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `b` is a string, stdin contains no input. If '1' is in string `b`, then `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in string `b` three times, otherwise, `k` is a list containing 0 three times.***
