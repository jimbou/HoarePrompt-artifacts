The code prints the list `k`, which contains the count of '1' in each input string that contains '1'. Since the current value of `k[0]` is equal to the current value of `k[1]`, the list `k` contains two equal elements.

Output: **[k[0], k[1]] (where k[0] and k[1] are the counts of '1' in the first and second input strings respectively, and k[0] is equal to k[1])**
