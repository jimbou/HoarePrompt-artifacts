The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case contains a square matrix of 0s and 1s. It counts the number of 1s in each row of the matrix, but only if the row contains at least one 1. If the first and second rows have the same count of 1s, it prints the list of counts of 1s for all rows that contain 1s. The function repeats this process for multiple test cases.
