The only variables in the loop head are variables  `_` and `int(input())`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `int(input())`. If `int(input())` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is an empty list does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `int(input())` is greater than 0 and `_` is now 0. 
State: **`a` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is an empty list, `int(input())` is greater than 0, `_` is 0**
