The code `k.append(b.count('1'))` appends the count of '1' in `b` to the list `k`. Since `b` is an integer greater than 1, we can't directly count '1' in it. However, we can assume that `b` is a string representation of an integer, and we can count the occurrences of '1' in it.

The value of `k` is either a list containing the count of '1' in `b` or an empty list. After appending the count of '1' in `b` to `k`, the value of `k` will be a list containing the count of '1' in `b`.

The values of the other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`a` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `_` is 2, `b` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in `b`.**
