Reasoning:

The given program is not correct. Here's why:

1. The program only checks if the first two rows have the same number of '1's. This is not sufficient to determine if the shape is a square or a triangle.

2. The program does not check the position of the '1's in each row. For a square, the '1's should be positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid, while for a triangle, the '1's should be positioned in a way that forms a triangle.

3. The program does not handle the case where the shape is a triangle. It only checks for squares and prints the count of '1's in the first two rows if they are equal.

4. The program does not print "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" as required by the problem statement.

5. The program does not handle the case where the input grid does not contain any '1's.

6. The program does not handle the case where the input grid contains multiple shapes.

7. The program does not handle the case where the input grid contains a shape that is not a square or a triangle.

8. The program does not handle the case where the input grid is not a square.

9. The program does not handle the case where the input grid is empty.

10. The program does not handle the case where the input is not a valid grid.

Correctness: **False**
