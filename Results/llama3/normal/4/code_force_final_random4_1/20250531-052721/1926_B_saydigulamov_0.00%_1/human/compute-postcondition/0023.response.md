To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `int(input())`. The loop will execute if `int(input())` is greater than 0.

State: **`a` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `int(input())` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `int(input()) - 1`, `b` is a string, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in string `b` repeated `int(input()) - 1` times if '1' is in string `b`, otherwise, `k` is a list containing 0 repeated `int(input()) - 1` times, stdin contains '1' or any other input**
