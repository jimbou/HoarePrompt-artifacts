Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `_` is equal to `int(input()) - 1`, `b` is the new input string. If '1' is in string `b`, then `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in string `b` repeated `int(input())` times and the count of '1' in string `b` is appended to `k` twice. If '1' is not in string `b`, then `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in string `b` repeated `int(input()) - 1` times and the count of '1' in string `b` is appended to `k` once. In both cases, stdin contains no input.***
