Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is `a - 1`, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in each input string that contains '1'. If the first and second counts of '1' in the input strings are equal, the list of counts of '1' in each input string that contains '1' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has processed all the test cases, and for each test case, it has counted the number of '1's in each input string that contains '1'. If the first and second counts of '1' in the input strings are equal, the list of counts of '1' in each input string that contains '1' is printed. The loop has iterated `a` times, and the value of `i` is now `a - 1`.
