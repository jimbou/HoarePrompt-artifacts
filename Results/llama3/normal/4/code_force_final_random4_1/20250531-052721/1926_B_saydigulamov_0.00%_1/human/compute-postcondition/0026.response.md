Output State: **`a` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `int(input())` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `int(input()) - 1`, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in string `b` repeated `int(input())` times, `b` is '1', stdin contains no input.**

The code `k.append(b.count('1'))` appends the count of '1' in string `b` to the list `k`. Since `b` is '1', the count of '1' is 1. Therefore, the list `k` now contains the count of '1' in string `b` repeated `int(input())` times. The values of the other variables are not affected.
