Output State: **`a` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `_` is equal to `int(input()) - 1`, `b` is the new input string. If '1' is in string `b`, then `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in string `b` repeated `int(input())` times and the count of '1' in string `b` is appended to `k` twice. Otherwise, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in string `b` repeated `int(input()) - 1` times and the count of '1' in string `b` is appended to `k` once, stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `a` remains an integer greater than 1, `i` remains 1, and `_` remains equal to `int(input()) - 1`. The value of `b` remains the new input string. The list `k` has been updated by appending the count of '1' in string `b`. If '1' is in string `b`, then `k` now contains the count of '1' in string `b` repeated `int(input())` times and the count of '1' in string `b` is appended to `k` twice. If '1' is not in string `b`, then `k` now contains the count of '1' in string `b` repeated `int(input()) - 1` times and the count of '1' in string `b` is appended to `k` once. The stdin remains empty.
