Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The program only checks if the first and second rows have the same count of 1s, and if so, it prints the list of counts of 1s for all rows that contain 1s. However, this is not sufficient to determine whether the shape is a square or a triangle.

To correctly determine the shape, the program should check the pattern of 1s in the entire grid, not just the first two rows. For a square, the number of 1s in each row should be the same, and the position of the 1s should be at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid. For a triangle, the number of 1s in each row should increase or decrease by 2, and the position of the 1s should be centered.

The program does not perform these checks, and therefore, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
