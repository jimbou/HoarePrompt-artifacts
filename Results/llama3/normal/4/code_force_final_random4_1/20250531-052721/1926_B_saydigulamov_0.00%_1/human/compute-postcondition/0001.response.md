To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. If `a` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), we can adjust the state of `a` to be greater than 0. We also need to adjust the state of `i` to be 0, which is the starting value of the range.

State: **`a` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0**
