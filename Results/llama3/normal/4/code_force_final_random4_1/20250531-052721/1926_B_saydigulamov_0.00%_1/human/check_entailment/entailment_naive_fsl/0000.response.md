Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly identify whether the shape in the grid is a square or a triangle. The condition `if k[0] == k[1]:` is not sufficient to determine if the shape is a square or a triangle. 

For example, if the input is:
```
3
000
011
011
```
The program will print `[2, 2]` but it will not print "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE". 

Also, the program does not check if the shape is a triangle. It only checks if the first two rows have the same number of '1's, which is not enough to determine if the shape is a square or a triangle.

To correctly solve this problem, the program should check the number of '1's in each row and their positions to determine if the shape is a square or a triangle.
