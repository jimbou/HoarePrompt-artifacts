Output State: **t is at least 1, _ is 0, p1 is an integer between 0 and 30, p2 is an integer between 0 and 30 and p2 is greater than or equal to p1, p3 is an integer between 0 and 30 and p3 is greater than or equal to p2, p3 is less than p1 + p2, x is 1, and y is p3 - 1, and p1 - x is greater than p2 - y**

The code increments `x` by 1 and decrements `y` by 1. Since `x` was initially 0, it becomes 1. Since `y` was initially `p3`, it becomes `p3 - 1`. The relationship between `p1`, `p2`, `x`, and `y` is maintained, as `p1 - x` is still greater than `p2 - y`. All other variables remain unchanged.
