Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `p1` is an integer between 0 and 30, `p2` is an integer between 0 and 30 and `p2` is greater than or equal to `p1`, `p3` is an integer between 0 and 30 and `p3` is greater than or equal to `p2`, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`. If `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, `x` is 0, and `y` is `p3`. Otherwise, `x` is 1, `y` is `p3 - 1`, and `p1 - x` is greater than `p2 - y`***
