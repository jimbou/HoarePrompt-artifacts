Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly handles the cases where the sum of the scores is odd, where the highest score is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores, and where the scores need to be adjusted iteratively to find the maximum possible score. The program also correctly prints -1 when the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games and results.

The program's logic is sound, and it covers all the possible scenarios mentioned in the problem description. The use of a while loop to adjust the scores iteratively is also correct, as it ensures that the scores are adjusted in a way that maximizes the number of draws.

The program's output matches the expected output for the given examples, which further confirms its correctness.

Correctness: **True**
