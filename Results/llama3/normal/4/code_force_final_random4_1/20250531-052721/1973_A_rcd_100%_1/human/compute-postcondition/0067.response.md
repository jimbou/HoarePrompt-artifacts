Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers between 0 and 30, `p1` is less than or equal to `p2`, `p2` is less than or equal to `p3`, stdin contains no input**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged. However, the values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are updated to be the three integers read from the input, which are between 0 and 30. The condition that `p1` is less than or equal to `p2`, and `p2` is less than or equal to `p3` is still valid. Since the input is read from stdin, it is now empty.
