Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers between 0 and 30, `p1` is less than or equal to `p2`, `p2` is less than or equal to `p3`, `p3` must be greater than 1. If `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`, the value of `p1 - x + p3` is printed and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, `x` is increased by 1 and `y` is decreased by 1.***
