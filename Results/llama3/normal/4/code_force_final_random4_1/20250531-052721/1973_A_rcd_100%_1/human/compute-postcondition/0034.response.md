Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `p1` is an integer between 0 and 30, `p2` is an integer between 0 and 30 and `p2` is greater than or equal to `p1`, `p3` is an integer between 0 and 30 and `p3` is greater than or equal to `p2`. If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is an even number and `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, then the sum of `p1` and `p2` is printed. If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is an odd number, the program skips to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `x` is set to `p3` and `y` is set to 0.***
