Output State: **t is at least 2, _ is 1, p1, p2, p3 are integers between 0 and 30, p1 is less than or equal to p2, p2 is less than or equal to p3, p3 is greater than or equal to 0, x is 3, y is greater than or equal to 1**

The code increments `x` by 1 and decrements `y` by 1. Since `x` was 2, it becomes 3. Since `y` was greater than or equal to 2, it becomes greater than or equal to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
