Output State: **t is at least 1, _ is 0, p1 is an integer between 0 and 30, p2 is an integer between 0 and 30 and p2 is greater than or equal to p1, p3 is an integer between 0 and 30 and p3 is greater than or equal to p2, p3 is less than p1 + p2, x is p3, y is 0.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has terminated, and the values of x and y have been updated to x = p3 and y = 0. The values of the other variables (t, _, p1, p2, and p3) remain unchanged.
