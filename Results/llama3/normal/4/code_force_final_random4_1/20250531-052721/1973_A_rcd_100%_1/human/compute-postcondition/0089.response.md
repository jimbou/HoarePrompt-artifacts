The variables in the loop head are `y` and `x`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `y` and `x`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is decreased by 1 and `x` is increased by 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time `y` must be greater than or equal to `x` after the last iteration. Since `y` is decreased by 1 and `x` is increased by 1, `y` must be greater than `x` before the last iteration.
State: **`t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers between 0 and 30, `p1` is less than or equal to `p2`, `p2` is less than or equal to `p3`, `p3` must be greater than 1, `y` must be greater than `x`**
