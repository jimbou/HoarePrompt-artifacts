Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers between 0 and 30, `p1` is less than or equal to `p2`, `p2` is less than or equal to `p3`, stdin contains no input. If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, then -1 is printed. If `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1` + `p2`, the sum of `p1` and `p2` is printed. Otherwise, `p3` must be greater than 1, and `x` is equal to `y`, which is equal to `p3 - 1` or `p3 - 2` or `p3 - 3` or ... or `0`.***
