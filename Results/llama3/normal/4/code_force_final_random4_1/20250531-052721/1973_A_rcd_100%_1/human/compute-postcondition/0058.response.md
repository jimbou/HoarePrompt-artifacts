The variables in the loop head are `x` and `y`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x` and `y`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 2 and `y` is greater than or equal to 0. `y` being greater than or equal to 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `y` is greater than or equal to 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers between 0 and 30, `p1` is less than or equal to `p2`, `p2` is less than or equal to `p3`, `p3` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is 2, `y` is greater than or equal to 2**
