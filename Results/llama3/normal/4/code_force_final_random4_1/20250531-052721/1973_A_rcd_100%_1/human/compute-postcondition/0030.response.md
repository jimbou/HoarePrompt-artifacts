Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `p1` is an integer between 0 and 30, `p2` is an integer between 0 and 30 and `p2` is greater than or equal to `p1`, `p3` is an integer between 0 and 30 and `p3` is greater than or equal to `p2`, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`. If `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `x` is 1, `y` is greater than or equal to 1. Otherwise, `x` is 2, and `y` is greater than or equal to 2. and this is printed: p1 - x + p3, where p1 is an integer between 0 and 30, x is either 1 or 2, and p3 is an integer between 0 and 30 and p3 is greater than or equal to p2, p3 is less than p1 + p2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the additional information that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `t`, `_`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `x`, and `y` remain the same, and the condition `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y` is still valid. The expression `p1 - x + p3` is printed, where `p1`, `x`, and `p3` have the same values as before.
