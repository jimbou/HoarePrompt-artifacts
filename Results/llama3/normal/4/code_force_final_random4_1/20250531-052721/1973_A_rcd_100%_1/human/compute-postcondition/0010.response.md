Output: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `p1` is an integer between 0 and 30, `p2` is an integer between 0 and 30 and `p2` is greater than or equal to `p1`, `p3` is an integer between 0 and 30 and `p3` is greater than or equal to `p2`. If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is an even number, the current value of `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, and the sum of `p1` and `p2` is being printed**
