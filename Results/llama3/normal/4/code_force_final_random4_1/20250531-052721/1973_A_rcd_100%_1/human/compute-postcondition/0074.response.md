Output State: **t is at least 3, _ is 2, p1, p2, p3 are integers between 0 and 30, p1 is less than or equal to p2, p2 is less than or equal to p3, x is 0, y is equal to p3, stdin contains no input. If the sum of p1, p2, and p3 is odd, then -1 is printed.**

The code snippet consists of two lines, both of which assign values to new variables. The first line assigns 0 to x, and the second line assigns the value of p3 to y. Since p3 is an integer between 0 and 30, y also becomes an integer between 0 and 30. The values of t, _, p1, p2, and p3 remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The condition regarding the sum of p1, p2, and p3 being odd and printing -1 is not affected by the code, as it is a separate condition that does not impact the values of the variables.
