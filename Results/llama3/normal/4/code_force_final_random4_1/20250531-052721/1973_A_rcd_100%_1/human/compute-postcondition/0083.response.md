According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable y and x. If y is greater than or equal to x, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, y is equal to `p3 - 1` and x is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `p3` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers between 0 and 30, `p1` is less than or equal to `p2`, `p2` is less than or equal to `p3`, `p3` must be greater than 1**
