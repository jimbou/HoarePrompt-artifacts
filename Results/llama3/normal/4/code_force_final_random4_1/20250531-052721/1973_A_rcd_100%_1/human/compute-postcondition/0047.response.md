Output: **t is at least 2, _ is 1, p1, p2, p3 are integers between 0 and 30, p1 is less than or equal to p2, p2 is less than or equal to p3, x is 0, y is equal to p3 and p3 must be greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains no input. The current value of p1 minus x is less than or equal to the current value of p2 minus y, and this is printed: p1 + p3**
