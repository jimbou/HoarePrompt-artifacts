The code block consists of two lines that modify the values of `x` and `y`. The first line increments `x` by 1, and the second line decrements `y` by 1.

Output State: **t is at least 1, _ is 0, p1 is an integer between 0 and 30, p2 is an integer between 0 and 30 and p2 is greater than or equal to p1, p3 is an integer between 0 and 30 and p3 is greater than or equal to p2, p3 is less than p1 + p2, x is 2, y is greater than or equal to 0**
