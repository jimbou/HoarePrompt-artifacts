Output State: **`t` is 0, `_` is `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers between 0 and 30, `p1` is less than or equal to `p2`, `p2` is less than or equal to `p3`, stdin contains no input. If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, then -1 is printed. If `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1` + `p2`, the sum of `p1` and `p2` is printed. Otherwise, `p3` must be greater than 1, and `x` is equal to `y`, which is equal to `p3 - 1` or `p3 - 2` or `p3 - 3` or ... or `0`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the value of `t` has been decremented to 0. The values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are still integers between 0 and 30, and `p1` is less than or equal to `p2`, which is less than or equal to `p3`. The standard input `stdin` is empty, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The output of the program depends on the values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. If their sum is odd, -1 is printed. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the sum of `p1` and `p2` is printed. Otherwise, `p3` must be greater than 1, and the values of `x` and `y` are equal, ranging from `p3 - 1` to 0.
