Based on the initial state, we can analyze the print statement as follows:

The print statement is `print(p1 - x + p3)`. We need to determine the values of `p1`, `x`, and `p3` based on the given conditions.

From the initial state, we know that `p1` is an integer between 0 and 30, `p2` is an integer between 0 and 30 and `p2` is greater than or equal to `p1`, and `p3` is an integer between 0 and 30 and `p3` is greater than or equal to `p2`. We also know that `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`.

The value of `x` depends on the condition `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`. If this condition is true, then `x` is 1, and `y` is greater than or equal to 1. Otherwise, `x` is 2, and `y` is greater than or equal to 2.

Since we don't have explicit values for `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `p1 - x + p3`. However, based on the structure of the problem, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **p1 - x + p3 (where p1 is an integer between 0 and 30, x is either 1 or 2 depending on the condition p1 - x is less than or equal to p2 - y, and p3 is an integer between 0 and 30 and greater than or equal to p2)**
