Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `p1` is an integer between 0 and 30, `p2` is an integer between 0 and 30 and `p2` is greater than or equal to `p1`, `p3` is an integer between 0 and 30 and `p3` is greater than or equal to `p2`, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, `x` is 1, `y` is greater than or equal to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code `break` does not change the values of any variables. It only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement that it is directly inside. Therefore, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the loop or if statement, which is reflected in the output state.
