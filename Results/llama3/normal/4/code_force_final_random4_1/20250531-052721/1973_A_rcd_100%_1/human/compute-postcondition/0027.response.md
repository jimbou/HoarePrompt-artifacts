According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable y and x. If y is greater than or equal to x, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, y is greater than or equal to 1 and x is 1 or 2. If x is 1, y is greater than or equal to 1, so the loop can execute again. If x is 2, y is greater than or equal to 0, so y needs to be adjusted to y is greater than or equal to 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `p1` is an integer between 0 and 30, `p2` is an integer between 0 and 30 and `p2` is greater than or equal to `p1`, `p3` is an integer between 0 and 30 and `p3` is greater than or equal to `p2`, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`. If `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `x` is 1, `y` is greater than or equal to 1. Otherwise, `x` is 2, and `y` is greater than or equal to 2.**
