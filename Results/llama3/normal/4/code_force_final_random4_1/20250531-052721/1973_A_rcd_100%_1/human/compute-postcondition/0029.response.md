Output: ** `t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `p1` is an integer between 0 and 30, `p2` is an integer between 0 and 30 and `p2` is greater than or equal to `p1`, `p3` is an integer between 0 and 30 and `p3` is greater than or equal to `p2`, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`. If `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `x` is 1, `y` is greater than or equal to 1. Otherwise, `x` is 2, and `y` is greater than or equal to 2. and this is printed: p1 - x + p3, where p1 is an integer between 0 and 30, x is either 1 or 2, and p3 is an integer between 0 and 30 and p3 is greater than or equal to p2, p3 is less than p1 + p2.**
