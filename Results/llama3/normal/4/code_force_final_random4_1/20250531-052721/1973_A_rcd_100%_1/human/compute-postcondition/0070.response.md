The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop and moves to the next iteration. In this case, since there is no loop specified, the `continue` statement has no effect on the variables or the program state.

Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers between 0 and 30, `p1` is less than or equal to `p2`, `p2` is less than or equal to `p3`, stdin contains no input, and -1 is being printed.**
