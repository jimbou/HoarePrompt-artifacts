Output: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers between 0 and 30, `p1` is less than or equal to `p2`, `p2` is less than or equal to `p3`, stdin contains no input. If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, -1 is printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no action is taken. and the sum of `p1` and `p2` is being printed**
