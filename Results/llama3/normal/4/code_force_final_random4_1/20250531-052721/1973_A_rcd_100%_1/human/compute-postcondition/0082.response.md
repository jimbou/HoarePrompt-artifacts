Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers between 0 and 30, `p1` is less than or equal to `p2`, `p2` is less than or equal to `p3`. If `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `x` is 1, `y` is equal to `p3 - 1`, and `p1 - x` is greater than or equal to `p2 - y`.***
