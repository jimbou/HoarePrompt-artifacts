Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `p1` is an integer between 0 and 30, `p2` is an integer between 0 and 30 and `p2` is greater than or equal to `p1`, `p3` is an integer between 0 and 30 and `p3` is greater than or equal to `p2`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged. The variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are assigned the values of the three integers from the input, which are between 0 and 30 and sorted non-decreasingly. The stdin now contains one less test case.
