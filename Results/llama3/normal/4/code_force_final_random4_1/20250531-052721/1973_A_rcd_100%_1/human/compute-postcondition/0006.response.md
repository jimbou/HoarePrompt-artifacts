Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `p1` is an integer between 0 and 30, `p2` is an integer between 0 and 30 and `p2` is greater than or equal to `p1`, `p3` is an integer between 0 and 30 and `p3` is greater than or equal to `p2`. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is an odd number, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the additional information that we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. The values of the variables `t`, `_`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is still an odd number.
