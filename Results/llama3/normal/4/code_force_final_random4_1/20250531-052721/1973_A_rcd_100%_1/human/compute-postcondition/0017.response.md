Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `p1` is an integer between 0 and 30, `p2` is an integer between 0 and 30 and `p2` is greater than or equal to `p1`, `p3` is an integer between 0 and 30 and `p3` is greater than or equal to `p2`, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, `x` is 0, `y` is `p3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all the variables maintain their initial values and conditions, as the `break` statement only exits the innermost loop or if statement without modifying any variables. The sum of `p1` and `p3` has been printed, but this does not affect the values of the variables.
