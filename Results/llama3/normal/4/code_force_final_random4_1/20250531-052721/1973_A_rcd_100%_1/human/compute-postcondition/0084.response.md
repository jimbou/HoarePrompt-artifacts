The code prints the result of the expression `p1 - x + p3`. Based on the precondition, we know that `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers between 0 and 30, and `p1` is less than or equal to `p2`, which is less than or equal to `p3`. We also know that `p3` must be greater than 1.

However, the value of `x` is not explicitly defined in the precondition. Since `x` is not defined, we cannot determine its value.

Therefore, the output will be the result of the expression `p1 - x + p3`, where `p1` and `p3` are integers between 0 and 30, and `p3` is greater than 1, but the value of `x` is unknown.

Output: **p1 - x + p3 (where p1 and p3 are integers between 0 and 30, p3 is greater than 1, and x is an unknown value)**
