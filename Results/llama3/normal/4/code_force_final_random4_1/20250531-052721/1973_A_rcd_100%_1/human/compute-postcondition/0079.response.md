Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers between 0 and 30, `p1` is less than or equal to `p2`, `p2` is less than or equal to `p3`, `x` is 0, `y` is equal to `p3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. The initial state conditions that are still valid after the code has been executed are included in the output state.
