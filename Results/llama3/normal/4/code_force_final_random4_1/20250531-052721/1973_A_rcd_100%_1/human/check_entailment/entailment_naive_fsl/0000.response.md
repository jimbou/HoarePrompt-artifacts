Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when p1, p2, and p3 are all equal and greater than 0. In this case, the program will print p1 + p2, which is incorrect because it does not consider the possibility that the games between the players could have ended in draws.

For example, if the input is (3, 3, 3), the program will print 6, but the correct answer is -1 because it is not possible to obtain these scores with any number of games between the three players.

The program should be modified to handle this case and print -1 when p1, p2, and p3 are all equal and greater than 0.
