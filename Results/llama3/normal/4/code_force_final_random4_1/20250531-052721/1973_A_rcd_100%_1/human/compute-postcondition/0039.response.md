Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers between 0 and 30, `p1` is less than or equal to `p2`, `p2` is less than or equal to `p3`, stdin contains no input, -1 is being printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `t`, `_`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged, and the conditions on their values are still valid. The stdin still contains no input, and -1 is still being printed. The only change is that we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement.
