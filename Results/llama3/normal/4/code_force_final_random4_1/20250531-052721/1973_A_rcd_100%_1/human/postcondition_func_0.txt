This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers representing the scores of three players. It then determines and prints the maximum possible score that can be achieved by rearranging the scores, considering the constraints that the sum of the scores must be even and the scores must be non-decreasing. If the sum of the scores is odd, it prints -1. If the highest score is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores, it prints the sum of the two lower scores. Otherwise, it calculates and prints the maximum possible score by iteratively adjusting the scores.
