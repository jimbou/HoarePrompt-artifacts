Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers between 0 and 30, `p1` is less than or equal to `p2`, `p2` is less than or equal to `p3`, `p3` must be greater than 1. If `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `x` is incremented by 1, `y` is decremented by 1, and `y` is still greater than `x`.***
