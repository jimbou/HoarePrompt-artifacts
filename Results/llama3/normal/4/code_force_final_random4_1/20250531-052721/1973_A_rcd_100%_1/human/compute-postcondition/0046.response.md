The code prints the sum of the values of `p1`, `p3`, and the negation of `x`. Since `x` is 0, the negation of `x` is also 0. Therefore, the sum is simply the sum of `p1` and `p3`.

Output: **p1 + p3 (where p1 and p3 are integers between 0 and 30, and p1 is less than or equal to p2, which is less than or equal to p3)**
