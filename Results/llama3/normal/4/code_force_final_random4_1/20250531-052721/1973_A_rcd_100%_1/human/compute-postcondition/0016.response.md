Output: ** `t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `p1` is an integer between 0 and 30, `p2` is an integer between 0 and 30 and `p2` is greater than or equal to `p1`, `p3` is an integer between 0 and 30 and `p3` is greater than or equal to `p2`, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, `x` is 0, `y` is `p3`. The current value of `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`, and the sum of `p1` and `p3` is being printed**
