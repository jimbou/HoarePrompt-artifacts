The code prints the sum of `p1`, `p3`, and the negation of `x`. Since `x` is 0, the negation of `x` is also 0. Therefore, the expression `p1 - x` is equal to `p1`. 
Since `p1` is an integer between 0 and 30 and `p3` is an integer between 0 and 30, the sum of `p1` and `p3` is an integer between 0 and 60.
Output: **an integer between 0 and 60 (which is the sum of p1 and p3)**
