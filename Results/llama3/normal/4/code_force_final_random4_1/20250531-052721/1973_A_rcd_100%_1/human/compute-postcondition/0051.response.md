Postcondition: ***t is at least 2, _ is 1, p1, p2, p3 are integers between 0 and 30, p1 is less than or equal to p2, p2 is less than or equal to p3, p3 is greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains no input. If p1 - x is less than or equal to p2 - y, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, x is 1, y is equal to p3 - 1, and p1 - x is greater than p2 - y.***
