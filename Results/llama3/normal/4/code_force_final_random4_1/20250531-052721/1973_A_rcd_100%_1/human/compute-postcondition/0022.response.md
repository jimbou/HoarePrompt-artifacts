The code prints the value of the expression `p1 - x + p3`. 

Here, `p1` is an integer between 0 and 30, `x` is 1, and `p3` is an integer between 0 and 30 and `p3` is greater than or equal to `p2` and `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`.

Since `x` is 1, the expression can be simplified to `p1 - 1 + p3`. 

The value of `p1 - 1` will be an integer between -1 and 29, and the value of `p3` will be an integer between 0 and 30.

Therefore, the value of `p1 - 1 + p3` will be an integer between -1 and 59.

Output: **an integer between -1 and 59 (where the integer is p1 - 1 + p3)**
