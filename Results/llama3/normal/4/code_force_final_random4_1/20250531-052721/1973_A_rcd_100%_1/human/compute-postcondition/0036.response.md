Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers between 0 and 30, `p1` is less than or equal to `p2`, `p2` is less than or equal to `p3`, stdin contains no input**.

In this output state, the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged. The values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are updated to be integers between 0 and 30, with `p1` being less than or equal to `p2`, and `p2` being less than or equal to `p3`. The stdin is now empty, as the input has been consumed by the `input().split()` function.
