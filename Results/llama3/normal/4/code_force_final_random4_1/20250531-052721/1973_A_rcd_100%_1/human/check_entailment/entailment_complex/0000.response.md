Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly handles the cases where the sum of the scores is odd, where the highest score is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores, and where the highest score is less than the sum of the other two scores.

In the first case, where the sum of the scores is odd, the program correctly prints -1, as it is impossible to achieve an odd sum with the given scoring system.

In the second case, where the highest score is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores, the program correctly prints the sum of the two lower scores. This is because the highest score can be achieved by having the player with the highest score win all their games against the other two players, resulting in a score equal to the sum of the other two scores.

In the third case, where the highest score is less than the sum of the other two scores, the program correctly calculates and prints the maximum possible score by iteratively adjusting the scores. This is done by incrementing the score of the player with the lowest score and decrementing the score of the player with the highest score, until the score of the player with the lowest score is greater than or equal to the score of the player with the highest score. This process ensures that the scores are non-decreasing and that the sum of the scores is even.

Overall, the program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the maximum possible score that can be achieved by rearranging the scores, considering the constraints of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
