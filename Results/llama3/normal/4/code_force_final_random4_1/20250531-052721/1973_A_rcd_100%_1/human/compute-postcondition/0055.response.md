Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers between 0 and 30, `p1` is less than or equal to `p2`, `p2` is less than or equal to `p3`, `p3` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is 1, `y` is greater than or equal to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The printed value `p1 - x + p3` is still equal to `p1 - 1 + p3`.
