The code prints the result of the expression `p1 - x + p3`. Based on the precondition, we know that `p1` is an integer between 0 and 30, `x` is 1, and `p3` is an integer between 0 and 30 and is greater than or equal to `p2`, which is greater than or equal to `p1`.

Since `x` is 1, the expression `p1 - x` will result in `p1 - 1`. Adding `p3` to this result will give us a value between `p1 - 1` and `p1 + p3`.

Therefore, the postcondition is:

Output: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `p1` is an integer between 0 and 30, `p2` is an integer between 0 and 30 and `p2` is greater than or equal to `p1`, `p3` is an integer between 0 and 30 and `p3` is greater than or equal to `p2`, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, `x` is 1, `y` is greater than or equal to 1, and the result of the expression `p1 - x + p3` is being printed, which is a value between `p1 - 1` and `p1 + p3`.**
