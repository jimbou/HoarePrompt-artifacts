Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers between 0 and 30, `p1` is less than or equal to `p2`, `p2` is less than or equal to `p3`, `p3` must be greater than 1, `x` is equal to `y`, `y` is equal to `p3 - 1` or `p3 - 2` or `p3 - 3` or ... or `0`.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers between 0 and 30, `p1` is less than or equal to `p2`, `p2` is less than or equal to `p3`, `p3` must be greater than 1, `x` is equal to `y`, and `y` is equal to `p3 - 1` or `p3 - 2` or `p3 - 3` or ... or `0`. This means that the loop will continue to execute until `y` is less than `x`, at which point the loop will exit and the final values of `x` and `y` will be equal.
