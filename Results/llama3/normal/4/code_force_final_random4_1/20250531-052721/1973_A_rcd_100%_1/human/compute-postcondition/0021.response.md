The variables in the loop head are `x` and `y`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x` and `y`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 1, `y` is `p3 - 1`. `y` being `p3 - 1` does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `y` is greater than or equal to 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `p1` is an integer between 0 and 30, `p2` is an integer between 0 and 30 and `p2` is greater than or equal to `p1`, `p3` is an integer between 0 and 30 and `p3` is greater than or equal to `p2`, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, `x` is 1, `y` is greater than or equal to 1**
