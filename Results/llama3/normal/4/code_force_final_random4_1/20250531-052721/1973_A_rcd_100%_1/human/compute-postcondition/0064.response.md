Output State: **t is at least 2, _ is 1, p1, p2, p3 are integers between 0 and 30, p1 is less than or equal to p2, p2 is less than or equal to p3, p3 is greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains no input. If p1 - x is less than or equal to p2 - y, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, x is equal to y.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variables t, _, p1, p2, and p3 remain unchanged, and the loop will either break out of the if statement when p1 - x is less than or equal to p2 - y, or x will be equal to y when the loop finishes executing.
