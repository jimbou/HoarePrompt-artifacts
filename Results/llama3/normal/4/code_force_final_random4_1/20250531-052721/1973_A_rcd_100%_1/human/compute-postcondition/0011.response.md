Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `p1` is an integer between 0 and 30, `p2` is an integer between 0 and 30 and `p2` is greater than or equal to `p1`, `p3` is an integer between 0 and 30 and `p3` is greater than or equal to `p2`. If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is an odd number, the program skips to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues with the next statement. Additionally, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`.***
