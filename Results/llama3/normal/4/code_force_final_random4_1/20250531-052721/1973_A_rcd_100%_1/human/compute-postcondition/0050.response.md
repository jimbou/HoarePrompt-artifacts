Output State: **t is at least 2, _ is 1, p1, p2, p3 are integers between 0 and 30, p1 is less than or equal to p2, p2 is less than or equal to p3, x is 1, y is equal to p3 - 1 and p3 must be greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains no input. Additionally, p1 - x is greater than p2 - y**

In this output state, the values of `x` and `y` have been updated according to the code. `x` has been incremented by 1, making it 1, and `y` has been decremented by 1, making it `p3 - 1`. The relationship between `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remains the same, as well as the value of `_` and the lower bound of `t`. The condition `p1 - x is greater than p2 - y` still holds true.
