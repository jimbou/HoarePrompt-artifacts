Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three integers p_1, p_2 and p_3 (0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30) â€” the scores of the three players, sorted non-decreasingly.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())
    if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
        print(-1)
        continue
    if p3 >= p1 + p2:
        print(p1 + p2)
    else:
        x = 0
        y = p3
        while y >= x:
            if p1 - x <= p2 - y:
                print(p1 - x + p3)
                break
            else:
                x += 1
                y -= 1
        else:
            print(p3)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `p1` is an integer between 0 and 30, `p2` is an integer between 0 and 30 and `p2` is greater than or equal to `p1`, `p3` is an integer between 0 and 30 and `p3` is greater than or equal to `p2`. If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is an even number and `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, then the sum of `p1` and `p2` is printed. If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is an odd number, the program skips to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `x` is set to `p3` and `y` is set to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers between 0 and 30, `p1` is less than or equal to `p2`, `p2` is less than or equal to `p3`, stdin contains no input. If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, -1 is printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1` + `p2`, the sum of `p1` and `p2` is printed. If `p3` is less than `p1` + `p2`, then if `p1` - `x` is less than or equal to `p2` - `y`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `x` is equal to `y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers between 0 and 30, `p1` is less than or equal to `p2`, `p2` is less than or equal to `p3`, stdin contains no input. If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, then -1 is printed. If `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1` + `p2`, the sum of `p1` and `p2` is printed. Otherwise, `p3` must be greater than 1, and `x` is equal to `y`, which is equal to `p3 - 1` or `p3 - 2` or `p3 - 3` or ... or `0`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
