Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `num` is the first integer in the list, `k` is an integer, 2 <= k <= 100, the length of `arr` is n, where 1 <= n <= 100, and `frequency_table` is a dictionary with `num` as a key and its value is `k`.**

In this output state, the value of `frequency_table[num]` has been updated to `k`, which is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive). The other variables, such as `arr`, `num`, and `k`, remain unchanged. The length of `arr` is still `n`, where `n` is between 1 and 100 (inclusive). The dictionary `frequency_table` still has `num` as a key, but its value is now `k`, which is a specific integer value.
