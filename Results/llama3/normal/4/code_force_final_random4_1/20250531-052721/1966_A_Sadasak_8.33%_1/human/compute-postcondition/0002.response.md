The code updates the `frequency_table` dictionary by incrementing the count of the first integer `num` in the list `arr`. The `get` method is used to retrieve the current count of `num` in the dictionary, defaulting to 0 if it's not present. The count is then incremented by 1.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `num` is the first integer in the list, `k` is an integer, 2 <= k <= 100, the length of `arr` is n, where 1 <= n <= 100, and `frequency_table` is a dictionary with `num` as a key and its value is 1 more than its previous count (which was 0 since it was an empty dictionary)**
