To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `num` and `arr`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr`. If `arr` has at least 1 integer, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `arr` is a list of integers, `k` is an integer, and `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary. So for the loop to be executed, `arr` must have at least 1 integer and `num` is the first integer in the list.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `num` is the first integer in the list, `k` is an integer, 2 <= k <= 100, the length of `arr` is n, where 1 <= n <= 100, and `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary**
