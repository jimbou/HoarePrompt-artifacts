Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `num` is the third integer in the list, `k` is an integer, 2 <= k <= 100, the length of `arr` is n, where 3 <= n <= 100, and `frequency_table` is a dictionary with `num` as a key. If the value of `num` in `frequency_table` is greater than `k`, then the value of `num` in `frequency_table` is set to `k`. Otherwise, the value of `num` in `frequency_table` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `arr` still contains at least 3 integers, and `num` is still the third integer in the list. The value of `k` remains an integer between 2 and 100, and the length of `arr` is still between 3 and 100. The `frequency_table` dictionary still has `num` as a key, but its value has been updated. If the original value of `num` in `frequency_table` was greater than `k`, it has been set to `k`. Otherwise, its value has been incremented by 1.
