Output State: **arr is a list of integers, k is an integer, 2 <= k <= 100, the length of arr is n, where 1 <= n <= 100, and frequency_table is an empty dictionary.**

In this output state, the values of arr, k, and n remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. The code only introduced a new variable, frequency_table, which is an empty dictionary. The length of arr, n, is still between 1 and 100, and k is still between 2 and 100.
