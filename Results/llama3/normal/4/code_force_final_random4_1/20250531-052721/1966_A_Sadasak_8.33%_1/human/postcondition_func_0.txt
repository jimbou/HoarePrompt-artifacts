This function generates a frequency table from a given list of integers, where the frequency of each integer is capped at a specified value k. It takes a list of integers and an integer k as input, and returns a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list and its corresponding value is the frequency of that integer, limited to k. The function ensures that all integers from the input list are included in the frequency table, with their frequencies accurately counted and capped at k.
