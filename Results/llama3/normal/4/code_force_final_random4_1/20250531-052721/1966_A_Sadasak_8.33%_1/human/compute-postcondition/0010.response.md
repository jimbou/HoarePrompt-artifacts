The only variable in the loop head is variable  num and list arr, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list arr.  If the list has at least 3 integers the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, arr has at least 2 integers, num is the second integer in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 integers and the num is the third integer in the list.
State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `num` is the third integer in the list, `k` is an integer, 2 <= k <= 100, the length of `arr` is n, where 3 <= n <= 100, and `frequency_table` is a dictionary with `num` as a key. If the value of `num` in `frequency_table` is greater than `k`, then the value of `num` in `frequency_table` is set to `k`. Otherwise, the value of `num` in `frequency_table` is incremented by 1.**
