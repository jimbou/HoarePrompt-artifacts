Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `num` is the last integer in the list, `k` is an integer, 2 <= k <= 100, the length of `arr` is n, where 1 <= n <= 100, and `frequency_table` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `arr` and each value is the frequency of that integer in `arr`, capped at `k`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the `frequency_table` dictionary will contain the frequency of each integer in the `arr` list, but with a maximum frequency of `k`. The `num` variable will be the last integer in the `arr` list, and the `k` variable will remain unchanged. The length of the `arr` list will also remain unchanged.
