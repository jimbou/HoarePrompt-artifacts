Output State: **The program returns a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `arr` and each value is the frequency of that integer in `arr`, capped at `k`. The dictionary contains all integers from `arr` as keys, and their corresponding frequencies as values, but no frequency exceeds `k`. The length of `arr` is between 1 and 100, and `k` is an integer between 2 and 100.**
