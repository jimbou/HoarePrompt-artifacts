#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, k is an integer, 2 <= k <= 100, and the length of arr is n, where 1 <= n <= 100.
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in arr:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
        
        if frequency_table[num] > k:
            frequency_table[num] = k
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers, `num` is the last integer in the list, `k` is an integer, 2 <= k <= 100, the length of `arr` is n, where 1 <= n <= 100, and `frequency_table` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `arr` and each value is the frequency of that integer in `arr`, capped at `k`.
    return frequency_table
    #The program returns a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `arr` and each value is the frequency of that integer in `arr`, capped at `k`. The dictionary contains all integers from `arr` as keys, and their corresponding frequencies as values, but no frequency exceeds `k`. The length of `arr` is between 1 and 100, and `k` is an integer between 2 and 100.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function generates a frequency table from a given list of integers, where the frequency of each integer is capped at a specified value k. It takes a list of integers and an integer k as input, and returns a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list and its corresponding value is the frequency of that integer, limited to k. The function ensures that all integers from the input list are included in the frequency table, with their frequencies accurately counted and capped at k.
