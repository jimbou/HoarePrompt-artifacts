Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `num` is the second integer in the list, `k` is an integer, 2 <= k <= 100, the length of `arr` is n, where 2 <= n <= 100, and `frequency_table` is a dictionary with `num` as a key. If the value of `num` in `frequency_table` is greater than `k`, then the value of `num` in `frequency_table` is set to `k`. Otherwise, the value of `num` in `frequency_table` is incremented by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `num` in `frequency_table` is either incremented by 1 or set to `k`, depending on its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged.
