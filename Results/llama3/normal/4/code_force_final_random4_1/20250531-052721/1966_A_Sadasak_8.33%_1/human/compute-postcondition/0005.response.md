Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `num` is the first integer in the list, `k` is an integer, 2 <= k <= 100, the length of `arr` is n, where 1 <= n <= 100, and `frequency_table` is a dictionary with `num` as a key. If the value of `num` in `frequency_table` is greater than `k`, then the value of `num` in `frequency_table` is set to `k`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `frequency_table`.***
