Output State: **n is an integer such that n is greater than or equal to 0, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for all i, b is a list of n integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for all i, c is a list of n integers such that 1 <= c_i <= 10^9 for all i, suff is a list of n+1 integers where suff[i] = sum(c[j] for j in range(i, n)) for all i, i is -1.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the state of the variables is as follows: n and k remain unchanged, a and b remain unchanged, c remains unchanged, suff is now a list where each element at index i is the sum of all elements in c from index i to the end of the list, and i is -1, indicating that the loop has finished executing.
