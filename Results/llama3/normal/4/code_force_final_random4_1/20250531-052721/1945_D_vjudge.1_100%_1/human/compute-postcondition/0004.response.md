Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `n` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for all i, `b` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for all i, `c` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= c_i <= 10^9 for all i, `suff` is a list of `n+1` integers where suff[n-1] = c[n-1], suff[n] = 0, suff[n-2] = c[n-2] + c[n-1] and the rest of the elements are zeros, `i` is `n-2`.**

In this output state, the value of `suff[i]` has been updated to `suff[i + 1] + c[i]`, where `i` is `n-2`. This means that `suff[n-2]` now holds the value of `c[n-2] + c[n-1]`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
