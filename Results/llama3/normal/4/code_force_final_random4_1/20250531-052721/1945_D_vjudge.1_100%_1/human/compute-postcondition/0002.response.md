Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `n` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for all i, `b` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for all i, `c` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= c_i <= 10^9 for all i, `suff` is a list of `n+1` integers where suff[n-1] = c[n-1] and suff[n] = 0 and the rest of the elements are zeros, `i` is `n-1`.**

In this output state, the value of `suff[i]` is updated to be the sum of `c[i]` and `suff[i + 1]`, where `i` is `n-1`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The list `suff` now has a value at index `n-1` which is equal to `c[n-1]`, and the value at index `n` is still 0. The rest of the elements in the list `suff` are still zeros.
