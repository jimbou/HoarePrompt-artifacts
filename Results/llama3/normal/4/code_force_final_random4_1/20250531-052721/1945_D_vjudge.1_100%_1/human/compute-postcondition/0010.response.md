Output State: **`n` is an integer such that n is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for all i, `b` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for all i, `c` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= c_i <= 10^9 for all i, `suff` is a list of n+1 integers where suff[i] = sum(c[j] for j in range(i, n)) for all i, `i` is 0, `ans` is either positive infinity or a[i] + suff[i + 1] if a[i] + suff[i + 1] is less than positive infinity.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state except for the value of `ans`. The value of `ans` is now either still positive infinity or the minimum of its previous value and the sum of `a[i]` and `suff[i + 1]`, where `i` is 0. This means that `ans` has been updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the sum of the first element of `a` and the sum of all elements of `c` starting from the second element.
