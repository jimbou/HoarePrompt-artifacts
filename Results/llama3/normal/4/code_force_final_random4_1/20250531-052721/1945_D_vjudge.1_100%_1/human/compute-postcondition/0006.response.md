Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `n` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for all i, `b` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for all i, `c` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= c_i <= 10^9 for all i, `suff` is a list of `n+1` integers where suff[n-1] = c[n-1], suff[n] = 0, suff[n-2] = c[n-2] + c[n-1], suff[n-3] = c[n-3] + c[n-2] + c[n-1], and the rest of the elements are zeros, `i` is `n-3`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `c` remains the same. The value of `suff` is updated such that `suff[n-3]` is now equal to `c[n-3] + c[n-2] + c[n-1]`. The value of `i` remains the same.
