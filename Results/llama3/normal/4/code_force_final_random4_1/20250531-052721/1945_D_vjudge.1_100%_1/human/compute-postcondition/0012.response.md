Output State: **`n` is an integer such that n is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= n, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for all i, `b` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for all i, `c` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= c_i <= 10^9 for all i, `suff` is a list of n+1 integers where suff[i] = sum(c[j] for j in range(i, n)) for all i, `i` is 1, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and a[1] + suff[2]**.

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their previous values except for `ans`. The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the sum of the first element of list `a` and the second element of list `suff`.
