State: **`n` is an integer such that `n` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for all i, `b` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for all i, `c` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= c_i <= 10^9 for all i, `suff` is a list of `n+1` zeros, `i` is `n-1`**
