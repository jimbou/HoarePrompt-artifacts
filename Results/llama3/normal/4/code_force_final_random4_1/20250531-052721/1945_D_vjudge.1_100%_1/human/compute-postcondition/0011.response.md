The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `k` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer such that n is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= n, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for all i, `b` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for all i, `c` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= c_i <= 10^9 for all i, `suff` is a list of n+1 integers where suff[i] = sum(c[j] for j in range(i, n)) for all i, `i` is 1, `ans` is either positive infinity or a[i] + suff[i + 1] if a[i] + suff[i + 1] is less than positive infinity**
