The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n-1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be decreased by 1, so `i` is `n-2`. 
State: **`n` is an integer such that `n` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for all i, `b` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for all i, `c` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= c_i <= 10^9 for all i, `suff` is a list of `n+1` integers where suff[n-1] = c[n-1] and suff[n] = 0 and the rest of the elements are zeros, `i` is `n-2`.**
