To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the state of the variable `i` since it is the only variable in the loop head.

According to the code, the loop iterates from `n-1` to `-1` with a step of `-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n-2`. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be decremented by 1.

State: **`n` is an integer such that `n` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for all i, `b` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for all i, `c` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= c_i <= 10^9 for all i, `suff` is a list of `n+1` integers where suff[n-1] = c[n-1], suff[n] = 0, suff[n-2] = c[n-2] + c[n-1] and the rest of the elements are zeros, `i` is `n-3`.**
