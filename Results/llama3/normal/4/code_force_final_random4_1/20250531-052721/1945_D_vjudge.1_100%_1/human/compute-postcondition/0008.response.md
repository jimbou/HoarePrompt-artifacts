Output State: **`n` is an integer such that n is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for all i, `b` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for all i, `c` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= c_i <= 10^9 for all i, `suff` is a list of n+1 integers where suff[i] = sum(c[j] for j in range(i, n)) for all i, `i` is -1, `ans` is positive infinity.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `suff`, and `i` remain unchanged from the initial state. The only change is the introduction of a new variable `ans`, which is assigned the value of positive infinity.
