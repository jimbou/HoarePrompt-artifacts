Postcondition: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in `t`, `cnt` is the number of indices `j` such that `s[j]` is not equal to `t[j]`, stdin contains at least one test case minus the three inputs that have been read. If the number of '1' characters in `s` is equal to the number of '1' characters in `t`, then the value of `s1` is printed if `cnt` is not equal to 0, otherwise 0 is printed. If the number of '1' characters in `s` is not equal to the number of '1' characters in `t`, then the total number of indices where `s` and `t` differ, including both the indices where they have different '1' characters and the indices where they have the same '1' characters is printed.**
