Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in `t`, `cnt` is 0 if `s[0]` is equal to `t[0]`, `cnt` is 1 if `s[0]` is not equal to `t[0]`, stdin contains at least one test case minus the three inputs that have been read.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been updated based on whether the first characters of strings `s` and `t` are equal or not. If they are equal, `cnt` remains 0; if they are not equal, `cnt` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
