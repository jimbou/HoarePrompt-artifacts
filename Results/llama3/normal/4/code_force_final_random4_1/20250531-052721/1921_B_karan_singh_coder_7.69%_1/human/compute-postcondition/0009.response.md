Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in `t`, `cnt` is the number of indices `j` such that `s[j]` is not equal to `t[j]`, stdin contains at least one test case minus the three inputs that have been read. The current value of `s1` is equal to the current value of `t1`.***
