Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in `t`, `cnt` is an integer between 0 and `n`, `i` is equal to `n`, stdin contains at least one test case minus the four inputs that have been read, _ is 1**

This output state indicates that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `n` remains unchanged, `s` and `t` are still strings, `s1` and `t1` still represent the number of '1' characters in `s` and `t` respectively, `cnt` has been incremented by the number of mismatches between `s` and `t` and is now between 0 and `n`, `i` has reached the value of `n`, and the other variables remain unchanged.
