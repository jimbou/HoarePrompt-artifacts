The code prints the value of `s1` if `cnt` is not equal to 0, otherwise it prints 0. Where `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, `cnt` is the number of indices `j` such that `s[j]` is not equal to `t[j]`, and `s` and `t` are strings. Also, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in `t`, and stdin contains at least one test case minus the three inputs that have been read. The current value of `s1` is equal to the current value of `t1`.
Output: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in `t`, `cnt` is the number of indices `j` such that `s[j]` is not equal to `t[j]`, stdin contains at least one test case minus the three inputs that have been read. The current value of `s1` is equal to the current value of `t1`, and this is printed: s1 if cnt is not equal to 0, otherwise 0**
