Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: first an integer, then two strings of the same length as the integer. The strings consist of '1's and '0's. The sum of the lengths of the strings over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    t = input()
    s1 = s.count('1')
    t1 = t.count('1')
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(n):
        cnt += s[i] != t[i]
    if s1 == t1:
        print(s1 if cnt else 0)
    else:
        d = abs(s1 - t1)
        print((cnt - d) // 2 + d)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in `t`, `cnt` is the number of indices `j` such that `s[j]` is not equal to `t[j]`, stdin contains at least one test case minus the three inputs that have been read. If the number of '1' characters in `s` is equal to the number of '1' characters in `t`, then the value of `s1` is printed if `cnt` is not equal to 0, otherwise 0 is printed. If the number of '1' characters in `s` is not equal to the number of '1' characters in `t`, then the total number of indices where `s` and `t` differ, including both the indices where they have different '1' characters and the indices where they have the same '1' characters is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in `t`, `cnt` is an integer between 0 and `n`, `i` is equal to `n`, stdin contains at least one test case minus the four inputs that have been read, _ is 1. If the number of '1' characters in `s` is equal to the number of '1' characters in `t`, then either the number of '1' characters in `s` or 0 is being printed. If the number of '1' characters in `s` is not equal to the number of '1' characters in `t`, then the result of the expression `(cnt - d) // 2 + d` is printed, where `d` is the absolute difference between the number of '1' characters in `s` and `t`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in `t`, `cnt` is an integer between 0 and `n` (inclusive), `i` is equal to `n`, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus the four inputs that have been read, `_` is 2. If `s1` is equal to `t1`, the number of '1' characters in `s` is printed if `cnt` is not zero, otherwise 0 is printed. If `s1` is not equal to `t1`, the value of the expression `(cnt - d) // 2 + d` is printed, where `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`, which is equal to the value of `cnt` plus half of the absolute difference between the counts of '1' characters in strings `s` and `t`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
