Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to make the two strings identical. The program first counts the number of '1's in the initial and desired positions, and then counts the number of positions where the two strings differ. If the number of '1's in the initial and desired positions is the same, the program prints the number of differing positions if there are any, or 0 if there are no differing positions. If the number of '1's in the initial and desired positions is different, the program calculates the difference and adds it to the number of differing positions, then prints the result.

Correctness: **True**
