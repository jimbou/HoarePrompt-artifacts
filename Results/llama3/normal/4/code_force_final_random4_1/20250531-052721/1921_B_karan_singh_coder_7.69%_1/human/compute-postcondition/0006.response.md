State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in `t`, `cnt` is 0 if `s[0]` is equal to `t[0]` and `s[1]` is equal to `t[1]`, `cnt` is 1 if `s[0]` is not equal to `t[0]` and `s[1]` is equal to `t[1]`, `cnt` is 1 if `s[0]` is equal to `t[0]` and `s[1]` is not equal to `t[1]`, `cnt` is 2 if `s[0]` is not equal to `t[0]` and `s[1]` is not equal to `t[1]`, stdin contains at least one test case minus the three inputs that have been read.**
