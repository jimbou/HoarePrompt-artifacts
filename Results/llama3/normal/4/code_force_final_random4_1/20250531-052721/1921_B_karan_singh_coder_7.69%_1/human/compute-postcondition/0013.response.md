Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in `t`, `cnt` is the number of indices `j` such that `s[j]` is not equal to `t[j]`, `d` is the absolute difference between the number of '1' characters in `s` and `t`, stdin contains at least one test case minus the three inputs that have been read. The number of '1' characters in `s` is not equal to the number of '1' characters in `t`.**

In this output state, the variable `d` has been introduced and assigned the absolute difference between the number of '1' characters in strings `s` and `t`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `n`, `i`, `s`, `t`, `s1`, `t1`, and `cnt` are still valid. The stdin still contains at least one test case minus the three inputs that have been read. The number of '1' characters in `s` is still not equal to the number of '1' characters in `t`.
