Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in `t`, `cnt` is an integer between 0 and `n` (inclusive), `i` is equal to `n`, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus the four inputs that have been read, `_` is 2. If `s1` is equal to `t1`, the number of '1' characters in `s` is printed if `cnt` is not zero, otherwise 0 is printed. If `s1` is not equal to `t1`, the value of the expression `(cnt - d) // 2 + d` is printed, where `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`, which is equal to the value of `cnt` plus half of the absolute difference between the counts of '1' characters in strings `s` and `t`.***
