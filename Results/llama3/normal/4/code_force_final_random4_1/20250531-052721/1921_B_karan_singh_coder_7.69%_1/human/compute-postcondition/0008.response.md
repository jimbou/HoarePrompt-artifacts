Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in `t`, `cnt` is the number of indices `j` such that `s[j]` is not equal to `t[j]`, stdin contains at least one test case minus the three inputs that have been read.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, which is the number of iterations the loop was supposed to execute. The variable `cnt` will hold the total number of indices `j` where `s[j]` is not equal to `t[j]`, which is the purpose of the loop. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
