Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in `t`, `cnt` is an integer between 0 and `n` (inclusive), `i` is equal to `n`, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus the four inputs that have been read, `_` is 2**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that `n` remains an integer greater than or equal to 0, `s` and `t` remain strings, `s1` and `t1` remain the counts of '1' characters in `s` and `t` respectively, `cnt` becomes an integer between 0 and `n` (inclusive) representing the total number of mismatches between `s` and `t` up to the `n`-th position, `i` is reset to its initial value `n`, and the other variables (`stdin` and `_`) remain unchanged.
