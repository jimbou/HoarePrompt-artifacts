Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in `t`, `cnt` is an integer between 0 and `n`, `i` is equal to `n`, `d` is the absolute difference between the number of '1' characters in `s` and `t`, stdin contains at least one test case minus the four inputs that have been read, _ is 1. The number of '1' characters in `s` is not equal to the number of '1' characters in `t`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The variables `n`, `s`, `t`, `s1`, `t1`, `cnt`, `i`, and `_` retain their initial values and properties. A new variable `d` is introduced, which is the absolute difference between the number of '1' characters in strings `s` and `t`. The stdin still contains at least one test case minus the four inputs that have been read. The number of '1' characters in `s` is still not equal to the number of '1' characters in `t`.
