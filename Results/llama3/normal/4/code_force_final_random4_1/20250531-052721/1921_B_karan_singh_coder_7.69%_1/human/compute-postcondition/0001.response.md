Output State: **n is an integer, s is a string, t is a string, s1 is the number of '1' characters in s, t1 is the number of '1' characters in t, cnt is 0, stdin contains at least one test case minus the three inputs that have been read.**

In this output state, the value of `n` is an integer that was read from stdin. The values of `s` and `t` are strings that were also read from stdin. The value of `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, and the value of `t1` is the number of '1' characters in `t`. The value of `cnt` is 0, as it was initialized to 0 and not modified by the code. Stdin now contains at least one test case minus the three inputs that have been read.
