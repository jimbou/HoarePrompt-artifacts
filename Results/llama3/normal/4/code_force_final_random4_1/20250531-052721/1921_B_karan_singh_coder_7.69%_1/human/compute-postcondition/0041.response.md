Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in `t`, `cnt` is either 0, 1, 2 or 3, `i` is 2, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus the four inputs that have been read, `_` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been updated to either 0, 1, 2 or 3, depending on whether the characters at index `i` in strings `s` and `t` are equal or not. The other variables remain unchanged.
