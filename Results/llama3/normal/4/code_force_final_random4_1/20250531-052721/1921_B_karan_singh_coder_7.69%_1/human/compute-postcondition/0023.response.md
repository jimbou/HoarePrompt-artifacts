To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer greater than 1.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `i` is now 2, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in `t`, `cnt` is either 0, 1, or 2, `i` is 2, stdin contains at least one test case minus the four inputs that have been read, _ is 1**
