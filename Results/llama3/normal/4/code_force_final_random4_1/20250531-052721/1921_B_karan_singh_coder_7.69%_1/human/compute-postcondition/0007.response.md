Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in `t`, `cnt` is 0 if `s[0]` is equal to `t[0]`, `s[1]` is equal to `t[1]`, and `s[2]` is equal to `t[2]`, `cnt` is 1 if `s[0]` is not equal to `t[0]` or `s[1]` is not equal to `t[1]` or `s[2]` is not equal to `t[2]`, stdin contains at least one test case minus the three inputs that have been read.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been updated based on the comparison of the characters at index `i` (which is 2) in strings `s` and `t`. If the characters at index 2 are equal, `cnt` remains the same, otherwise, it is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
