Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in `t`, `cnt` is an integer between 0 and `n`, `i` is equal to `n`, stdin contains at least one test case minus the four inputs that have been read, _ is 1. If the number of '1' characters in `s` is equal to the number of '1' characters in `t`, then either the number of '1' characters in `s` or 0 is being printed. If the number of '1' characters in `s` is not equal to the number of '1' characters in `t`, then the result of the expression `(cnt - d) // 2 + d` is printed, where `d` is the absolute difference between the number of '1' characters in `s` and `t`.***
