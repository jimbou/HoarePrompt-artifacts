Output State: **All test cases have been processed.**

In natural language, this means that the loop has executed for all test cases provided in the input, and the output for each test case has been printed according to the conditions specified in the loop body. The loop has iterated over all the test cases, and the final output state reflects that all test cases have been processed and their outputs have been generated.
