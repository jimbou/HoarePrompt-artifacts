The code `cnt += s[i] != t[i]` increments the value of `cnt` by 1 if the characters at index `i` in strings `s` and `t` are different, and does not change `cnt` if they are the same.

Since `i` is 1, we are comparing the second characters of `s` and `t`. The value of `cnt` is either 0 or 1, so after the increment, `cnt` will be either 0, 1, or 2.

The other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in `t`, `cnt` is either 0, 1, or 2, `i` is 1, stdin contains at least one test case minus the four inputs that have been read, _ is 1**
