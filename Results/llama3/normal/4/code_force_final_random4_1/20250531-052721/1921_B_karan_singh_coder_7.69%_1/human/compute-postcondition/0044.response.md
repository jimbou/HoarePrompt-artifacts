The code prints the value of `s1` if `cnt` is not zero, otherwise it prints 0. Since `cnt` is an integer between 0 and `n` (inclusive), and `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `cnt` can be either 0 or a positive integer. 

Since the current value of `s1` is equal to the current value of `t1`, `s1` is equal to the number of '1' characters in `t`. 

However, the exact value of `cnt` is not provided, so we can't determine whether `s1` or 0 will be printed. 

Output: **s1 (which is the number of '1' characters in t) if cnt is not zero, otherwise 0**
