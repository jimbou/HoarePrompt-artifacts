Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in `t`, `cnt` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus the four inputs that have been read, `_` is 2**

The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1 if the characters at the current index `i` in strings `s` and `t` are different, otherwise it remains the same. Since `i` is 0, we are comparing the first characters of `s` and `t`. If they are the same, `cnt` remains 0, otherwise it becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
