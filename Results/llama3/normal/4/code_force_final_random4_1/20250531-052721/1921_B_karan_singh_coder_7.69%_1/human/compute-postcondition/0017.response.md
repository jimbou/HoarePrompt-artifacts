The only variable in the loop head is the variable `_` and the range of the loop, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range of the loop. If the range of the loop is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the range of the loop is greater than or equal to 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time the range of the loop must be greater than 0 and `_` is 1.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in `t`, `cnt` is the number of indices `j` such that `s[j]` is not equal to `t[j]`, stdin contains at least one test case minus the three inputs that have been read, `_` is 1, the range of the loop is greater than 0**
