Output State: **n is an integer equal to data[index-n], q is an integer equal to data[index-n+1], index is n+2q+n+3+2q+2n, a is a list of n+1 integers where a[i] is data[index-n+i-1] for i in range(1, n+1), pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[i] is pf[i-1] ^ a[i] for i in range(1, n+1), mp is a dictionary with key-value pairs: 0 maps to a list containing 0, pf[i] maps to a list containing i for i in range(1, n+1), stdin contains t-n-2q-n-2q-4-n test cases, t is at least 3, results is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' with q additional 'YES' or 'NO' appended, i is n, l is an integer equal to data[index-2q-1], r is an integer equal to data[index-2q], x is an integer equal to pf[r] ^ pf[l-1], v1 is a list containing r, v2 is a list containing l-1, it1 is an integer equal to the insertion point of l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is an integer equal to the insertion point of r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus one, n must be greater than or equal to 0.**

This output state represents the final state of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations. The loop iterates from 1 to n, and in each iteration, it updates the values of a, pf, and mp based on the current index and data values. The other variables remain unchanged throughout the loop.
