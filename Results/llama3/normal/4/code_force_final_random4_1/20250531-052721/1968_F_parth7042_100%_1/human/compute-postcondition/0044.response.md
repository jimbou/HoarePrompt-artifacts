Output State: **t is at least 2, index is n+2q+5, results is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO', n is greater than 1, q is an integer, a is a list of n+1 integers where a[1] is an integer and a[2] is an integer, pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[1] is an integer and pf[2] is an integer equal to pf[1] ^ a[2], mp is a dictionary with key-value pairs: 0 maps to a list containing 0, pf[1] maps to a list containing 1, pf[2] maps to a list containing 2, i is 2, and stdin contains t-n-2q-4 test cases**

In this final state, the value of `index` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `a[2]` has been set to an integer from the input data. The value of `pf[2]` has been calculated as the bitwise XOR of `pf[1]` and `a[2]`. The dictionary `mp` has been updated to include a new key-value pair, where the key is `pf[2]` and the value is a list containing the index `2`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the number of test cases in `stdin` has been reduced by 1.
