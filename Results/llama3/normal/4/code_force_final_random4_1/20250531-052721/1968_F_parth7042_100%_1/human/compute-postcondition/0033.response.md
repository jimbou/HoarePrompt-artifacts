Postcondition: ***t is at least 1, index is n+9, results is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO', it1 is less than the length of v1, it2 is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer, q is greater than 1, a is a list of n+1 integers, pf is a list of n+1 integers, mp is a dictionary with key-value pairs, i is n, l is the integer value of data[n+7], r is the integer value of data[n+8], x is pf[r] XOR pf[l-1], v1 is a list containing indices of pf[r], v2 is a list containing indices of pf[l-1], it1 is the insertion point of l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is the insertion point of r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus 1, and stdin contains t-n-7 test cases. If x is 0, an additional 'YES' is appended to results and stdin contains t-n-8 test cases.***
