Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is at least 2, index is n+2q+3, results is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO', n is an integer, q is an integer, a is a list of n+1 zeros, pf is a list of n+1 zeros, mp is a dictionary with key-value pairs: 0 maps to a list containing 0, i is n, and stdin contains t-n-2q-2 test cases.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    a[i] = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
    mp[pf[i]].append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is at least 2, index is n+2q+4, results is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO', n is at least 1, q is an integer, a is a list of n+1 integers where a[1] is an integer, pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[1] is an integer, mp is a dictionary with key-value pairs: 0 maps to a list containing 0, pf[1] maps to a list containing 1, i is 1, and stdin contains t-n-2q-3 test cases

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is at least 2, index is n+2q+5, results is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO', n is greater than 1, q is an integer, a is a list of n+1 integers where a[1] is an integer and a[2] is an integer, pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[1] is an integer and pf[2] is an integer equal to pf[1] ^ a[2], mp is a dictionary with key-value pairs: 0 maps to a list containing 0, pf[1] maps to a list containing 1, pf[2] maps to a list containing 2, i is 2, and stdin contains t-n-2q-4 test cases

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is at least 2, index is n+2q+6, results is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO', n is greater than 2, q is an integer, a is a list of n+1 integers where a[1] is an integer and a[2] is an integer and a[3] is an integer equal to data[n+2q+5], pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[1] is an integer and pf[2] is an integer equal to pf[1] ^ a[2] and pf[3] is an integer equal to pf[2] ^ a[3], mp is a dictionary with key-value pairs: 0 maps to a list containing 0, pf[1] maps to a list containing 1, pf[2] maps to a list containing 2, pf[3] maps to a list containing 3, i is 3, and stdin contains t-n-2q-6 test cases.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
