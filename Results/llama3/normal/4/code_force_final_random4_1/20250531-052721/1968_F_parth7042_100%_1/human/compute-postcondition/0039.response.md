The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is at least 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time `t` must be at least 2.
State: **`t` is at least 2, `index` is `n+2q+1`, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO', `n` is an integer, `q` is 0, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where `a[i]` is the integer value of `data[i+2]` for `i` in range(1, `n+1`), `pf` is a list of `n+1` integers where `pf[i]` is `pf[i-1]` XOR `a[i]` for `i` in range(1, `n+1`), `mp` is a dictionary with key-value pairs: `pf[i]` maps to a list containing `i` for `i` in range(1, `n+1`), `i` is `n`, and `stdin` contains `t-n-2q` test cases.**
