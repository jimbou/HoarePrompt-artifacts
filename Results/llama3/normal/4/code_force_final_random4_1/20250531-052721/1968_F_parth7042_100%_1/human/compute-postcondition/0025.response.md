Output State: **t is at least 1, index is n+7, results is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO'. If x is 0, results has an additional 'YES' at the end. n is an integer, q is at least 2, a is a list of n+1 integers where a[i] is the integer value of data[i+2] for i in range(1, n+1), pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[i] is pf[i-1] XOR a[i] for i in range(1, n+1), mp is a dictionary with key-value pairs: pf[i] maps to a list containing i for i in range(1, n+1), i is n, l is the integer value of data[n+5], r is the integer value of data[n+6], x is pf[r] XOR pf[l-1], v1 is a list containing indices of pf[r], v2 is a list containing indices of pf[l-1], it1 is the insertion point of l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is the insertion point of r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus 1, and stdin contains t-n-5 test cases.**

The code block modifies the values of `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, and `it2`. The first line assigns to `v1` the list of indices of `pf[r]` from the dictionary `mp`. The second line assigns to `v2` the list of indices of `pf[l-1]` from the dictionary `mp`. The third line finds the insertion point of `l` in `v1` to maintain sorted order and assigns it to `it1`. The fourth line finds the insertion point of `r` in `v2` to maintain sorted order, subtracts 1 from it, and assigns it to `it2`. No other variables are affected.
