The only variable in the loop head is variable q, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable q. If q is at least 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, q is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, q must be at least 2.
State: **t is at least 2, index is n+2q+n+5, results is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO', n is an integer, q is at least 2, a is a list of n+1 integers where a[i] is an integer for all 1 <= i <= n, pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[i] is an integer equal to pf[i-1] ^ a[i] for all 1 <= i <= n, mp is a dictionary with key-value pairs: 0 maps to a list containing 0, pf[i] maps to a list containing i for all 1 <= i <= n, i is n, l is an integer equal to data[index-2], r is an integer equal to data[index-1], x is an integer equal to pf[r] ^ pf[l-1], v1 is a list containing r, v2 is a list containing l-1, it1 is an integer equal to the insertion point of l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is an integer equal to the insertion point of r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus one, and stdin contains t-n-2q-n-4 test cases. If it1 is less than the length of v1, it2 is greater than or equal to 0, and v1[it1] is less than v2[it2], then results is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' with an additional 'YES' appended. Otherwise, results is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' with an additional 'NO' appended.**
