Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer, index is 1, results is an empty list, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and q, followed by a list of n integers, followed by q pairs of integers l and r.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    q = int(data[index + 1])
    index += 2
    a = [0] * (n + 1)
    pf = [0] * (n + 1)
    mp = defaultdict(list)
    mp[0].append(0)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        a[i] = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
        mp[pf[i]].append(i)
    for _ in range(q):
        l = int(data[index])
        r = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
        if x == 0:
            results.append('YES')
            continue
        v1 = mp[pf[r]]
        v2 = mp[pf[l - 1]]
        it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)
        it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
        if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] < v2[it2]:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is at least 1, index is n+2q+1, results is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO', n is an integer, q is 0, a is a list of n+1 integers where a[i] is the integer value of data[i+2] for i in range(1, n+1), pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[i] is pf[i-1] XOR a[i] for i in range(1, n+1), mp is a dictionary with key-value pairs: pf[i] maps to a list containing i for i in range(1, n+1), i is n, and stdin contains t-n-2q test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is at least 2, index is n+2q+n+3+2q, results is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' with q additional 'YES' or 'NO' appended, n is an integer, q is at least 0, a is a list of n+1 integers where a[i] is an integer for all 1 <= i <= n, pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[i] is an integer equal to pf[i-1] ^ a[i] for all 1 <= i <= n, mp is a dictionary with key-value pairs: 0 maps to a list containing 0, pf[i] maps to a list containing i for all 1 <= i <= n, i is n, l is an integer equal to data[index-2q-1], r is an integer equal to data[index-2q], x is an integer equal to pf[r] ^ pf[l-1], v1 is a list containing r, v2 is a list containing l-1, it1 is an integer equal to the insertion point of l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is an integer equal to the insertion point of r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus one, and stdin contains t-n-2q-n-2q-2 test cases. If it1 is less than the length of v1 and it2 is greater than or equal to 0 and v1[it1] is less than v2[it2], then the program executes the if part. Otherwise, the program executes the else part.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer equal to data[index-n], q is 0, index is n+2q+n+2q+1+2n, a is a list of n+1 integers where a[i] is data[index-n+i-1] for i in range(1, n+1), pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[i] is pf[i-1] ^ a[i] for i in range(1, n+1), mp is a dictionary with key-value pairs: 0 maps to a list containing 0, pf[i] maps to a list containing i for i in range(1, n+1), stdin contains t-n-2q-n-2q-2q-2-n test cases, t is at least 3, results is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' with q additional 'YES' or 'NO' appended and one more 'NO' appended if either it1 is greater than or equal to the length of v1, or it2 is less than 0, or (v1[it1] is greater than or equal to v2[it2]), i is n, l is an integer equal to data[index-2q-1], r is an integer equal to data[index-2q], x is an integer equal to pf[r] ^ pf[l-1], v1 is a list containing r, v2 is a list containing l-1, it1 is an integer equal to the insertion point of l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is an integer equal to the insertion point of r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus one, n must be greater than or equal to 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
