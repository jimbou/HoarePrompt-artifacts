To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `index` is 3, `results` is an empty list, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is at least 1, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n+1` zeros, `pf` is a list of `n+1` zeros, `mp` is a dictionary with a single key-value pair: 0 maps to a list containing 0, `i` is 1**
