Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer equal to data[index-n], q is an integer equal to data[index-n+1], index is n+2q+n+3+2q+2n, a is a list of n+1 integers where a[i] is data[index-n+i-1] for i in range(1, n+1), pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[i] is pf[i-1] ^ a[i] for i in range(1, n+1), mp is a dictionary with key-value pairs: 0 maps to a list containing 0, pf[i] maps to a list containing i for i in range(1, n+1), stdin contains t-n-2q-n-2q-4-n test cases, t is at least 3, results is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' with q additional 'YES' or 'NO' appended, i is n, l is an integer equal to data[index-2q-1], r is an integer equal to data[index-2q], x is an integer equal to pf[r] ^ pf[l-1], v1 is a list containing r, v2 is a list containing l-1, it1 is an integer equal to the insertion point of l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is an integer equal to the insertion point of r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus one, n must be greater than or equal to 0.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l = int(data[index])
    r = int(data[index + 1])
    index += 2
    x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
    if x == 0:
        results.append('YES')
        continue
    v1 = mp[pf[r]]
    v2 = mp[pf[l - 1]]
    it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)
    it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
    if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] < v2[it2]:
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer equal to data[index-n], q must be at least 1, index is n+2q+n+5+2q+2n, a is a list of n+1 integers where a[i] is data[index-n+i-1] for i in range(1, n+1), pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[i] is pf[i-1] ^ a[i] for i in range(1, n+1), mp is a dictionary with key-value pairs: 0 maps to a list containing 0, pf[i] maps to a list containing i for i in range(1, n+1), stdin contains t-n-2q-n-2q-6-n test cases, t is at least 3, results is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' with q+2 additional 'YES' or 'NO' appended if x is 0 and it1 is less than the length of v1, it2 is greater than or equal to 0, and v1[it1] is less than v2[it2], otherwise results is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' with q+1 additional 'YES' or 'NO' appended if x is 0, otherwise results is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' with q additional 'YES' or 'NO' appended and one more 'NO' appended if either it1 is greater than or equal to the length of v1, or it2 is less than 0, or (v1[it1] is greater than or equal to v2[it2]), i is n, l is an integer equal to data[index-2q-1], r is an integer equal to data[index-2q], x is an integer equal to pf[r] ^ pf[l-1], v1 is a list containing r, v2 is a list containing l-1, it1 is an integer equal to the insertion point of l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is an integer equal to the insertion point of r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus one, n must be greater than or equal to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer equal to data[index-n], q is at least 0, index is n+2q+n+7+2q+2n, a is a list of n+1 integers where a[i] is data[index-n+i-1] for i in range(1, n+1), pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[i] is pf[i-1] ^ a[i] for i in range(1, n+1), mp is a dictionary with key-value pairs: 0 maps to a list containing 0, pf[i] maps to a list containing i for i in range(1, n+1), stdin contains t-n-2q-n-2q-8-n test cases, t is at least 3, i is n, l is an integer equal to data[index-2q-1], r is an integer equal to data[index-2q], x is an integer equal to pf[r] ^ pf[l-1], v1 is a list containing l, v2 is a list containing l-1, it1 is an integer equal to the insertion point of l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is an integer equal to the insertion point of r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus one, n must be greater than or equal to 0. If x is 0, results is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' with q+2 additional 'YES' or 'NO' appended if it1 is less than the length of v1, it2 is greater than or equal to 0, and v1[it1] is less than v2[it2]. Otherwise, results is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' with q+1 additional 'YES' or 'NO' appended if x is 0. Otherwise, results is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' with q additional 'YES' or 'NO' appended and one more 'NO' appended if either it1 is greater than or equal to the length of v1, or it2 is less than 0, or (v1[it1] is greater than or equal to v2[it2]).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer equal to `data[index-n]`, `q` is at least 1, `index` is `n+2q+n+9+2q+2n`, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where `a[i]` is `data[index-n+i-3]` for `i` in range(1, `n+1`), `pf` is a list of `n+1` integers where `pf[i]` is `pf[i-1] ^ a[i]` for `i` in range(1, `n+1`), `mp` is a dictionary with key-value pairs: 0 maps to a list containing 0, `pf[i]` maps to a list containing `i` for `i` in range(1, `n+1`), `stdin` contains `t-n-2q-n-2q-10-n` test cases, `t` is at least 3, `i` is `n`, `l` is an integer equal to `data[index-2q-3]`, `r` is an integer equal to `data[index-2q-2]`, `x` is an integer equal to `pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`, `v1` is a list containing `l`, `v2` is a list containing `l-1`, `it1` is an integer equal to the insertion point of `l` in `v1` to maintain sorted order, `it2` is an integer equal to the insertion point of `r` in `v2` to maintain sorted order minus one. If `it1` is less than the length of `v1`, `it2` is greater than or equal to 0, and `v1[it1]` is less than `v2[it2]`, then `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' with `q+2` additional 'YES' or 'NO' appended. Otherwise, if `x` is 0, then `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' with `q+1` additional 'YES' or 'NO' appended. Otherwise, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' with `q` additional 'YES' or 'NO' appended and one more 'NO' appended if either `it1` is greater than or equal to the length of `v1`, or `it2` is less than 0, or (`v1[it1]` is greater than or equal to `v2[it2]`), and one more 'YES' appended if `it1` is less than the length of `v1`, `it2` is greater than or equal to 0, and `v1[it1]` is less than `v2[it2]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
