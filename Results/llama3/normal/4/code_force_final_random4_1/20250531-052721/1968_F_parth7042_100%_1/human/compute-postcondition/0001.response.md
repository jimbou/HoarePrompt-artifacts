To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Since `t` is a positive integer, it already satisfies this condition. However, to make it explicit that the loop will execute, we can adjust the state of `t` to be "t is at least 1".

The variable `_` is a throwaway variable, so its state doesn't affect the execution of the loop.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and q, followed by a list of n integers, followed by q pairs of integers l and r.**
