The only variable in the loop head is variable q, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable q. If q is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, q is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, q must be greater than 1.
State: **t is at least 1, index is n+7, results is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO', it1 is less than the length of v1, it2 is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer, q is greater than 1, a is a list of n+1 integers, pf is a list of n+1 integers, mp is a dictionary with key-value pairs, i is n, l is the integer value of data[n+5], r is the integer value of data[n+6], x is pf[r] XOR pf[l-1], v1 is a list containing indices of pf[r], v2 is a list containing indices of pf[l-1], it1 is the insertion point of l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is the insertion point of r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus 1, and stdin contains t-n-5 test cases**
