Output State: **t is at least 2, index is n+2q+n+5, results is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO', n is an integer, q is at least 1, a is a list of n+1 integers where a[i] is an integer for all 1 <= i <= n, pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[i] is an integer equal to pf[i-1] ^ a[i] for all 1 <= i <= n, mp is a dictionary with key-value pairs: 0 maps to a list containing 0, pf[i] maps to a list containing i for all 1 <= i <= n, i is n, l is an integer equal to data[index-2], r is an integer equal to data[index-1], x is an integer equal to pf[r] ^ pf[l-1], and stdin contains t-n-2q-n-4 test cases.**

The code block modifies the index by incrementing it by 2, and assigns the values of data[index-2] and data[index-1] to l and r, respectively. It also calculates the value of x as the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l-1]. The values of t, n, q, a, pf, mp, and i remain unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 2.
