The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n+1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **t is at least 2, index is n+2q+5, results is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO', n is greater than 2, q is an integer, a is a list of n+1 integers where a[1] is an integer and a[2] is an integer and a[3] is an integer, pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[1] is an integer and pf[2] is an integer equal to pf[1] ^ a[2] and pf[3] is an integer, mp is a dictionary with key-value pairs: 0 maps to a list containing 0, pf[1] maps to a list containing 1, pf[2] maps to a list containing 2, i is 3, and stdin contains t-n-2q-5 test cases**
