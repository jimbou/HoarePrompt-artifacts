Output State: **t is at least 1, index is 3, results is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer, q is an integer, a is a list of n+1 zeros, pf is a list of n+1 zeros, mp is a dictionary with a single key-value pair: 0 maps to a list containing 0.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `t` remains unchanged, still being at least 1. The value of `index` has been incremented by 2, now being 3. The `results` list remains empty. The stdin still contains test cases, but one test case has been processed, so it now contains `t-1` test cases. The variables `n` and `q` have been assigned integer values from the first test case in stdin. Two lists, `a` and `pf`, have been created, each containing `n+1` zeros. A dictionary `mp` has been created with a single key-value pair, where the key 0 maps to a list containing a single element, 0.
