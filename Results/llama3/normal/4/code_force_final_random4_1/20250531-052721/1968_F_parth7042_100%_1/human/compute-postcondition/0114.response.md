Based on the precondition, the `results` list contains `t * q` 'YES' or 'NO' appended to it. Since `q` is 0, the `results` list is empty.

The `print` statement prints the elements of the `results` list, joined by newline characters (`\n`). Since the list is empty, there are no elements to print.

Output: **(empty string)**
