Output State: **t is at least 1, index is n+7, results is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' with an additional 'YES' at the end, n is an integer, q is at least 2, a is a list of n+1 integers where a[i] is the integer value of data[i+2] for i in range(1, n+1), pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[i] is pf[i-1] XOR a[i] for i in range(1, n+1), mp is a dictionary with key-value pairs: pf[i] maps to a list containing i for i in range(1, n+1), i is n, l is the integer value of data[n+5], r is the integer value of data[n+6], x is pf[r] XOR pf[l-1], v1 is a list containing l, v2 is a list containing r, it1 is the insertion point of l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is the insertion point of r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus 1, and stdin contains t-n-5 test cases.**

The code appends 'YES' to the results list and then skips to the next iteration of the loop using the continue statement. This means that the values of all other variables remain unchanged. The results list now contains an additional 'YES' at the end.
