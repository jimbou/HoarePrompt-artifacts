Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `index` is `n+2q+n+5`, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' and an additional 'NO', `n` is an integer, `q` is at least 1, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where `a[i]` is an integer for all `1 <= i <= n`, `pf` is a list of `n+1` integers where `pf[i]` is an integer equal to `pf[i-1] ^ a[i]` for all `1 <= i <= n`, `mp` is a dictionary with key-value pairs: `0` maps to a list containing `0`, `pf[i]` maps to a list containing `i` for all `1 <= i <= n`, `i` is `n`, `l` is an integer equal to `data[index-2]`, `r` is an integer equal to `data[index-1]`, `x` is an integer equal to `pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`, `v1` is a list containing `r`, `v2` is a list containing `l-1`, `it1` is an integer equal to the insertion point of `l` in `v1` to maintain sorted order, `it2` is an integer equal to the insertion point of `r` in `v2` to maintain sorted order minus one, and stdin contains `t-n-2q-n-5` test cases. Additionally, either `it1` is equal to the length of `v1`, or `it2` is less than 0, or (`v1[it1]` is not less than `v2[it2]`).**

The code appends 'NO' to the `results` list. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin decreases by 1.
