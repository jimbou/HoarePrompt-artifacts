Output State: **t is at least 2, index is n+2q+6, results is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO', n is greater than 2, q is an integer, a is a list of n+1 integers where a[1] is an integer and a[2] is an integer and a[3] is an integer equal to data[n+2q+5], pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[1] is an integer and pf[2] is an integer equal to pf[1] ^ a[2] and pf[3] is an integer equal to pf[2] ^ a[3], mp is a dictionary with key-value pairs: 0 maps to a list containing 0, pf[1] maps to a list containing 1, pf[2] maps to a list containing 2, pf[3] maps to a list containing 3, i is 3, and stdin contains t-n-2q-6 test cases.**

Explanation:
The code block modifies the values of `index`, `a[i]`, `pf[i]`, and `mp[pf[i]]`. The value of `index` is incremented by 1, making it `n+2q+6`. The value of `a[i]` is updated to `data[n+2q+5]`, which is an integer. The value of `pf[i]` is calculated as `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`, resulting in an integer. The dictionary `mp` is updated with a new key-value pair, where the key is `pf[i]` and the value is a list containing `i`, which is 3. The values of `t`, `n`, `q`, `results`, and `i` remain unchanged. Stdin now contains `t-n-2q-6` test cases.
