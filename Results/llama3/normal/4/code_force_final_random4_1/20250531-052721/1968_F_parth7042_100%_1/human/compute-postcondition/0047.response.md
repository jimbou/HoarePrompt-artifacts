Output State: **t is at least 2, index is n+2q+n+3, results is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO', n is an integer, q is an integer, a is a list of n+1 integers where a[i] is an integer for all 1 <= i <= n, pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[i] is an integer equal to pf[i-1] ^ a[i] for all 1 <= i <= n, mp is a dictionary with key-value pairs: 0 maps to a list containing 0, pf[i] maps to a list containing i for all 1 <= i <= n, i is n, and stdin contains t-n-2q-n-2 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop has executed n times, and the state of the variables has changed accordingly. The index has moved n steps forward, and the prefix sum array pf has been updated to contain the prefix sums of the array a. The dictionary mp has been updated to map each prefix sum to its corresponding index in the array a. The variable i has reached its final value of n, and the number of test cases in stdin has decreased by n. The other variables, t, results, n, and q, remain unchanged.
