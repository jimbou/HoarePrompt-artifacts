Postcondition: ***t is at least 1, index is n+5, results is a list, n is an integer, q is at least 1, a is a list of n+1 integers where a[i] is the integer value of data[i+2] for i in range(1, n+1), pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[i] is pf[i-1] XOR a[i] for i in range(1, n+1), mp is a dictionary with key-value pairs: pf[i] maps to a list containing i for i in range(1, n+1), i is n, l is the integer value of data[n+3], r is the integer value of data[n+4], x is pf[r] XOR pf[l-1], v1 is a list containing l, v2 is a list containing r, it1 is the insertion point of l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is the insertion point of r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus 1, and stdin contains t-n-2 test cases. Either it1 is equal to or larger than the length of v1, or it2 is less than 0, or (v1[it1] is larger than or equal to v2[it2]).***
