Output State: **t is a positive integer, index is 1, results is an empty list, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and q, followed by a list of n integers, followed by q pairs of integers l and r.**

The code first reads the first input from stdin and splits it into a list of strings, storing it in the variable `data`. The first element of `data` is converted to an integer and assigned to the variable `t`, which is a positive integer. The `index` variable is incremented to 1. The `results` variable is initialized as an empty list. The rest of the input in stdin remains unchanged, containing t test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and q, followed by a list of n integers, followed by q pairs of integers l and r.
