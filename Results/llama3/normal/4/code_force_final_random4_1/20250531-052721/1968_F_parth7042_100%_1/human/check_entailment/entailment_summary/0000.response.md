Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is interesting based on the XOR value of its elements. The program uses a prefix array `pf` to store the XOR of all elements up to each index, and a hashmap `mp` to store the indices of elements with the same XOR value. For each query, it checks if there exists a subarray within the given range that has an XOR value equal to the XOR of the subarray from `l` to `r`. If such a subarray exists, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The program also handles the case where the XOR value of the subarray is 0, in which case it prints 'YES' immediately.

Correctness: **True**
