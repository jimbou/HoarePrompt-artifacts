The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an integer equal to data[index-1], `q` is an integer equal to data[index], `index` is n+2q+n+3+2q+3, `a` is a list of n+1 integers where a[1] is data[index-1], `pf` is a list of n+1 integers where pf[1] is pf[0] ^ data[index-1], `mp` is a dictionary with key-value pairs: 0 maps to a list containing 0, pf[1] maps to a list containing 1, `stdin` contains t-n-2q-n-2q-4 test cases, `t` is at least 3, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' with q additional 'YES' or 'NO' appended, `i` is 2, `l` is an integer equal to data[index-2q-2], `r` is an integer equal to data[index-2q-1], `x` is an integer equal to pf[r] ^ pf[l-1], `v1` is a list containing r, `v2` is a list containing l-1, `it1` is an integer equal to the insertion point of l in v1 to maintain sorted order, `it2` is an integer equal to the insertion point of r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus one, `n` must be greater than 1**
