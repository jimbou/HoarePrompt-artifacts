Output State: **n is an integer equal to data[index-n], q is 0, index is n+2q+n+2q+1+2n, a is a list of n+1 integers where a[i] is data[index-n+i-1] for i in range(1, n+1), pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[i] is pf[i-1] ^ a[i] for i in range(1, n+1), mp is a dictionary with key-value pairs: 0 maps to a list containing 0, pf[i] maps to a list containing i for i in range(1, n+1), stdin contains t-n-2q-n-2q-2q-2-n test cases, t is at least 3, results is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' with q additional 'YES' or 'NO' appended and one more 'NO' appended if either it1 is greater than or equal to the length of v1, or it2 is less than 0, or (v1[it1] is greater than or equal to v2[it2]), i is n, l is an integer equal to data[index-2q-1], r is an integer equal to data[index-2q], x is an integer equal to pf[r] ^ pf[l-1], v1 is a list containing r, v2 is a list containing l-1, it1 is an integer equal to the insertion point of l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is an integer equal to the insertion point of r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus one, n must be greater than or equal to 0.**

This output state represents the final state of the program after the loop has executed all its iterations. The loop has finished executing, and the values of the variables in the loop head and body have been updated accordingly. The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body remains unchanged.
