Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to `data[index-n]`, `q` is at least 0, `index` is `n+2q+n+7+2q+2n`, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where `a[i]` is `data[index-n+i-1]` for `i` in range(1, `n+1`), `pf` is a list of `n+1` integers where `pf[i]` is `pf[i-1] ^ a[i]` for `i` in range(1, `n+1`), `mp` is a dictionary with key-value pairs: 0 maps to a list containing 0, `pf[i]` maps to a list containing `i` for `i` in range(1, `n+1`), `stdin` contains `t-n-2q-n-2q-8-n` test cases, `t` is at least 3, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' with `q+2` additional 'YES' or 'NO' appended if `x` is 0 and `it1` is less than the length of `v1`, `it2` is greater than or equal to 0, and `v1[it1]` is less than `v2[it2]`, otherwise `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' with `q+1` additional 'YES' or 'NO' appended if `x` is 0, otherwise `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' with `q` additional 'YES' or 'NO' appended and one more 'NO' appended if either `it1` is greater than or equal to the length of `v1`, or `it2` is less than 0, or (`v1[it1]` is greater than or equal to `v2[it2]`), `i` is `n`, `l` is an integer equal to `data[index-2q-1]`, `r` is an integer equal to `data[index-2q]`, `x` is an integer equal to `pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`, `v1` is a list containing `l`, `v2` is a list containing `l-1`, `it1` is an integer equal to the insertion point of `l` in `v1` to maintain sorted order, `it2` is an integer equal to the insertion point of `r` in `v2` to maintain sorted order minus one, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0. If `x` is 0, `results` has one more 'YES' appended and one more 'NO' appended.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the `results` list has one more 'NO' appended to it. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
