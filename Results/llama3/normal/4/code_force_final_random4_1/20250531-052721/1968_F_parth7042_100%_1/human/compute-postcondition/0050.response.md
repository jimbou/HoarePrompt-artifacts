Postcondition: **t is at least 2, index is n+2q+n+5, results is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO', n is an integer, q is at least 1, a is a list of n+1 integers where a[i] is an integer for all 1 <= i <= n, pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[i] is an integer equal to pf[i-1] ^ a[i] for all 1 <= i <= n, mp is a dictionary with key-value pairs: 0 maps to a list containing 0, pf[i] maps to a list containing i for all 1 <= i <= n, i is n, l is an integer equal to data[index-2], r is an integer equal to data[index-1], and the current value of x is 0, which is equal to pf[r] ^ pf[l-1], and stdin contains t-n-2q-n-4 test cases.**
