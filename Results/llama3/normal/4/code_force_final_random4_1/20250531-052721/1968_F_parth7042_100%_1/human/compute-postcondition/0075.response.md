Output State: **t is at least 2, index is n+2q+n+3+2q, results is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' with q additional 'YES' or 'NO' appended, n is an integer, q is at least 0, a is a list of n+1 integers where a[i] is an integer for all 1 <= i <= n, pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[i] is an integer equal to pf[i-1] ^ a[i] for all 1 <= i <= n, mp is a dictionary with key-value pairs: 0 maps to a list containing 0, pf[i] maps to a list containing i for all 1 <= i <= n, i is n, l is an integer equal to data[index-2q-1], r is an integer equal to data[index-2q], x is an integer equal to pf[r] ^ pf[l-1], v1 is a list containing r, v2 is a list containing l-1, it1 is an integer equal to the insertion point of l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is an integer equal to the insertion point of r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus one, and stdin contains t-n-2q-n-2q-2 test cases. If it1 is less than the length of v1 and it2 is greater than or equal to 0 and v1[it1] is less than v2[it2], then the program executes the if part. Otherwise, the program executes the else part.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has processed all the queries (q) and has appended the results ('YES' or 'NO') to the results list. The index has moved forward by 2q steps, and the remaining test cases in stdin have decreased by 2q. The values of the other variables (t, n, a, pf, mp, i) remain unchanged.
