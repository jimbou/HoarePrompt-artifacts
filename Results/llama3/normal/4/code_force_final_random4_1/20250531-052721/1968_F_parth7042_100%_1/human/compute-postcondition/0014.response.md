Postcondition: ***t is at least 1, index is n+5, results is a list, n is an integer, q is at least 1, a is a list of n+1 integers where a[i] is the integer value of data[i+2] for i in range(1, n+1), pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[i] is pf[i-1] XOR a[i] for i in range(1, n+1), mp is a dictionary with key-value pairs: pf[i] maps to a list containing i for i in range(1, n+1), i is n, l is the integer value of data[n+3], r is the integer value of data[n+4], x is pf[r] XOR pf[l-1]. If x is 0, results contains 'YES', otherwise results is empty, and stdin contains t-n-2 test cases.***
