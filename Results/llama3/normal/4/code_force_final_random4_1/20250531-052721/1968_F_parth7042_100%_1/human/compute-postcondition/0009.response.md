Output State: **t is at least 1, index is n+3, results is an empty list, stdin contains t-n-2 test cases, n is an integer, q is an integer, a is a list of n+1 integers where a[i] is the integer value of data[i+2] for i in range(1, n+1), pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[i] is pf[i-1] XOR a[i] for i in range(1, n+1), mp is a dictionary with key-value pairs: pf[i] maps to a list containing i for i in range(1, n+1), i is n.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

* The value of `t` remains at least 1.
* The value of `index` is incremented by `n` and becomes `n+3`.
* The `results` list remains empty.
* The number of test cases in `stdin` is reduced by `n` and becomes `t-n-2`.
* The value of `n` remains unchanged.
* The value of `q` remains unchanged.
* The list `a` is populated with `n` integers, where each integer at index `i` is the integer value of `data[i+2]`.
* The list `pf` is populated with `n` integers, where each integer at index `i` is the XOR of the previous integer and the integer at index `i` in list `a`.
* The dictionary `mp` is populated with key-value pairs, where each key is the integer at index `i` in list `pf` and the value is a list containing the index `i`.
* The value of `i` becomes `n`.
