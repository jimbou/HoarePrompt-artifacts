Output State: **n is an integer equal to data[index-1], q is an integer equal to data[index], index is n+2q+n+3+2q+3, a is a list of n+1 integers where a[1] is data[index-1], pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[1] is pf[0] ^ data[index-1], mp is a dictionary with key-value pairs: 0 maps to a list containing 0, pf[1] maps to a list containing 1, stdin contains t-n-2q-n-2q-4 test cases, t is at least 3, results is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' with q additional 'YES' or 'NO' appended, i is 1, l is an integer equal to data[index-2q-2], r is an integer equal to data[index-2q-1], x is an integer equal to pf[r] ^ pf[l-1], v1 is a list containing r, v2 is a list containing l-1, it1 is an integer equal to the insertion point of l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is an integer equal to the insertion point of r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus one, n must be greater than 0**

In this final state, the value of `n` is now equal to `data[index-1]`, and the value of `q` is now equal to `data[index]`. The value of `index` has been incremented by 1. The list `a` now contains `n+1` integers, where the second element `a[1]` is equal to `data[index-1]`. The list `pf` now contains `n+1` integers, where the second element `pf[1]` is equal to `pf[0] ^ data[index-1]`. The dictionary `mp` now contains a new key-value pair, where the key is `pf[1]` and the value is a list containing the index `1`. The number of test cases in `stdin` remains the same. The list `results` remains unchanged. The value of `i` remains the same. The values of `l` and `r` have been updated to `data[index-2q-2]` and `data[index-2q-1]`, respectively. The value of `x` is still equal to `pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`. The lists `v1` and `v2` remain unchanged. The values of `it1` and `it2` remain unchanged. The constraint that `n` must be greater than 0 still holds.
