Output State: **n is an integer equal to data[index-2], q is an integer equal to data[index-1], index is n+2q+n+3+2q+4, a is a list of n+1 integers where a[1] is data[index-2], a[2] is data[index-1], pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[1] is pf[0] ^ data[index-2], pf[2] is pf[1] ^ data[index-1], mp is a dictionary with key-value pairs: 0 maps to a list containing 0, pf[1] maps to a list containing 1, pf[2] maps to a list containing 2, stdin contains t-n-2q-n-2q-5 test cases, t is at least 3, results is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' with q additional 'YES' or 'NO' appended, i is 3, l is an integer equal to data[index-2q-2], r is an integer equal to data[index-2q-1], x is an integer equal to pf[r] ^ pf[l-1], v1 is a list containing r, l, v2 is a list containing l-1, r, it1 is an integer equal to the insertion point of l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is an integer equal to the insertion point of r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus one, n must be greater than 1.**

The code block modifies the values of `n`, `q`, `index`, `a`, `pf`, `mp`, `stdin`, `results`, `i`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, and `it2`. The new values are calculated based on the previous values and the operations performed in the code. The output state reflects the updated values of these variables after the execution of the code block.
