Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `index` is `n+2q+n+7`, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' with two additional 'YES' or 'NO' appended, `n` is an integer, `q` is at least 2, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where `a[i]` is an integer for all `1 <= i <= n`, `pf` is a list of `n+1` integers where `pf[i]` is an integer equal to `pf[i-1] ^ a[i]` for all `1 <= i <= n`, `mp` is a dictionary with key-value pairs: `0` maps to a list containing `0`, `pf[i]` maps to a list containing `i` for all `1 <= i <= n`, `i` is `n`, `l` is an integer equal to `data[index-3]`, `r` is an integer equal to `data[index-2]`, `x` is an integer equal to `pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`, `v1` is a list containing `r`, `v2` is a list containing `l-1`, `it1` is an integer equal to the insertion point of `l` in `v1` to maintain sorted order, `it2` is an integer equal to the insertion point of `r` in `v2` to maintain sorted order minus one, and stdin contains `t-n-2q-n-7` test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still at least 2, and `index` is still `n+2q+n+7`. The list `results` now has an additional 'NO' appended to it. The values of `n`, `q`, `a`, `pf`, `mp`, `i`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, and `it2` remain unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin has decreased by 1.
