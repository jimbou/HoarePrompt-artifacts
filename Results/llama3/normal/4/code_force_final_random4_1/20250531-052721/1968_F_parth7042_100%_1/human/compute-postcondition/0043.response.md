The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n+1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is at least 2, `index` is `n+2q+4`, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO', `n` is greater than 1, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where `a[1]` is an integer, `pf` is a list of `n+1` integers where `pf[1]` is an integer, `mp` is a dictionary with key-value pairs: 0 maps to a list containing 0, `pf[1]` maps to a list containing 1, `i` is 2, and `stdin` contains `t-n-2q-3` test cases**
