This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the results. It accepts a number of test cases, each containing two integers n and q, followed by a list of n integers and q pairs of integers l and r. The function then determines whether there exists a subarray within the list of n integers that has an XOR value equal to the XOR of the subarray from l to r. If such a subarray exists, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function repeats this process for each test case and prints the results for all test cases.
