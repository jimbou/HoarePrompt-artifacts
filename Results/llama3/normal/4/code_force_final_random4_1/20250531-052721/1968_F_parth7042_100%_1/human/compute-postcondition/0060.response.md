Output State: **t is at least 2, index is n+2q+n+7, results is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' with an additional 'YES' or 'NO' appended, n is an integer, q is at least 2, a is a list of n+1 integers where a[i] is an integer for all 1 <= i <= n, pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[i] is an integer equal to pf[i-1] ^ a[i] for all 1 <= i <= n, mp is a dictionary with key-value pairs: 0 maps to a list containing 0, pf[i] maps to a list containing i for all 1 <= i <= n, i is n, l is an integer equal to data[index-3], r is an integer equal to data[index-2], x is an integer equal to pf[r] ^ pf[l-1], v1 is a list containing r, v2 is a list containing l-1, it1 is an integer equal to the insertion point of l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is an integer equal to the insertion point of r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus one, and stdin contains t-n-2q-n-6 test cases.**
