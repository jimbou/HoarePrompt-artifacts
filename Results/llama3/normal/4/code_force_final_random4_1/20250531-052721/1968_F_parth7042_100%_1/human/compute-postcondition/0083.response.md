Output State: **n is an integer equal to data[index-3], q is an integer equal to data[index-2], index is n+2q+n+3+2q+5, a is a list of n+1 integers where a[1] is data[index-3], a[2] is data[index-2], a[4] is data[index-1], pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[1] is pf[0] ^ data[index-3], pf[2] is pf[1] ^ data[index-2], pf[4] is pf[3] ^ data[index-1], mp is a dictionary with key-value pairs: 0 maps to a list containing 0, pf[1] maps to a list containing 1, pf[2] maps to a list containing 2, pf[4] maps to a list containing 4, stdin contains t-n-2q-n-2q-6 test cases, t is at least 3, results is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' with q additional 'YES' or 'NO' appended, i is 4, l is an integer equal to data[index-2q-2], r is an integer equal to data[index-2q-1], x is an integer equal to pf[r] ^ pf[l-1], v1 is a list containing r, l, v2 is a list containing l-1, r, it1 is an integer equal to the insertion point of l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is an integer equal to the insertion point of r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus one, n must be greater than 3.**

In this output state, the value of `n` is still an integer equal to `data[index-3]`, and the value of `q` is still an integer equal to `data[index-2]`. The value of `index` has been incremented by 1, so it is now `n+2q+n+3+2q+5`. The list `a` has been updated with a new element at index `i` (which is 4), and its value is `data[index-1]`. The list `pf` has also been updated with a new element at index `i`, and its value is the XOR of `pf[i-1]` and `a[i]`. The dictionary `mp` has been updated with a new key-value pair, where the key is `pf[i]` and the value is a list containing `i`. The number of test cases in `stdin` has been reduced by 1. The list `results` remains unchanged. The values of `i`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, and `it2` remain unchanged.
