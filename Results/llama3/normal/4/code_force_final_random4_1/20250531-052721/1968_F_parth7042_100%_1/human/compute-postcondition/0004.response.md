Output State: **t is at least 1, index is 4, results is an empty list, stdin contains t-2 test cases, n is at least 1, q is an integer, a is a list of n+1 integers where a[1] is the integer value of data[3], pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[1] is pf[0] XOR a[1], mp is a dictionary with a key-value pair: pf[1] maps to a list containing 1, i is 1**

In this output state, the value of `index` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `a[1]` has been set to the integer value of `data[3]`. The value of `pf[1]` has been calculated as the XOR of `pf[0]` and `a[1]`. The dictionary `mp` now has a key-value pair where the key is `pf[1]` and the value is a list containing the index `1`. The value of `i` remains unchanged. All other variables remain unaffected.
