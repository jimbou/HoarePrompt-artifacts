Output State: **t is at least 1, index is n+5, results is a list containing 'YES', n is an integer, q is at least 1, a is a list of n+1 integers where a[i] is the integer value of data[i+2] for i in range(1, n+1), pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[i] is pf[i-1] XOR a[i] for i in range(1, n+1), mp is a dictionary with key-value pairs: pf[i] maps to a list containing i for i in range(1, n+1), i is n, l is the integer value of data[n+3], r is the integer value of data[n+4], x is pf[r] XOR pf[l-1], and the current value of x is 0, stdin contains t-n-2 test cases.**

The code appends 'YES' to the results list and then continues to the next iteration of the loop. The continue statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop and moves on to the next iteration. Therefore, the only change in the output state is that the results list now contains 'YES'. All other variables remain unchanged.
