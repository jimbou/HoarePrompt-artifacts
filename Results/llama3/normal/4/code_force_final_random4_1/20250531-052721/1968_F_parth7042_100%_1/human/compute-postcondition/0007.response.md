The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n+1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 5, `n` is at least 5. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 6 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 5.
State: **t is at least 1, index is 5, results is an empty list, stdin contains t-2 test cases, n is greater than 5, q is an integer, a is a list of n+1 integers where a[1] is the integer value of data[3] and a[5] is the integer value of data[4], pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[1] is pf[0] XOR a[1] and pf[5] is pf[4] XOR a[5], mp is a dictionary with a key-value pair: pf[1] maps to a list containing 1 and pf[5] maps to a list containing 5, i is 6**
