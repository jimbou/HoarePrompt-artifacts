Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is at least 1, index is n+3, results is an empty list, stdin contains t-n-2 test cases, n is an integer, q is an integer, a is a list of n+1 integers where a[i] is the integer value of data[i+2] for i in range(1, n+1), pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[i] is pf[i-1] XOR a[i] for i in range(1, n+1), mp is a dictionary with key-value pairs: pf[i] maps to a list containing i for i in range(1, n+1), i is n.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l = int(data[index])
    r = int(data[index + 1])
    index += 2
    x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
    if x == 0:
        results.append('YES')
        continue
    v1 = mp[pf[r]]
    v2 = mp[pf[l - 1]]
    it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)
    it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
    if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] < v2[it2]:
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is at least 1, index is n+5, results is a list, n is an integer, q is at least 1, a is a list of n+1 integers where a[i] is the integer value of data[i+2] for i in range(1, n+1), pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[i] is pf[i-1] XOR a[i] for i in range(1, n+1), mp is a dictionary with key-value pairs: pf[i] maps to a list containing i for i in range(1, n+1), i is n, l is the integer value of data[n+3], r is the integer value of data[n+4], x is pf[r] XOR pf[l-1], v1 is a list containing l, v2 is a list containing r, it1 is the insertion point of l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is the insertion point of r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus 1, and stdin contains t-n-2 test cases. If it1 is less than the length of v1, it2 is greater than or equal to 0, and v1[it1] is less than v2[it2], then results is a list containing 'YES'. Otherwise, results is a list containing 'NO'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is at least 1, index is n+7, results is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO'. If it1 is less than the length of v1 and it2 is greater than or equal to 0 and (v1[it1] is less than v2[it2]), results has an additional 'YES' at the end. Otherwise, results has an additional 'NO' at the end. If x is 0, results has an additional 'YES' at the end. n is an integer, q is at least 2, a is a list of n+1 integers where a[i] is the integer value of data[i+2] for i in range(1, n+1), pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[i] is pf[i-1] XOR a[i] for i in range(1, n+1), mp is a dictionary with key-value pairs: pf[i] maps to a list containing i for i in range(1, n+1), i is n, l is the integer value of data[n+5], r is the integer value of data[n+6], x is pf[r] XOR pf[l-1], v1 is a list containing indices of pf[r], v2 is a list containing indices of pf[l-1], it1 is the insertion point of l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is the insertion point of r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus 1, and stdin contains t-n-5 test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is at least 1, index is n+9, results is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO', it1 is less than the length of v1, it2 is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer, q is greater than 1, a is a list of n+1 integers, pf is a list of n+1 integers, mp is a dictionary with key-value pairs, i is n, l is the integer value of data[n+7], r is the integer value of data[n+8], x is pf[r] XOR pf[l-1], v1 is a list containing indices of pf[r], v2 is a list containing indices of pf[l-1], it1 is the insertion point of l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is the insertion point of r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus 1. If it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] < v2[it2]), an additional 'YES' is appended to results and stdin contains t-n-8 test cases. Otherwise, an additional 'NO' is appended to results and stdin contains t-n-7 test cases.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
