Output State: **`numbers` is a list containing two sublists [[n, 1], [u_1, u_2]], `num1` is an integer u_1, `num2` is an integer u_2, `nums` is a list containing two strings u and v, where u and v are integers between 1 and n, stdin contains n-3 lines each containing two integers u and v, where u and v are integers between 1 and n.**

In this output state, the values of `numbers`, `num1`, and `num2` remain unchanged. The value of `nums` is updated to a list containing two strings `u` and `v`, which are the next two integers in the input. The stdin now contains `n-3` lines of input, each containing two integers `u` and `v`, where `u` and `v` are integers between 1 and `n`.
