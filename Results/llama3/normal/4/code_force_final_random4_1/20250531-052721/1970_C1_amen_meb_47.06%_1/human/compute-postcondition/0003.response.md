Postcondition: **`numbers` is an empty list, `nums` is a list containing two integers n and t, where n is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and t is 1, stdin contains n-1 lines each containing two integers u and v, where u and v are integers between 1 and n, and finally one integer u_1, where u_1 is an integer between 1 and n. The current value of `nums` has a length not equal to 2.**
