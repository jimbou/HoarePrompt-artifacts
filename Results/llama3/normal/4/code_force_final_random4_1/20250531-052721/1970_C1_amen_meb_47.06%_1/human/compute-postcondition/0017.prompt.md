Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `numbers` is an empty list, stdin contains three inputs: first two integers n and t, where n is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and t is 1, then n-1 lines each containing two integers u and v, where u and v are integers between 1 and n, and finally one integer u_1, where u_1 is an integer between 1 and n.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    nums = input().split()
    if len(nums) != 2:
        break
    num1 = int(nums[0])
    num2 = int(nums[1])
    numbers.append([num1, num2])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: numbers is a list containing one sublist [n, 1], num1 is an integer greater than or equal to 2, num2 is 1, nums is a list containing two integers n and 1, where n is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and 1 is 1, stdin contains n-1 lines each containing two integers u and v, where u and v are integers between 1 and n, and finally one integer u_1, where u_1 is an integer between 1 and n.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: numbers is a list containing two sublists [[n, 1], [u_1, u_2]], num1 is an integer u_1, num2 is an integer u_2, nums is a list containing two integers u_1 and u_2, stdin contains n-2 lines each containing two integers u and v, where u and v are integers between 1 and n.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: numbers is a list containing three sublists [[n, 1], [u_1, u_2], [u, v]], num1 is an integer u, num2 is an integer v, nums is a list containing two strings u and v, where u and v are integers between 1 and n, stdin contains n-3 lines each containing two integers u and v, where u and v are integers between 1 and n.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
