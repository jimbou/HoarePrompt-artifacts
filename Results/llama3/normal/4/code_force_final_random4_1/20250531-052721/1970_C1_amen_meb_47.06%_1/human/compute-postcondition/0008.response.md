Output State: **numbers is a list containing one sublist [n, 1], num1 is an integer greater than or equal to 2, num2 is 1, nums is a list containing one integer u_1, where u_1 is an integer between 1 and n, stdin contains n-2 lines each containing two integers u and v, where u and v are integers between 1 and n**

In this output state, the value of nums has been updated to contain one integer u_1, which is an integer between 1 and n. The stdin now contains n-2 lines each containing two integers u and v, where u and v are integers between 1 and n. The values of the other variables, numbers, num1, and num2, remain unchanged.
