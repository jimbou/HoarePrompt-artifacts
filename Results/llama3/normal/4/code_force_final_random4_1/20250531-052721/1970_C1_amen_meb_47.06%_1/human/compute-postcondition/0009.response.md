Output State: **numbers is a list containing one sublist [n, 1], num1 is an integer greater than or equal to 2, num2 is 1, nums is a list containing one integer u_1, where u_1 is an integer between 1 and n, stdin contains n-2 lines each containing two integers u and v, where u and v are integers between 1 and n, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. The list "numbers" still contains one sublist [n, 1]. The variable "num1" is still an integer greater than or equal to 2. The variable "num2" is still 1. The list "nums" still contains one integer u_1, where u_1 is an integer between 1 and n. The stdin still contains n-2 lines each containing two integers u and v, where u and v are integers between 1 and n.
