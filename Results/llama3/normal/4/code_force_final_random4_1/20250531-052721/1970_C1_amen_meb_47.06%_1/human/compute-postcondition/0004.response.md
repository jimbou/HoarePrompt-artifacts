Output State: **`numbers` is an empty list, `nums` is a list containing two integers n and t, where n is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and t is 1, stdin contains n-1 lines each containing two integers u and v, where u and v are integers between 1 and n, and finally one integer u_1, where u_1 is an integer between 1 and n, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `numbers` and `nums` remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains the same input. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
