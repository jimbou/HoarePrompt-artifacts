Output State: **`numbers` is an empty list, `nums` is a list containing two integers n and t, where n is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and t is 1, stdin contains n-1 lines each containing two integers u and v, where u and v are integers between 1 and n, and finally one integer u_1, where u_1 is an integer between 1 and n.**

In this output state, the variable `nums` has been assigned the list of two integers `n` and `t` from the input, where `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and `t` is 1. The stdin now contains `n-1` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, where `u` and `v` are integers between 1 and `n`, and finally one integer `u_1`, where `u_1` is an integer between 1 and `n`. The value of `numbers` remains unchanged as an empty list.
