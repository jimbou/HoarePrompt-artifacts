Output State: **`numbers` is a list containing two sublists [[n, 1], [u_1, u_2]], `num1` is an integer u_1, `num2` is an integer u_2, `nums` is a list containing two strings u and v, where u and v are integers between 1 and n, stdin contains n-3 lines each containing two integers u and v, where u and v are integers between 1 and n, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `numbers`, `num1`, `num2`, and `nums` remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains n-3 lines of input.
