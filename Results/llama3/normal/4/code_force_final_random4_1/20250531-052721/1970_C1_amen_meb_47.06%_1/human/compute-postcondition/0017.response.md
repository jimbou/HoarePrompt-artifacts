Output State: **numbers is a list containing n-1 sublists [[n, 1], [u_1, u_2], ..., [u_(n-2), u_(n-1)]], num1 is an integer u_(n-1), num2 is an integer u_n, nums is a list containing two strings u_(n-1) and u_n, stdin contains one integer u_n, where u_n is an integer between 1 and n.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list "numbers" will contain n-1 sublists, each containing two integers. The first sublist will contain the initial values of n and 1, and the remaining sublists will contain the values of u and v from the input lines. The variables num1 and num2 will hold the last values of u and v from the input lines, and the list "nums" will contain these last two values as strings. The stdin will contain only one integer, which is the last value of u_n.
