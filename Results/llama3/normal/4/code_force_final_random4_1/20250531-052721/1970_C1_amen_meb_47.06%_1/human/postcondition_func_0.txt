The function reads input from stdin, expecting a sequence of integers in a specific format, and returns a list of sublists containing these integers. The input sequence starts with two integers, n and t, followed by n-1 lines of two integers each, and finally one integer. The function reads this input, constructs a list of sublists from the integers, and returns this list. The returned list contains n-1 sublists, where the first sublist contains the first two integers n and 1, and the remaining sublists contain the subsequent integers. The last sublist contains the last two integers read from the input.
