Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute again regardless of the state of the variables. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state.

State: **numbers is a list containing two sublists [[n, 1], [u_1, u_2]], num1 is an integer u_1, num2 is an integer u_2, nums is a list containing two integers u_1 and u_2, stdin contains n-2 lines each containing two integers u and v, where u and v are integers between 1 and n.**
