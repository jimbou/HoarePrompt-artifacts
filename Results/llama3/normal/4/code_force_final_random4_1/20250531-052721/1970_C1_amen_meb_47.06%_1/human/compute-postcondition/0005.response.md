Postcondition: ***`numbers` is an empty list, `nums` is a list containing two integers n and t, where n is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and t is 1, stdin contains n-1 lines each containing two integers u and v, where u and v are integers between 1 and n, and finally one integer u_1, where u_1 is an integer between 1 and n. If the length of `nums` is not equal to 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
