Postcondition: ***numbers is a list containing one sublist [n, 1], num1 is an integer greater than or equal to 2, num2 is 1, nums is a list containing one integer u_1, where u_1 is an integer between 1 and n, stdin contains n-2 lines each containing two integers u and v, where u and v are integers between 1 and n. If the length of nums is not equal to 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
