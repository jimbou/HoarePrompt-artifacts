Postcondition: **`numbers` is a list containing two sublists [[n, 1], [u_1, u_2]], `num1` is an integer u_1, `num2` is an integer u_2, `nums` is a list containing two strings u and v, where u and v are integers between 1 and n, stdin contains n-3 lines each containing two integers u and v, where u and v are integers between 1 and n. If the length of `nums` is not equal to 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the current state of the variables.**
