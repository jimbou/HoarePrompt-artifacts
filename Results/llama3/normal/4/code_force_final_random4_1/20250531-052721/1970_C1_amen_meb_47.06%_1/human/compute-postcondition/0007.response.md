Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute again regardless of the state of the variables. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state.

State: **numbers is a list containing one sublist [n, 1], num1 is an integer greater than or equal to 2, num2 is 1, nums is a list containing two integers n and 1, where n is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and 1 is 1, stdin contains n-1 lines each containing two integers u and v, where u and v are integers between 1 and n, and finally one integer u_1, where u_1 is an integer between 1 and n**
