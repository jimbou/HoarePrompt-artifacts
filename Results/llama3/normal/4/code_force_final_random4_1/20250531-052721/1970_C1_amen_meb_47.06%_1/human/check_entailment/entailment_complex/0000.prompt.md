Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
This is the easy version of the problem. The difference in this version is
that t=1 and we work on an array-like tree.

Ron and Hermione are playing a game on a tree of n nodes that are initially
inactive. This tree is special because it has exactly two leaves. It can thus
be seen as an array. The game consists of t rounds, each of which starts with
a stone on exactly one node, which is considered as activated. A move consists
of picking an inactive neighbor of the node with a stone on it and moving the
stone there (thus activating this neighbor). Ron makes the first move, after
which he alternates with Hermione until no valid move is available. The player
that cannot make a move loses the round. If both players play optimally, who
wins each round of this game?

Note that all the rounds are played with the same tree; only the starting node
changes. Moreover, after each round, all active nodes are considered inactive
again.

Input

The first line contains integers n (2 \leq n \leq 2\times 10^5 ), t (t=1 ),
the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively.

The next n-1 lines contain two integers 1 \leq u, v \leq n each, corresponding
to an edge of the tree. It is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves.

The next line contains t integers 1 \leq u_1 , \dots, u_t \leq n ,
corresponding to the node where the stone is initially put.

Output

The output consists of t=1 line which is either "Ron" or "Hermione".

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains three inputs: first two integers n and t, where n is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and t is 1, then n-1 lines each containing two integers u and v, where u and v are integers between 1 and n, and finally one integer u_1, where u_1 is an integer between 1 and n.
    numbers = []
    while True:
        nums = input().split()
        
        if len(nums) != 2:
            break
        
        num1 = int(nums[0])
        
        num2 = int(nums[1])
        
        numbers.append([num1, num2])
        
    #State: numbers is a list containing n-1 sublists [[n, 1], [u_1, u_2], ..., [u_(n-2), u_(n-1)]], num1 is an integer u_(n-1), num2 is an integer u_n, nums is a list containing two strings u_(n-1) and u_n, stdin contains one integer u_n, where u_n is an integer between 1 and n.
    return numbers
    #The program returns a list of n-1 sublists, where the first sublist contains two integers n and 1, and the remaining sublists contain integers u_1 to u_(n-1), and the last sublist contains an integer u_(n-1) which is also the value of num1, and the last integer u_n which is also the value of num2 and is also present in the stdin and is a string in the list nums.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from stdin, expecting a sequence of integers in a specific format, and returns a list of sublists containing these integers. The input sequence starts with two integers, n and t, followed by n-1 lines of two integers each, and finally one integer. The function reads this input, constructs a list of sublists from the integers, and returns this list. The returned list contains n-1 sublists, where the first sublist contains the first two integers n and 1, and the remaining sublists contain the subsequent integers. The last sublist contains the last two integers read from the input.
