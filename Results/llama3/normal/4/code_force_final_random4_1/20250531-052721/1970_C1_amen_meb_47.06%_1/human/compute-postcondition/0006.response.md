Output State: **numbers is a list containing one sublist [n, 1], num1 is an integer greater than or equal to 2, num2 is 1, nums is a list containing two integers n and 1, where n is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and 1 is 1, stdin contains n-1 lines each containing two integers u and v, where u and v are integers between 1 and n, and finally one integer u_1, where u_1 is an integer between 1 and n.**

In this output state, the list `numbers` now contains a single sublist `[n, 1]`, where `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2. The variables `num1` and `num2` have been assigned the values of `n` and 1, respectively. The list `nums` remains unchanged, containing the two integers `n` and 1. The state of `stdin` is also unchanged, containing `n-1` lines of two integers each, followed by a single integer `u_1`.
