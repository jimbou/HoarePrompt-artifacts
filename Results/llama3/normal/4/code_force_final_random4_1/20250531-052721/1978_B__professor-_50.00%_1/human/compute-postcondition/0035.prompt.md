Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9)
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if b <= a:
        print(n * a)
    elif b - a >= n:
        print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2))
    else:
        print(int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the product of `n` and `a` is being printed. If `b` is greater than `a`, then if the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the sum of all integers from `b - n + 1` to `b` (inclusive) is being printed. Otherwise, the sum of the arithmetic series with `n` terms, first term `a`, and common difference `(b - a) / 2` is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer from the first test case, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) from the first test case, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) from the first test case, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the product of `n` and `a` is printed. Otherwise, if `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the integer part of the result of the formula `(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2` is printed. Otherwise, the value of the expression `(b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the product of `n` and `a` is printed. Otherwise, if `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the integer value of the expression `(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2` is printed. Otherwise, the integer value of the expression `((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)` is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
