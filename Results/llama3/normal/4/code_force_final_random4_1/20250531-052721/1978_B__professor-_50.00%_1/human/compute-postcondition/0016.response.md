The code `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` assigns the values from the input to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. Since the input contains multiple test cases - 1, the first test case is assigned to `n`, `a`, and `b`. The values of `t` and `_` are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer from the first test case, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) from the first test case, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) from the first test case, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2.**
