The code prints the result of a mathematical expression involving the variables `a`, `b`, and `n`. 

The expression `(b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1)` calculates the sum of an arithmetic series with `b - a` terms, where the first term is `a` and the last term is `b`. This is equivalent to the sum of an arithmetic series with `b - a + 1` terms, where the first term is `a` and the common difference is `1`.

The expression `a * n` calculates the product of `a` and `n`.

The entire expression `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)` calculates the sum of the arithmetic series and the product of `a` and `n`, and then converts the result to an integer.

Output: **the sum of the arithmetic series with b - a terms, where the first term is a and the last term is b, plus the product of a and n (where a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9, and n is an integer)**
