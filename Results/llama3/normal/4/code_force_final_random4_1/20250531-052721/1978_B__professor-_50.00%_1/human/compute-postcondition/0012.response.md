The code prints the result of the formula `(b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n`, where `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `b` is greater than `a`, and the difference between `b` and `a` is less than `n`. The formula calculates the sum of an arithmetic series with `n` terms, where the first term is `a` and the common difference is `(b - a) / 2`. The result is an integer because the division is performed using integer division (`//`).
Output: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, `b` is greater than `a`, and the difference between `b` and `a` is less than `n`, and the sum of the arithmetic series with `n` terms, first term `a`, and common difference `(b - a) / 2` is being printed**
