Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the integers read from the input, which is a space-separated list of integers. The stdin now contains one less test case.
