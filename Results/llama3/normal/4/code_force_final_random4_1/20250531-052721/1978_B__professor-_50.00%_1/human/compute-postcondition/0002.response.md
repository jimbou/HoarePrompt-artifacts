Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**.

In this output state, the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged. The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` are assigned the values of the three integers from the input, where `input().split()` accepts a space-separated list of integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. Since one test case has been read from the input, the number of remaining test cases in stdin is reduced by 1.
