The code prints the result of the expression `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`. 

In this expression, `(b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1)` calculates the sum of an arithmetic series with `n` terms, where the first term is `a` and the last term is `b`. The formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is `n * (a + b) / 2`, but since `n` is not the number of terms in the series, we use the formula `(b - a + 1) * (b - a) / 2` to calculate the sum of the series from `a` to `b`. 

Then, `a * n` adds the product of `a` and `n` to the sum.

So, the code prints the sum of the arithmetic series from `a` to `b` plus the product of `a` and `n`.

Output: **the sum of the arithmetic series from a to b plus the product of a and n (where a and b are integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, and n is an integer)**
