The code prints the calculated value of the expression `(b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n`, where `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) from the first test case, and `n` is an integer from the first test case.
Output: ** `t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer from the first test case, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) from the first test case, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) from the first test case, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2, and the value of the expression `(b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n` is printed**
