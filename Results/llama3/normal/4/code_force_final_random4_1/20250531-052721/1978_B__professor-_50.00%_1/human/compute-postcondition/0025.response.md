The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `t` is an integer greater than 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time `_` is 2 and `t` is an integer greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer from the first test case, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) from the first test case, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) from the first test case, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2.**
