Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer from the first test case, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) from the first test case, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) from the first test case, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the product of `n` and `a` is printed. Otherwise, if `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the integer part of the result of the formula `(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2` is printed. Otherwise, the value of the expression `(b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n` is printed.***
