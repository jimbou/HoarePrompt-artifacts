Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `_` is equal to `t`, `n` is an integer from the last test case, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) from the last test case, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) from the last test case, stdin contains no test cases.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be the same as it was initially, but the variable `_` will be equal to `t`, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` will hold the values from the last test case that was processed. The standard input (stdin) will be empty, as all test cases will have been processed.
