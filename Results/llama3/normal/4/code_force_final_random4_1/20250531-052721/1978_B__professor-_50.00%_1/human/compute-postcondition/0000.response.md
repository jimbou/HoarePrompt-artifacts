The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. Since the stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing three integers, the first integer is assigned to `t`. The remaining test cases are still in the stdin. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9)**
