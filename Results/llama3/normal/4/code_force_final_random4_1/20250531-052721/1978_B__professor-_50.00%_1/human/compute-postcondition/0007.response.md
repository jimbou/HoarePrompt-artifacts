Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, `b` is greater than `a`, and the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`.**
