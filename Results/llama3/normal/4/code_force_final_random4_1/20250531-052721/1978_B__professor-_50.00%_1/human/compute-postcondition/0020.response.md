Output: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer from the first test case, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) from the first test case, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) from the first test case, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2, and this is printed: the integer part of the result of the formula (2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2, where b is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) from the first test case and n is an integer from the first test case**
