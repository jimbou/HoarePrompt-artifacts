The code prints the result of the expression `(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2`, which is an integer.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

* `2 * b`: This expression multiplies the value of `b` by 2. Since `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), the result of this expression will be an even integer between 2 and 2 * 10^9 (inclusive).
* `- n + 1`: This expression subtracts the value of `n` from the result of the previous expression and then adds 1. Since `n` is an integer, the result of this expression will be an integer.
* `* n / 2`: This expression multiplies the result of the previous expression by `n` and then divides the result by 2. Since `n` is an integer, the result of this expression will be an integer.

Therefore, the output will be an integer that represents the result of the expression `(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2`.

Output: **(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2 (where b is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), n is an integer)**
