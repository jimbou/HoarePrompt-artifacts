Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, and `b` is greater than `a`. If the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the sum of all integers from `b - n + 1` to `b` (inclusive) is being printed. Otherwise, the sum of the arithmetic series with `n` terms, first term `a`, and common difference `(b - a) / 2` is being printed.***
