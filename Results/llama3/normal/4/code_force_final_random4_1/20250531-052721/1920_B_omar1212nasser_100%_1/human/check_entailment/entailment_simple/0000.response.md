Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve a game problem where Alice and Bob take turns removing and negating elements from an array to maximize and minimize the sum, respectively. The program uses two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. 

`func_1` reads the input, sorts the array, and calls `func_2` to calculate the maximum sum after Alice's and Bob's moves. 

`func_2` calculates the maximum sum by considering all possible removals and negations. It first calculates the sum of all elements minus twice the sum of the last `x` elements (where `x` is the number of elements Bob can negate). Then, it iteratively removes the last `i` elements and updates the sum by subtracting the removed elements and adding the element at index `-(x + i)` if it exists. The maximum sum is then returned.

The program correctly implements the game logic and calculates the maximum sum after Alice's and Bob's moves. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
