Output State: **`removals` is greater than 0, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `pos` is a list containing one element which is the sum of all elements in `elements` minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`, `s` is the sum of all elements in `elements` minus the last element, `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements` minus the last element plus the element at index `-(negatives + i)` in `elements`, `i` is 1, and the current value of `negatives` plus `i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s2` has been updated by adding the element at index `-(negatives + i)` in the sorted list `elements`. All other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `removals`, `negatives`, `elements`, `pos`, `s`, and `i` are still valid.
