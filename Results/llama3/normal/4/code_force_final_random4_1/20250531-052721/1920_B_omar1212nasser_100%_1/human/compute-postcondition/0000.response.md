Output State: **removals is a non-negative integer, negatives is a non-negative integer, elements is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, pos is a list containing one element which is the sum of all elements in elements minus twice the sum of the last negatives elements in elements, s is the sum of all elements in elements, s2 is the sum of the last negatives elements in elements.**

In this output state, the values of `removals` and `negatives` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The list `elements` also remains unchanged as it is only used for calculations and not modified in place. The list `pos` is initialized and appended with a single element, which is the sum of all elements in `elements` minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`. The variable `s` is assigned the sum of all elements in `elements`, and the variable `s2` is assigned the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`.
