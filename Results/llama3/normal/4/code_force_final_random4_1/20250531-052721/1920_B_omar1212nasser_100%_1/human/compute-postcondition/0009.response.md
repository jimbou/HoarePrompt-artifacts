Output State: **removals is greater than 1, negatives is a non-negative integer, elements is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, pos is a list containing two elements where the first element is the sum of all elements in elements minus twice the sum of the last negatives elements in elements, and the second element is the sum of all elements in elements minus the last element minus twice the sum of the last negatives elements in elements minus the last element plus the element at index -(negatives + i) in elements if negatives + i is less than or equal to the length of elements, otherwise the second element is the sum of all elements in elements minus the last element minus twice the sum of the last negatives elements in elements minus the last element, s is the sum of all elements in elements minus the last element minus the element at index -i in elements, and s2 is the sum of the last negatives elements in elements minus the last element minus the element at index -i in elements plus the element at index -(negatives + i) in elements if negatives + i is less than or equal to the length of elements, otherwise s2 is the sum of the last negatives elements in elements minus the last element minus the element at index -i in elements, and i is 2, and s2 is increased by the element at index -(negatives + i) in elements.**

In this output state, the value of s2 is increased by the element at index -(negatives + i) in elements. The values of the other variables are not affected.
