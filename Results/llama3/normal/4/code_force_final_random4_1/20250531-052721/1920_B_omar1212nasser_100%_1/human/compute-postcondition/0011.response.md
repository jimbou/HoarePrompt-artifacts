Output State: **`removals` is greater than 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `pos` is a list containing three elements where the first element is the sum of all elements in `elements` minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`, the second element is the sum of all elements in `elements` minus the last element minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements` minus the last element plus the element at index `-(negatives + i)` in `elements` if `negatives + i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, otherwise the second element is the sum of all elements in `elements` minus the last element minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements` minus the last element, and the third element is `s - 2 * s2`, `s` is the sum of all elements in `elements` minus the last element minus the element at index `-i` in `elements`, `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements` minus the last element minus the element at index `-i` in `elements` plus the element at index `-(negatives + i)` in `elements` if `negatives + i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, otherwise `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements` minus the last element minus the element at index `-i` in `elements`, and `i` is 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `pos` now has three elements, where the first two elements are the same as before, and the third element is the difference between `s` and twice `s2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
