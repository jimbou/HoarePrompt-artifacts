Output State: **The program returns the maximum value from the list 'pos', which contains elements calculated based on the list 'elements', the number of removals, and the number of negatives. The maximum value is the largest sum of all elements in 'elements' minus the last 'i' elements minus twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in 'elements' minus the last 'i' elements, plus the element at index -(negatives + i) in 'elements' if negatives + i is less than or equal to the length of 'elements', otherwise the maximum value is the largest sum of all elements in 'elements' minus the last 'i' elements minus twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in 'elements' minus the last 'i' elements.**
