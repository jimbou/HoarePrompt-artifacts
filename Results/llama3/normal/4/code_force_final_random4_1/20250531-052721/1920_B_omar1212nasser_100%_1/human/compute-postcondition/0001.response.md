According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `removals`. If `removals` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, removals is a non-negative integer does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `removals` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 1.

State: **`removals` is greater than 0, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `pos` is a list containing one element which is the sum of all elements in elements minus twice the sum of the last negatives elements in elements, `s` is the sum of all elements in elements, `s2` is the sum of the last negatives elements in elements, `i` is 1**
