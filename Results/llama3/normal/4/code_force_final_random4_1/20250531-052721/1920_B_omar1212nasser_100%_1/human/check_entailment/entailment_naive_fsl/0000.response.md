Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program is correct because it accurately implements the game strategy described in the problem description. 

Function 1 reads the input and calls Function 2 to calculate the maximum sum of elements after the game.

Function 2 sorts the array in ascending order and then calculates the maximum sum by considering all possible removals and negations. It maintains a list `pos` to store the maximum sum for each possible removal and negation. 

The key insight here is that the maximum sum is achieved when Alice removes the smallest elements and Bob negates the largest elements. By iterating over all possible removals and negations, the function ensures that it considers all possible scenarios and returns the maximum sum.

The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when the number of removals or negations is 0, or when the array is empty. It also handles cases where the number of removals or negations is greater than the length of the array.

Overall, the program accurately implements the game strategy and handles all possible cases, making it correct.
