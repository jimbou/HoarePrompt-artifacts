Output State: **removals is greater than 0, negatives is a non-negative integer, elements is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, pos is a list containing one element which is the sum of all elements in elements minus twice the sum of the last negatives elements in elements, s is the sum of all elements in elements minus the last element, s2 is the sum of the last negatives elements in elements minus the last element, i is 1**

In this output state, the values of `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements` remain unchanged. The value of `pos` is updated to reflect the new sum of all elements in `elements` minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`. The value of `s` is updated to be the sum of all elements in `elements` minus the last element, and the value of `s2` is updated to be the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements` minus the last element. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 1.
