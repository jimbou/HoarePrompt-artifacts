Calculates the maximum sum of elements in a sorted list, considering removals and negatives. The function takes a sorted list of integers, a non-negative integer for removals, and a non-negative integer for negatives. It returns the maximum value from a list of sums, where each sum is calculated by subtracting the last 'i' elements and twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements, and adding the element at index -(negatives + i) if within bounds. The function effectively determines the largest possible sum after removing elements and accounting for negative values.
