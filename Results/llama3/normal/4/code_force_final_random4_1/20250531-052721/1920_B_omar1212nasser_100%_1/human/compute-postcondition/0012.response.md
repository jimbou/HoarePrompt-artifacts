To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, removals + 1):`. The only objects in the loop head are `i` and `removals`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `removals`. If `i` is less than `removals + 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `removals` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. Since `removals` is greater than 1, it must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`removals` is at least 3, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `pos` is a list containing three elements where the first element is the sum of all elements in `elements` minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`, the second element is the sum of all elements in `elements` minus the last element minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements` minus the last element plus the element at index `-(negatives + i)` in `elements` if `negatives + i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, otherwise the second element is the sum of all elements in `elements` minus the last element minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements` minus the last element, and the third element is `s - 2 * s2`, `s` is the sum of all elements in `elements` minus the last element minus the element at index `-i` in `elements`, `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements` minus the last element minus the element at index `-i` in `elements` plus the element at index `-(negatives + i)` in `elements` if `negatives + i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, otherwise `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements` minus the last element minus the element at index `-i` in `elements`, and `i` is 3**
