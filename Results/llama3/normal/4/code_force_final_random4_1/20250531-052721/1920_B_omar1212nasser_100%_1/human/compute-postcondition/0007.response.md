The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `removals`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `removals`. If `i` is less than `removals`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `removals` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `removals` must be greater than 1.

State: **`removals` is greater than 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `pos` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the sum of all elements in `elements` minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`, and the second element is the sum of all elements in `elements` minus the last element minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements` minus the last element plus the element at index `-(negatives + i)` in `elements` if `negatives + i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, otherwise the second element is the sum of all elements in `elements` minus the last element minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements` minus the last element, `s` is the sum of all elements in `elements` minus the last element, `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements` minus the last element plus the element at index `-(negatives + i)` in `elements` if `negatives + i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, otherwise `s2` remains the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements` minus the last element, and `i` is 2**
