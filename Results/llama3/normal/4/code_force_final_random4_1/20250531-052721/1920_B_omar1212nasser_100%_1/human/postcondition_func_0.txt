This function takes no parameters and returns no value. It reads a number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of elements, a target value, and a list of non-negative integers. It sorts the list and calls another function (func_2) with the target value, the sorted list, and the number of elements as arguments. The result of func_2 is then printed. The function does not modify the input values.
