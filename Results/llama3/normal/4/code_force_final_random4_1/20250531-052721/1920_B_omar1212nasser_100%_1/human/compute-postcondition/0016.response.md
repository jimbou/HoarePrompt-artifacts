Output State: **`removals` is at least 3, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `pos` is a list containing four elements where the first element is the sum of all elements in `elements` minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`, the second element is the sum of all elements in `elements` minus the last element minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements` minus the last element plus the element at index `-(negatives + i)` in `elements` if `negatives + i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, otherwise the second element is the sum of all elements in `elements` minus the last element minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements` minus the last element, the third element is `s - 2 * s2`, and the fourth element is `s - 2 * s2`, `s` is the sum of all elements in `elements` minus the last element minus the element at index `-i` in `elements`, `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements` minus the last element minus the element at index `-i` in `elements` plus the element at index `-(negatives + i)` in `elements` if `negatives + i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, otherwise `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements` minus the last element minus the element at index `-i` in `elements`, and `i` is 3.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `pos` now contains four elements, where the first three elements are the same as before, and the fourth element is the same as the third element, which is `s - 2 * s2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
