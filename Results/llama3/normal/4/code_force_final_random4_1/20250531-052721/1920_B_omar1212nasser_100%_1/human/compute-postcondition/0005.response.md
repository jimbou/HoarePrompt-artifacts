Postcondition: ***`removals` is greater than 0, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `pos` is a list containing one element which is the sum of all elements in `elements` minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`, `s` is the sum of all elements in `elements` minus the last element, `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements` minus the last element plus the element at index `-(negatives + i)` in `elements` if `negatives + i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, otherwise `s2` remains the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements` minus the last element, and `i` is 1.***
