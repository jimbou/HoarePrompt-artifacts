Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where the first element is the number of test cases, and each subsequent element is a list of integers where the first two elements are the number of cows and the index of the cow, and the remaining elements are the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, `x` is a list of integers where the first two elements are the number of cows and the index of the cow, and the remaining elements are the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, if `a[i]` is greater than `x`, then `ind` is a list containing the integer 1, `c` is 1, `k` is an integer, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ind`, `c`, `k`, `n`, `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `a`, `x`, `ind`, `c`, `k`, `n`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The condition `a[i]` is greater than `x` is still valid, and if it is true, then `ind` is a list containing the integer 1, `c` is 1, `k` is an integer, `n` is greater than 1, and `i` is 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to these variables.
