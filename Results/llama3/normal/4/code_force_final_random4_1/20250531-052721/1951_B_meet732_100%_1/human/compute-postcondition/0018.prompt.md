Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is a list of integers where the first element is the number of test cases, and each subsequent element is a list of integers where the first two elements are the number of cows and the index of the cow, and the remaining elements are the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, x is a list of integers where the first two elements are the number of cows and the index of the cow, and the remaining elements are the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, ind is an empty list, c is 0, k is an integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] > x:
        ind.append(i)
        c += 1
    if c == 2:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *a is a list of integers where the first element is the number of test cases, and each subsequent element is a list of integers where the first two elements are the number of cows and the index of the cow, and the remaining elements are the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, x is a list of integers where the first two elements are the number of cows and the index of the cow, and the remaining elements are the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. If c is 2, then ind is a list containing the value of i and c is 1, k is an integer, n must be greater than 0, i is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, ind remains an empty list and c remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *a is a list of integers where the first element is the number of test cases, and each subsequent element is a list of integers where the first two elements are the number of cows and the index of the cow, and the remaining elements are the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, x is a list of integers where the first two elements are the number of cows and the index of the cow, and the remaining elements are the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. If c is 2, then if a[i] is greater than x, ind is a list containing the integer 1, c is 1, k is an integer, n is greater than 1, i is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to ind, c, k, n, i and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of integers where the first element is the number of test cases, and each subsequent element is a list of integers where the first two elements are the number of cows and the index of the cow, and the remaining elements are the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, `x` is a list of integers where the first two elements are the number of cows and the index of the cow, and the remaining elements are the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, `ind` is a list containing the integer 1 (if the condition was not met) or the integers 1 and 2 (if the condition was met), `c` is 1 (if the condition was not met) or 2 (if the condition was met), `k` is an integer, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is greater than `x`, then `ind` contains the integers 1 and 2, and `c` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ind` contains the integer 1, and `c` is 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
