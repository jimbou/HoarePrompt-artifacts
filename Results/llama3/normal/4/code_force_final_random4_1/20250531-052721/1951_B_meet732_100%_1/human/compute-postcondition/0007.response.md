Postcondition: ***a is a list of integers where the first element is the number of test cases, and each subsequent element is a list of integers where the first two elements are the number of cows and the index of the cow, and the remaining elements are the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, x is a list of integers where the first two elements are the number of cows and the index of the cow, and the remaining elements are the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. If c is 2, then ind is a list containing the value of i and c is 1, k is an integer, n must be greater than 0, i is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, ind remains an empty list and c remains 0.***
