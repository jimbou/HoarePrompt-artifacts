Postcondition: **a is a list of integers where the first element is the number of test cases, and each subsequent element is a list of integers where the first two elements are the number of cows and the index of the cow, and the remaining elements are the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, x is a list of integers where the first two elements are the number of cows and the index of the cow, and the remaining elements are the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, if the current value of a[i] is greater than x, then ind is a list containing the value of i and c is 1. Otherwise, ind remains an empty list and c remains 0. In both cases, k is an integer, n must be greater than 0, and i is 0. The current value of c is 2.**
