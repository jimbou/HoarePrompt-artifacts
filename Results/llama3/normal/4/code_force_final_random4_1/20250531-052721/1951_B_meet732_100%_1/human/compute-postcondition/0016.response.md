Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where the first element is the number of test cases, and each subsequent element is a list of integers where the first two elements are the number of cows and the index of the cow, and the remaining elements are the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, `x` is a list of integers where the first two elements are the number of cows and the index of the cow, and the remaining elements are the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, `ind` is a list containing the integer 1 (if the condition was not met) or the integers 1 and 2 (if the condition was met), `c` is 1 (if the condition was not met) or 2 (if the condition was met), `k` is an integer, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is greater than `x`, then `ind` contains the integers 1 and 2, and `c` is 2. Otherwise, `ind` contains the integer 1, and `c` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `a`, `x`, `ind`, `c`, `k`, `n`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state.
