Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between the difference of the first element of ind and 1, and the difference of k and the first element of ind.**

In this output state, the first element of ind is an index of an element in list a that is greater than x, and it is not equal to 0. Also, k is an integer that is less than or equal to the second element of ind. Therefore, the program returns the maximum value between the difference of this index and 1, and the difference of k and this index.
