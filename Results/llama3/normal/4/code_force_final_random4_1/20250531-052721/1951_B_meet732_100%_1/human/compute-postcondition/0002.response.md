Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers where the first element is the number of test cases, and each subsequent element is a list of integers where the first two elements are the number of cows and the index of the cow, and the remaining elements are the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, `x` is a list of integers where the first two elements are the number of cows and the index of the cow, and the remaining elements are the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, `ind` is an empty list, `c` is 0, `k` is an integer, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0. The current value of `a[i]` is greater than `x`.***
