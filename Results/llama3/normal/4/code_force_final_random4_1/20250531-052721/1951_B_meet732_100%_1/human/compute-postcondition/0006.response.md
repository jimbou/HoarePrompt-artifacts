Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where the first element is the number of test cases, and each subsequent element is a list of integers where the first two elements are the number of cows and the index of the cow, and the remaining elements are the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, `x` is a list of integers where the first two elements are the number of cows and the index of the cow, and the remaining elements are the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, `ind` is a list containing the value of `i` and `c` is 1, `k` is an integer, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `a`, `x`, `ind`, `c`, `k`, `n`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Note that the value of `c` is still 2, as it was in the initial state, and not 1, as it would be if the condition `a[i] > x` were true.
