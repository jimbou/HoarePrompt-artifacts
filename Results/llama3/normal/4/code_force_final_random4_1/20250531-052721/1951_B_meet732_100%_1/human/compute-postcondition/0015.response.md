Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers where the first element is the number of test cases, and each subsequent element is a list of integers where the first two elements are the number of cows and the index of the cow, and the remaining elements are the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, `x` is a list of integers where the first two elements are the number of cows and the index of the cow, and the remaining elements are the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, `ind` is a list containing the integer 1 (if the condition was not met) or the integers 1 and 2 (if the condition was met), `c` is 1 (if the condition was not met) or 2 (if the condition was met), `k` is an integer, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is greater than `x`, then `ind` contains the integers 1 and 2, and `c` is 2. Otherwise, `ind` contains the integer 1, and `c` is 1.***
