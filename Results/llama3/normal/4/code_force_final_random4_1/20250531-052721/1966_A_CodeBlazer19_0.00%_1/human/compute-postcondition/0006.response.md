Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, i is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, l is a list of integers, stdin contains t-3 test cases, and k-1 is printed**

The code executes two lines. The first line assigns the integer values of the next two inputs to `n` and `k`, respectively. Since `t` is an integer greater than 1, and there are `t-2` test cases in stdin, after reading two inputs, there are `t-3` test cases remaining in stdin. The second line assigns a list of integers from the next input to `l`. Since `k-1` is printed, the value of `k` is decremented by 1. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.
