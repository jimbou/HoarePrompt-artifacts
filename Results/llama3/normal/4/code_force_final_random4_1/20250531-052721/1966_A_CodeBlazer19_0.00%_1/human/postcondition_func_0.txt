This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains n integers. The function then prints k-1 for each test case, without modifying the input values. The function's purpose is to output a sequence of k-1 values, one for each test case, based on the input provided.
