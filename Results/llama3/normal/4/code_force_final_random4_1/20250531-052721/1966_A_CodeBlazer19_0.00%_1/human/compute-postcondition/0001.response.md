According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and stdin contains `t-1` test cases. So for the loop to be executed, `t` must be greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.
State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains `t-1` test cases**
