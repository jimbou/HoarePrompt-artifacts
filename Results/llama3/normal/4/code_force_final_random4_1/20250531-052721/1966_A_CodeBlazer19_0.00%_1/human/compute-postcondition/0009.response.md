The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `t` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **t is an integer greater than 2, i is 2, n is an integer, k is an integer, l is a list of integers, stdin contains t-3 test cases, and k-1 is printed, where k-1 is an integer less than k**
