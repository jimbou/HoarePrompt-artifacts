The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains t test cases, and each test case contains two lines, the first line containing two integers n and k, and the second line containing n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n, the input() function will read the first integer from the first line of the first test case, which is the value of t.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 100, 2 <= k <= 100). The second line contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n (1 <= c_i <= 100).**
