Postcondition: ***cities is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is at least 2, prog_cities is a list of n-1 zeros. If i is greater than 0, the current value of back is the (i-1)th element of cities. If i is less than n - 1, the current value of forward is the (i+1)th element of cities. Otherwise, the current value of forward is 999999999999999999. The absolute difference between the current city and the forward city is greater than or equal to the absolute difference between the current city and the back city.***
