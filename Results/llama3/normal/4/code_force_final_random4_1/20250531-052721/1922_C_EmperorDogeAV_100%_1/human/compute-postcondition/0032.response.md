Output State: **cities is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a positive integer, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers. The ith element of prog_cities is 1 if the absolute difference between the (i+1)th element of cities and the ith element of cities is less than the absolute difference between the ith element of cities and the (i-1)th element of cities. Otherwise, the ith element of prog_cities is the absolute difference between the (i+1)th element of cities and the ith element of cities.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `cities` remains unchanged, the list `prog_cities` is populated with values based on the differences between consecutive elements in `cities`, and the value of `n` remains the same. Specifically, for each index `i` in `prog_cities`, if the absolute difference between the next element in `cities` and the current element is less than the absolute difference between the current element and the previous element, then the value at index `i` in `prog_cities` is 1. Otherwise, the value at index `i` in `prog_cities` is the absolute difference between the next element in `cities` and the current element.
