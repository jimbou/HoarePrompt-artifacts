To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the given state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for i in range(n - 1):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1. To execute the loop again, `i` must be less than `n - 1`. Therefore, we need to increment `i` by 1.

The state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **cities is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is at least 2, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers, i is the previous value of i plus 2, back is the (i-1)th element of cities, if i < n - 1, forward is the (i+1)th element of cities. Otherwise, forward is 999999999999999999. The ith element of prog_cities is 1 if the absolute difference between the (i+1)th element of cities and the ith element of cities is less than the absolute difference between the ith element of cities and the (i-1)th element of cities. Otherwise, the ith element of prog_cities is the absolute difference between the (i+1)th element of cities and the ith element of cities.**
