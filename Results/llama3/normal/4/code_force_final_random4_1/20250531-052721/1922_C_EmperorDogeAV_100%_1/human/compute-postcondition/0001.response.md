According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, cities is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a positive integer, prog_cities is a list of n-1 zeros does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 2 and `i` is 0.
State: **cities is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is at least 2, prog_cities is a list of n-1 zeros, i is 0**
