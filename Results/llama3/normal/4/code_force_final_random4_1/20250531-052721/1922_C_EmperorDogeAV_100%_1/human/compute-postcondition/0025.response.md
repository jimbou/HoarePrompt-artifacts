Output State: **cities is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is at least 2, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers, i is the previous value of i plus 2, back is the (i-1)th element of cities, forward is 999999999999999999.**

In this output state, the value of `back` has been updated to be the (i-1)th element of the list `cities`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still the previous value of `i` plus 2, and the lists `cities` and `prog_cities` are still the same. The value of `forward` is still 999999999999999999.
