Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum number of coins needed to travel between cities.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program correctly reads the input and initializes the necessary variables.
2.  The `func_1` function correctly calculates the closest city for each city and returns a list of integers representing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the input list. If the difference between the current element and the next element is less than the difference between the current element and the previous element, the function returns 1 for that position.
3.  The program correctly calculates the prefix sum arrays `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` using the output of the `func_1` function.
4.  The program correctly handles the queries by calculating the minimum number of coins needed to travel between cities using the prefix sum arrays.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem, and its execution summary matches the expected behavior.

Correctness: **True**
