Output State: **cities is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a positive integer, prog_cities is a list of n-1 zeros**

In this output state, the list `prog_cities` has been created with `n-1` zeros, where `n` is the number of elements in the list `cities`. The list `cities` and the variable `n` remain unchanged.
