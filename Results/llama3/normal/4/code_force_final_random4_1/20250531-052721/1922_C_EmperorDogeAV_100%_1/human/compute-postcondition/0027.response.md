Output State: **cities is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is at least 2, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers. If i is larger than 0, i is the previous value of i plus 2, back is the (i-1)th element of cities, and forward is the (i+1)th element of cities. If i is not larger than 0, the values of i, back, and forward remain unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of forward has been updated to be the (i+1)th element of cities, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The list cities and prog_cities are still the same, and the conditions for i, back, and forward are still dependent on whether i is larger than 0 or not.
