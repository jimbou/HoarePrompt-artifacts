Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of coins needed to travel from one city to another.

The function `func_1` calculates the minimum cost to travel from each city to the next city. If the next city is closer than the previous city, the cost is 1, otherwise, the cost is the absolute difference between the two cities.

The program then calculates the prefix sum of these costs in both forward and backward directions. This allows it to calculate the minimum cost to travel from any city to any other city in O(1) time.

The main part of the program reads the input, calls `func_1` to calculate the costs, and then reads the queries and prints the minimum cost to travel from one city to another.

The program correctly handles the case where the two cities are in the same direction (i.e., `a < b` or `a > b`) and uses the corresponding prefix sum to calculate the minimum cost.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
