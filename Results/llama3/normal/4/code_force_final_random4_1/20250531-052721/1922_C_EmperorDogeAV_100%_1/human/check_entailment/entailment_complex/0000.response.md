Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of coins needed to travel between cities. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum cost to travel to the next city, which is either 1 if the next city is closer than the previous city, or the absolute difference between the current city and the next city.

The main program correctly calculates the prefix sums of the forward and backward costs, and uses these prefix sums to calculate the minimum cost to travel between any two cities.

The program also correctly handles the case where the source city is greater than the destination city, by using the backward prefix sum.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
