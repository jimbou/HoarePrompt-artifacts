Output State: **cities is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is at least 2, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers, i is the previous value of i plus 1, back is the (i-1)th element of cities, forward is the (i+1)th element of cities.**

In this output state, the value of `forward` has been updated to be the (i+1)th element of `cities`, which is a distinct non-negative integer in ascending order. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
