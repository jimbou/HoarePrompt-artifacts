Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: cities is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a positive integer, prog_cities is a list of n-1 zeros
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    back = -99999999999999999999
    forward = 999999999999999999
    if i > 0:
        back = cities[i - 1]
    if i < n - 1:
        forward = cities[i + 1]
    if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
        prog_cities[i] = 1
    else:
        prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *cities is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is at least 2, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers. If the absolute difference between the (i+1)th element of cities and the ith element of cities is less than the absolute difference between the ith element of cities and the (i-1)th element of cities, then the ith element of prog_cities is 1 and the rest are zeros. Otherwise, the ith element of prog_cities is the absolute difference between the (i+1)th element of cities and the ith element of cities. If i is greater than 0, the current value of back is the (i-1)th element of cities. If i is less than n - 1, the current value of forward is the (i+1)th element of cities. Otherwise, the current value of forward is 999999999999999999.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *cities is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is at least 2, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers, i is the previous value of i plus 1, back is the (i-1)th element of cities, if i < n - 1, forward is the (i+1)th element of cities. Otherwise, forward is 999999999999999999. The ith element of prog_cities is 1 if the absolute difference between the (i+1)th element of cities and the ith element of cities is less than the absolute difference between the ith element of cities and the (i-1)th element of cities. Otherwise, the ith element of prog_cities is the absolute difference between the (i+1)th element of cities and the ith element of cities.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *cities is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is at least 2, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers. If i is larger than 0 and i is less than n-1, i is the previous value of i plus 2, back is the (i-1)th element of cities, and forward is the (i+1)th element of cities. If i is not larger than 0 or i is not less than n-1, the values of i, back, and forward remain unchanged. If the absolute difference between the (i+1)th and ith elements of cities is less than the absolute difference between the ith and (i-1)th elements of cities, the ith element of prog_cities is 1. Otherwise, the ith element of prog_cities is the absolute difference between the (i+1)th and ith elements of cities.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
