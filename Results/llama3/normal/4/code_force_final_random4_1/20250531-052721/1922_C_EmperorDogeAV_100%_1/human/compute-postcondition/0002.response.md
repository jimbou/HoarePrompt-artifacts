The code snippet assigns two new variables, `back` and `forward`, with extremely large negative and positive values, respectively. These assignments do not affect the existing variables `cities`, `prog_cities`, and `i`.

Output State: **cities is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is at least 2, prog_cities is a list of n-1 zeros, i is 0, back is -99999999999999999999, forward is 999999999999999999**
