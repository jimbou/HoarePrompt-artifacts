Functionality: This function takes a list of distinct non-negative integers in ascending order and returns a list of integers representing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the input list. If the difference between the current element and the next element is less than the difference between the current element and the previous element, the function returns 1 for that position. The function processes each element in the input list, except the first and last elements, and generates a corresponding output list with one less element than the input list.
