Postcondition: ***cities is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is at least 2, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers, i is the previous value of i plus 1, back is the (i-1)th element of cities, if i < n - 1, forward is the (i+1)th element of cities. Otherwise, forward is 999999999999999999. The ith element of prog_cities is 1 if the absolute difference between the (i+1)th element of cities and the ith element of cities is less than the absolute difference between the ith element of cities and the (i-1)th element of cities. Otherwise, the ith element of prog_cities is the absolute difference between the (i+1)th element of cities and the ith element of cities.***
