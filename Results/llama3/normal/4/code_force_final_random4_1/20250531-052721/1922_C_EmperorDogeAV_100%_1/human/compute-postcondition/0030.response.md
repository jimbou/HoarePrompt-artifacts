Output State: **`cities` is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 integers, where the ith element is the absolute difference between the (i+1)th and ith elements of `cities` if i is larger than 0 and less than n-1, otherwise it remains unchanged, `i` is either larger than 0 and less than n-1, or it remains unchanged, `back` is the (i-1)th element of `cities` if i is larger than 0 and less than n-1, otherwise it remains unchanged, and `forward` is the (i+1)th element of `cities` if i is larger than 0 and less than n-1, otherwise it remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is that the `prog_cities` list is updated with the absolute difference between consecutive elements in the `cities` list, but only for indices that are larger than 0 and less than n-1. The values of `i`, `back`, and `forward` remain unchanged if `i` is not within this range. The `cities` list remains unchanged.
