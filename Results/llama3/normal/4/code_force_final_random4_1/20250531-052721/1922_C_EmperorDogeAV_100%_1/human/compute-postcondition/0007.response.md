Output State: **cities is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is at least 2, prog_cities is a list of n-1 zeros. If i is greater than 0, the current value of back is the (i-1)th element of cities and the current value of forward is the (i+1)th element of cities. The current value of i is less than n - 1.**

In this output state, the value of `forward` has been updated to the (i+1)th element of `cities`, which is a distinct non-negative integer. The values of the other variables remain the same. The list `cities` is still in ascending order, and `prog_cities` is still a list of n-1 zeros. The relationship between `back`, `forward`, and `i` has been updated to reflect the new value of `forward`.
