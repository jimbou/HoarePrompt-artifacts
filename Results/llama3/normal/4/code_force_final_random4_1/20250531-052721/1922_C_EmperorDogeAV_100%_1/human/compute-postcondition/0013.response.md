Postcondition: ***cities is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is at least 2, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers. If the absolute difference between the (i+1)th element of cities and the ith element of cities is less than the absolute difference between the ith element of cities and the (i-1)th element of cities, then the ith element of prog_cities is 1 and the rest are zeros. Otherwise, the ith element of prog_cities is the absolute difference between the (i+1)th element of cities and the ith element of cities. If i is greater than 0, the current value of back is the (i-1)th element of cities. If i is less than n - 1, the current value of forward is the (i+1)th element of cities. Otherwise, the current value of forward is 999999999999999999.***
