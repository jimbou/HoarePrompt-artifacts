Output State: **cities is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is at least 2, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers, i is the previous value of i plus 2, back is -99999999999999999999, forward is 999999999999999999.**

The code snippet assigns new values to the variables `back` and `forward`, which were previously dependent on the value of `i` and the elements of the `cities` list. After executing the code, `back` is set to a very large negative number (-99999999999999999999) and `forward` is set to a very large positive number (999999999999999999). The values of `cities`, `n`, `prog_cities`, and `i` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code.
