Output State: **cities is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is at least 2, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers where the ith element is 1, if i is larger than 0 and i is less than n-1, i is the previous value of i plus 2, back is the (i-1)th element of cities, and forward is the (i+1)th element of cities. If i is not larger than 0 or i is not less than n-1, the values of i, back, and forward remain unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of prog_cities[i] has been updated to 1. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The list cities is still a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, and n is still at least 2. The value of i, back, and forward also remain unchanged if i is not larger than 0 or i is not less than n-1.
