Output State: **cities is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is at least 2, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers where the ith element is the absolute difference between the (i+1)th element of cities and the ith element of cities, i is the previous value of i plus 1, back is the (i-1)th element of cities, if i < n - 1, forward is the (i+1)th element of cities. Otherwise, forward is 999999999999999999**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of cities remains the same, the list of progressive cities is updated with the absolute difference between the next city and the current city at the ith position, the value of i is incremented by 1, the value of back remains the same as the previous city, and the value of forward remains the same as the next city if it exists, otherwise it remains a very large number.
