Output State: **`cities` is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 integers where the ith element is the absolute difference between the (i+1)th element of `cities` and the ith element of `cities`, `back` is the (i-1)th element of `cities` if i is greater than 0, `forward` is the (i+1)th element of `cities` if i is less than n - 1, otherwise `forward` is 999999999999999999, and the absolute difference between the current city and the forward city is greater than or equal to the absolute difference between the current city and the back city.**

In this output state, the list `prog_cities` has been updated to store the absolute differences between consecutive cities in the `cities` list. The values of `back` and `forward` remain the same as in the initial state, and the condition regarding the absolute differences between the current city and its neighboring cities still holds.
