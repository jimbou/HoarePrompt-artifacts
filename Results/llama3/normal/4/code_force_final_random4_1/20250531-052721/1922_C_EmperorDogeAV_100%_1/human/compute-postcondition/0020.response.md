Output State: **cities is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is at least 2, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers where the ith element is 1, i is the previous value of i plus 1, back is the (i-1)th element of cities, if i < n - 1, forward is the (i+1)th element of cities. Otherwise, forward is 999999999999999999**

In this output state, the value of prog_cities[i] has been updated to 1. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The list prog_cities now has the ith element as 1, while the other elements remain unchanged. The rest of the variables, including cities, n, i, back, and forward, retain their original values and properties.
