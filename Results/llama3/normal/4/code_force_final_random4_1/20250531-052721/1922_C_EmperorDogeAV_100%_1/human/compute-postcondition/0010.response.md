Output State: **cities is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is at least 2, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers where the ith element is 1 and the rest are zeros, if i is greater than 0, the current value of back is the (i-1)th element of cities. If i is less than n - 1, the current value of forward is the (i+1)th element of cities. Otherwise, the current value of forward is 999999999999999999. The absolute difference between forward and the ith element of cities is less than the absolute difference between the ith element of cities and back.**

In this output state, the only change is that the ith element of prog_cities is now 1, while the rest of the elements remain zeros. The values of the other variables, including cities, back, and forward, remain the same as in the initial state. The conditions regarding the relationships between these variables also remain unchanged.
