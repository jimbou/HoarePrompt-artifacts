Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement. It correctly calculates the minimum number of coins needed to travel between two cities by considering the closest city to each city and the distance between them.

The program first calculates the closest city to each city in both the forward and backward directions using the `func_1` function. It then calculates the prefix sum of the distances between the cities in both directions.

When a query is made, the program checks if the destination city is to the right or left of the source city. If it's to the right, it calculates the minimum number of coins needed by subtracting the prefix sum of the source city from the prefix sum of the destination city. If it's to the left, it does the same but with the backward prefix sum.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including when the source and destination cities are the same, and when the destination city is the closest city to the source city.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
