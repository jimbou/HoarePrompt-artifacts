To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is some value, and `n` is at least 2.

To adjust the states, we need to increment `i` by 1, so that it is now equal to the previous value of `i` plus 1. We also need to ensure that `n` is still at least 2, but since `n` is not changed by the loop, its value remains the same.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `cities` is still a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order
* `n` is still at least 2
* `prog_cities` is still a list of n-1 integers
* `i` is now equal to the previous value of `i` plus 1
* `back` is now the ith element of cities (since i is greater than 0)
* `forward` is now the (i+1)th element of cities (since i is less than n - 1)

State: **cities is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is at least 2, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers, i is the previous value of i plus 1, back is the ith element of cities, forward is the (i+1)th element of cities**
