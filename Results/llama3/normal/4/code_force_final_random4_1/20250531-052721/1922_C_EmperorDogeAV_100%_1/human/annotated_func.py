    #State: cities is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a positive integer, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers. The ith element of prog_cities is 1 if the absolute difference between the (i+1)th element of cities and the ith element of cities is less than the absolute difference between the ith element of cities and the (i-1)th element of cities. Otherwise, the ith element of prog_cities is the absolute difference between the (i+1)th element of cities and the ith element of cities.
    return prog_cities
    #The program returns a list of n-1 integers, where each integer represents the absolute difference between consecutive elements in the list 'cities', or 1 if the difference between the current element and the next element is less than the difference between the current element and the previous element.

#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: This function takes a list of distinct non-negative integers in ascending order and returns a list of integers representing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the input list. If the difference between the current element and the next element is less than the difference between the current element and the previous element, the function returns 1 for that position. The function processes each element in the input list, except the first and last elements, and generates a corresponding output list with one less element than the input list.
