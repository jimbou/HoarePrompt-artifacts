Output State: **cities is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is at least 2, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers, i is the previous value of i plus 1, back is -99999999999999999999, forward is 999999999999999999**

The code snippet modifies the values of the variables `back` and `forward`. The first line assigns a very large negative number to `back`, and the second line assigns a very large positive number to `forward`. The values of `cities`, `prog_cities`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
