Postcondition: ***cities is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is at least 2, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers. If i is larger than 0 and i is less than n-1, i is the previous value of i plus 2, back is the (i-1)th element of cities, and forward is the (i+1)th element of cities. If i is not larger than 0 or i is not less than n-1, the values of i, back, and forward remain unchanged. If the absolute difference between the (i+1)th and ith elements of cities is less than the absolute difference between the ith and (i-1)th elements of cities, the ith element of prog_cities is 1. Otherwise, the ith element of prog_cities is the absolute difference between the (i+1)th and ith elements of cities.***
