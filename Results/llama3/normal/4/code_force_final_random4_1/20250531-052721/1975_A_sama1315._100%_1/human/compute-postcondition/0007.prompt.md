Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: data is an empty list, idx is 1, t is an integer, results is an empty list, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
    idx += n
    result = func_1(a)
    results.append(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: data is an empty list, idx is 1 + n + 1, t is greater than 0, results is a list containing the result of func_1(a), stdin is empty, _ is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: data is an empty list, idx is 2 + n + 1, t is greater than 1, results is a list containing the result of func_1(a) and the result of func_1(a) with the new value of a, _ is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: data is an empty list, idx is 2 + n + 1 + n, t is greater than 2, results is a list containing the result of func_1(a), the result of func_1(a) with the new value of a, and the result of func_1(a) with the new value of a, _ is 2, n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, result is the result of func_1(a)




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
