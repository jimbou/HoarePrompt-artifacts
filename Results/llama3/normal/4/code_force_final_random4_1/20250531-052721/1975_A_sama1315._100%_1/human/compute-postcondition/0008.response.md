The code prints the elements of the `results` list, which contains the results of `func_1(a)` for each iteration of the loop, joined by newline characters.
Since the initial state of `results` is not explicitly provided, we can't determine the exact values in the list. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the results of `func_1(a)` for each iteration of the loop, separated by newline characters.
Output: **the results of func_1(a) for each iteration of the loop, separated by newline characters**
