Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether a given array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by swapping its prefix and suffix. The program uses a helper function `func_1` to check if the array can be sorted.

In `func_1`, the program first sorts the input array `a` and concatenates it with itself to create a new list `concatenated_a`. Then, it checks if any sublist of `concatenated_a` with the same length as `a` is equal to the sorted array `sorted_a`. If such a sublist is found, the program returns 'Yes', indicating that the array can be sorted. If no such sublist is found after checking all possible sublists, the program returns 'No'.

The main function `func_2` reads input from the standard input, parses it into a list of integers, and calls `func_1` for each test case. The results are stored in a list and printed out at the end.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. Therefore,

Correctness: **True**
