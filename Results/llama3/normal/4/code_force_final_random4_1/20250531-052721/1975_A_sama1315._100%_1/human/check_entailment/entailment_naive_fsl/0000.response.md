Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program is correct because it checks all possible rotations of the input array and verifies if any of them is sorted in non-decreasing order. The function `func_1` concatenates the input array with itself, which allows it to simulate the rotation operation. It then checks if any substring of the concatenated array is equal to the sorted version of the input array. If such a substring is found, it means that the input array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by rotating it.

The program handles all possible cases, including:

* Arrays that are already sorted in non-decreasing order
* Arrays that can be sorted in non-decreasing order by rotating them
* Arrays that cannot be sorted in non-decreasing order by rotating them

The program also handles edge cases, such as arrays with only one element or arrays with all elements being equal.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, therefore I conclude that the program is correct.
