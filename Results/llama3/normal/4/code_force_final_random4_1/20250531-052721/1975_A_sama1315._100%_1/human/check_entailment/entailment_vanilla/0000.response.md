Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if a given array can be sorted in non-decreasing order after performing a specific operation some number of times. The operation involves splitting the array into two parts, a prefix and a suffix, and then swapping these two parts.

Function 1, `func_1(a)`, takes an array `a` as input and checks if it can be sorted in non-decreasing order after performing the operation. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the function:

1. It calculates the length of the array `n` and creates a sorted version of the array `sorted_a`.
2. It concatenates the original array with itself to create a new array `concatenated_a`. This is done to simulate the operation of splitting the array into two parts and swapping them.
3. It then iterates over the `concatenated_a` array, checking if any subarray of length `n` (i.e., the original array length) is equal to the sorted array `sorted_a`. If it finds such a subarray, it returns 'Yes', indicating that the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order after performing the operation.
4. If no such subarray is found after iterating over the entire `concatenated_a` array, it returns 'No', indicating that the array cannot be sorted in non-decreasing order after performing the operation.

Function 2, `func_2()`, reads input from the standard input, processes it, and calls Function 1 for each test case. It then prints the results.

Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the required logic to solve the problem. It checks all possible subarrays of the concatenated array to see if any of them match the sorted array, which is the correct approach to solve this problem.

Correctness: **True**
