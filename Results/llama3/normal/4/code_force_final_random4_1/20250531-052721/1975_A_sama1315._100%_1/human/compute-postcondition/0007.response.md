Output State: **data is an empty list, idx is 1 + t*n + t, t is 0, results is a list containing the result of func_1(a) for each iteration of the loop, stdin is empty, _ is t-1**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the data list remains empty, the index idx has moved forward by the total number of elements processed (t*n) plus the number of iterations (t), the variable t is now 0, the results list contains the results of func_1(a) for each iteration of the loop, the stdin remains empty, and the loop variable _ is now t-1.
