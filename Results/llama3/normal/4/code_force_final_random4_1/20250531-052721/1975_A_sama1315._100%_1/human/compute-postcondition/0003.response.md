The only variable in the loop head is variable _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t. If _ is less than t, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 0, t is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again _ must be 1 and t must be greater than 1.
State: **data is an empty list, idx is 1 + n + 1, t is greater than 1, results is a list containing the result of func_1(a), stdin is empty, _ is 1**
