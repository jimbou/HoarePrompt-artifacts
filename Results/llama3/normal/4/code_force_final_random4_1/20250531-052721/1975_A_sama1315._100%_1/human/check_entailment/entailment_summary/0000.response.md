Reasoning: 

The problem requires determining if a given array can become sorted in non-decreasing order after performing a specific operation some number of times. The operation involves splitting the array into two parts, a prefix and a suffix, and then swapping these two parts.

Function `func_1` checks if a sorted version of the input list can be found as a contiguous sublist within the list concatenated with itself. This is a correct approach to solve the problem, as it effectively checks if the array can be sorted by swapping its prefix and suffix.

Function `func_2` reads input from standard input, parses it into a list of integers and space-separated lists of integers, applies the `func_1` function to each list of integers, and prints the results separated by newline characters. This function is responsible for handling the input/output operations and calling `func_1` for each test case.

Since `func_1` correctly solves the problem and `func_2` correctly handles the input/output operations and calls `func_1`, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
