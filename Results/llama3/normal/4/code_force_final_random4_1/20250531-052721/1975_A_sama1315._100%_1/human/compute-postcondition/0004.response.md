Output State: **data is an empty list, idx is 2 + n + 1, t is greater than 1, results is a list containing the result of func_1(a) and the result of func_1(a) with the new value of a, _ is 1**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

After executing the code, the list `data` remains empty. The variable `idx` is incremented by `n + 1`, so its new value is `2 + n + 1`. The value of `t` is still greater than 1. The list `results` now contains two elements: the original result of `func_1(a)` and the new result of `func_1(a)` with the updated value of `a`. The variable `_` remains unchanged with a value of 1.
