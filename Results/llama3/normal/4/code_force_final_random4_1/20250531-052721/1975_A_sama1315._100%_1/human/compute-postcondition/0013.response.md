Functionality: **This function checks if a sorted version of the input list can be found as a contiguous sublist within the list concatenated with itself. It returns 'Yes' if such a sublist exists, and 'No' otherwise. The function accepts a list of positive integers as input and returns a string indicating the presence or absence of the sorted sublist.**
