Output State: **data is an empty list, idx is 1 + n + 1, t is greater than 0, results is a list containing the result of func_1(a), stdin is empty, _ is 0**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

After executing the code block, the state of the program is as follows: The list `data` remains empty. The index `idx` has been incremented by `n + 1`, where `n` is the value of the integer at index `idx` in the `data` list. The value of `t` is still greater than 0, as it was not modified by the code. The list `results` now contains one element, which is the result of calling the function `func_1` with the list `a` as an argument. The list `a` was created by mapping the integers from the `data` list starting from index `idx` to `idx + n`. The standard input `stdin` is still empty, and the variable `_` remains 0.
