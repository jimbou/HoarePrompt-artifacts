The only variables in the loop head are variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, data is an empty list, idx is 1, stdin is empty, results is an empty list does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and `_` is now 0.
State: **`data` is an empty list, `idx` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `stdin` is empty, `_` is 0**
