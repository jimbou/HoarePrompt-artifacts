Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `result` is a list containing either `screen_require_for_y` or the sum of `extra_screen` and `screen_require_for_y`, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `space_x` is an integer equal to the new value of `x`, `space_y` is an integer equal to 4 times the new value of `y`, `total_space` is an integer equal to 5 times the new value of `y` plus the new value of `x`, `_` is 2, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer equal to `y` divided by 2, `remaining_cells` is an integer equal to 15 times `y` divided by 2 minus 4 times `y`, `stdin` contains t-6 inputs: t-6 pairs of integers `x` and `y`. If `y` is even, `remaining_cells` is an integer equal to 15 times `y` divided by 2 minus 4 times `y`. If `y` is odd, `remaining_cells` is an integer equal to 15 times (`y` // 2 + 1) minus 4 times `y`. `remaining_cells` is also equal to 15 times `screen_require_for_y` minus `space_y`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, then `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`. Otherwise, `extra_space` is an integer equal to `space_x` minus `remaining_cells`. If `space_x` is a multiple of 15, `extra_screen` is an integer equal to `space_x` divided by 15. If `space_x` is not a multiple of 15, `extra_screen` is an integer equal to `extra_space` divided by 15 plus 1. In all cases, `space_x` is either less than or equal to `remaining_cells` or more than `remaining_cells`.**

In this output state, the value of `screen_require_for_y` has been updated to `y // 2`, which is the integer division of `y` by 2. The value of `remaining_cells` has also been updated to `15 * (y // 2) - 4 * y`, which is 15 times the new value of `screen_require_for_y` minus 4 times `y`. The other variables remain unchanged.
