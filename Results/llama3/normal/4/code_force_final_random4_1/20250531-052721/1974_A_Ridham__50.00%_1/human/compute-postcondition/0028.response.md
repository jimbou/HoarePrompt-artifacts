Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `result` is a list containing either `screen_require_for_y` or the sum of `extra_screen` and `screen_require_for_y`, `stdin` contains t-3 inputs: t-3 pairs of integers x and y, `_` is 1, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `space_x` is an integer equal to the new value of x, `space_y` is an integer equal to 4 times the new value of y, `total_space` is an integer equal to 5 times the new value of y plus the new value of x. If y is even, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer equal to y divided by 2 and `remaining_cells` is an integer equal to 15 times y divided by 2 minus 4 times y. If y is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer equal to y // 2 + 1 and `remaining_cells` is an integer equal to 15 times (y // 2 + 1) minus 4 times y. `remaining_cells` is also equal to 15 times `screen_require_for_y` minus `space_y`. `extra_space` is an integer equal to `space_x` minus `remaining_cells`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, then `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`. Otherwise, `extra_space` is an integer equal to `space_x` minus `remaining_cells`. `extra_screen` is an integer equal to `space_x` divided by 15. `space_x` is either less than or equal to `remaining_cells` or more than `remaining_cells`.**

In this output state, the value of `extra_screen` has been updated to be equal to `space_x` divided by 15. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `extra_screen` is now a specific integer value, which is the result of dividing `space_x` by 15. The rest of the variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
