The only variable in the loop head is variable  `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **n is at least 3, result is a list containing either screen_require_for_y or the sum of extra_screen and screen_require_for_y. stdin contains t-5 inputs: t-5 pairs of integers x and y, _ is 2, x is an integer, y is an integer, space_x is an integer equal to the new value of x, space_y is an integer equal to 4 times the new value of y, total_space is an integer equal to 5 times the new value of y plus the new value of x. If y is even, screen_require_for_y is an integer equal to y divided by 2 and remaining_cells is an integer equal to 15 times y divided by 2 minus 4 times y. If y is odd, screen_require_for_y is an integer equal to y // 2 + 1 and remaining_cells is an integer equal to 15 times (y // 2 + 1) minus 4 times y. remaining_cells is also equal to 15 times screen_require_for_y minus space_y. If space_x is less than or equal to remaining_cells, then space_x is less than or equal to remaining_cells. Otherwise, extra_space is an integer equal to space_x minus remaining_cells. If space_x is a multiple of 15, extra_screen is an integer equal to space_x divided by 15. If space_x is not a multiple of 15, extra_screen is an integer equal to extra_space divided by 15 plus 1. In all cases, space_x is either less than or equal to remaining_cells or more than remaining_cells.**
