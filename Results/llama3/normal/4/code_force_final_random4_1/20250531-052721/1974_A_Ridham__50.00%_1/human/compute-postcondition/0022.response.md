Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `result` is a list containing either `screen_require_for_y` or the sum of `extra_screen` and `screen_require_for_y`, `stdin` contains t-3 inputs: t-3 pairs of integers `x` and `y`, `_` is 1, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `space_x` is an integer equal to the new value of `x`, `space_y` is an integer equal to 4 times the new value of `y`, `total_space` is an integer equal to 5 times the new value of `y` plus the new value of `x`, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer equal to the new value of `y` divided by 2, `remaining_cells` is an integer equal to 15 times the new value of `y` divided by 2 minus 4 times the new value of `y`, if `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, then `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, otherwise `extra_space` is an integer equal to `space_x` minus `remaining_cells`, if `space_x` is a multiple of 15, `extra_screen` is an integer equal to `space_x` divided by 15, if `space_x` is not a multiple of 15, `extra_screen` is an integer equal to `extra_space` divided by 15 plus 1, in all cases, `space_x` is either less than or equal to `remaining_cells` or more than `remaining_cells`.**

In this output state, the value of `screen_require_for_y` has been updated to be equal to the new value of `y` divided by 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that the value of `y` is not specified, so `screen_require_for_y` is expressed in terms of `y`.
