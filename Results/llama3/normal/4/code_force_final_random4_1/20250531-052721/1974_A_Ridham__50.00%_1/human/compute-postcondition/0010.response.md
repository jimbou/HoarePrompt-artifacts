Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `result` is a list containing `screen_require_for_y`, stdin contains t-1 inputs: t-1 pairs of integers x and y, `_` is 0, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `space_x` is an integer equal to `x`, `space_y` is an integer equal to 4 times `y`, `total_space` is an integer equal to 5 times `y` plus `x`. If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer equal to `y` divided by 2 and `remaining_cells` is an integer equal to 15 times `y` divided by 2 minus 4 times `y`. If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer equal to `y` // 2 + 1 and `remaining_cells` is an integer equal to 15 times (`y` // 2 + 1) minus 4 times `y`. The current value of `space_x` is less than or equal to the current value of `remaining_cells`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `screen_require_for_y` has been appended to the `result` list. The other variables remain unchanged. The `result` list now contains the value of `screen_require_for_y`, which is either `y` divided by 2 (if `y` is even) or `y` // 2 + 1 (if `y` is odd). The rest of the variables retain their original values and relationships.
