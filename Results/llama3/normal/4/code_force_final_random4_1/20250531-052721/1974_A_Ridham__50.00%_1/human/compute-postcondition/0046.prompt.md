Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, result is an empty list, stdin contains t inputs: t pairs of integers x and y
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
    space_x = x * 1
    space_y = y * 4
    total_space = space_y + space_x
    if y % 2 == 0:
        screen_require_for_y = y // 2
    else:
        screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1
    remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y
    if space_x <= remaining_cells:
        result.append(screen_require_for_y)
    else:
        extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells
        if space_x % 15 == 0:
            extra_screen = space_x // 15
        else:
            extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1
        result.append(extra_screen + screen_require_for_y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is at least 1, `result` is a list containing either `screen_require_for_y` or the sum of `extra_screen` and `screen_require_for_y`, stdin contains t-1 inputs: t-1 pairs of integers x and y, `_` is 0, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `space_x` is an integer equal to `x`, `space_y` is an integer equal to 4 times `y`, `total_space` is an integer equal to 5 times `y` plus `x`. If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer equal to `y` divided by 2 and `remaining_cells` is an integer equal to 15 times `y` divided by 2 minus 4 times `y`. If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer equal to `y` // 2 + 1 and `remaining_cells` is an integer equal to 15 times (`y` // 2 + 1) minus 4 times `y`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, then `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`. Otherwise, `extra_space` is an integer equal to `space_x` minus `remaining_cells`. If `space_x` is a multiple of 15, `extra_screen` is an integer equal to `space_x` divided by 15. If `space_x` is not a multiple of 15, `extra_screen` is an integer equal to `extra_space` divided by 15 plus 1. In all cases, `space_x` is either less than or equal to `remaining_cells` or more than `remaining_cells`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is at least 2, result is a list containing either screen_require_for_y or the sum of extra_screen and screen_require_for_y. stdin contains t-4 inputs: t-4 pairs of integers x and y, _ is 1, x is an integer, y is an integer, space_x is an integer equal to the new value of x, space_y is an integer equal to 4 times the new value of y, total_space is an integer equal to 5 times the new value of y plus the new value of x. If y is even, screen_require_for_y is an integer equal to y divided by 2 and remaining_cells is an integer equal to 15 times y divided by 2 minus 4 times y. If y is odd, screen_require_for_y is an integer equal to y // 2 + 1 and remaining_cells is an integer equal to 15 times (y // 2 + 1) minus 4 times y. remaining_cells is also equal to 15 times screen_require_for_y minus space_y. If space_x is less than or equal to remaining_cells, then space_x is less than or equal to remaining_cells. Otherwise, extra_space is an integer equal to space_x minus remaining_cells. If space_x is a multiple of 15, extra_screen is an integer equal to space_x divided by 15. If space_x is not a multiple of 15, extra_screen is an integer equal to extra_space divided by 15 plus 1. In all cases, space_x is either less than or equal to remaining_cells or more than remaining_cells.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is at least 3, `result` is a list containing either `screen_require_for_y` or the sum of `extra_screen` and `screen_require_for_y`, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `space_x` is an integer equal to the new value of `x`, `space_y` is an integer equal to 4 times the new value of `y`, `total_space` is an integer equal to 5 times the new value of `y` plus the new value of `x`, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains t-7 inputs: t-7 pairs of integers `x` and `y`, `remaining_cells` is an integer equal to 15 times `screen_require_for_y` minus `space_y`, and if `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer equal to `y` divided by 2 and `remaining_cells` is an integer equal to 15 times `y` divided by 2 minus 4 times `y`. If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer equal to `y // 2 + 1` and `remaining_cells` is an integer equal to 15 times (`y // 2 + 1`) minus 4 times `y`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, then `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`. Otherwise, `extra_space` is an integer equal to `space_x` minus `remaining_cells`. If `space_x` is a multiple of 15, `extra_screen` is an integer equal to `space_x` divided by 15. If `space_x` is not a multiple of 15, `extra_screen` is an integer equal to `extra_space` divided by 15 plus 1. In all cases, `space_x` is either less than or equal to `remaining_cells` or more than `remaining_cells`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
