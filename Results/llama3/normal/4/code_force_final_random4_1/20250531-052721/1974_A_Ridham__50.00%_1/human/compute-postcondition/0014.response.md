Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `result` is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 inputs: t-1 pairs of integers x and y, `_` is 0, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `space_x` is an integer equal to `x`, `space_y` is an integer equal to 4 times `y`, `total_space` is an integer equal to 5 times `y` plus `x`. If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer equal to `y` divided by 2 and `remaining_cells` is an integer equal to 15 times `y` divided by 2 minus 4 times `y`. If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer equal to `y` // 2 + 1 and `remaining_cells` is an integer equal to 15 times (`y` // 2 + 1) minus 4 times `y`. `extra_space` is an integer equal to `space_x` minus `remaining_cells`, `extra_screen` is an integer equal to `space_x` divided by 15, and `space_x` is more than `remaining_cells`. The current value of `space_x` is a multiple of 15.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `extra_screen` which is equal to `space_x` divided by 15. The value of `extra_screen` is an integer because `space_x` is a multiple of 15. All other variables remain unchanged.
