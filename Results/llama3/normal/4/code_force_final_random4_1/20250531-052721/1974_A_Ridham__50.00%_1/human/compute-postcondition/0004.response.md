Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `result` is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 inputs: t-1 pairs of integers x and y, `_` is 0, `x` is an integer, `y` is an even integer, `space_x` is an integer equal to x, `space_y` is an integer equal to 4 times y, `total_space` is an integer equal to 5 times y plus x, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer equal to y divided by 2.**

In this output state, the value of `screen_require_for_y` has been calculated as `y` divided by 2, since `y` is an even integer. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains t-1 pairs of integers x and y.
