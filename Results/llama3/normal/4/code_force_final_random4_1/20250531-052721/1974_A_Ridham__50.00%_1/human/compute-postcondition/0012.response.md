Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `result` is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 inputs: t-1 pairs of integers x and y, `_` is 0, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `space_x` is an integer equal to `x`, `space_y` is an integer equal to 4 times `y`, `total_space` is an integer equal to 5 times `y` plus `x`. If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer equal to `y` divided by 2 and `remaining_cells` is an integer equal to 15 times `y` divided by 2 minus 4 times `y`. If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer equal to `y` // 2 + 1 and `remaining_cells` is an integer equal to 15 times (`y` // 2 + 1) minus 4 times `y`. `extra_space` is an integer equal to `space_x` minus `remaining_cells`, and `space_x` is more than `remaining_cells`.**

In this output state, the value of `extra_space` is calculated as the difference between `space_x` and `remaining_cells`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `extra_space` is a specific integer value that is equal to `space_x` minus `remaining_cells`. The relationship between `space_x` and `remaining_cells` is maintained, with `space_x` being more than `remaining_cells`.
