Output: **`n` is 0, `result` is a list containing either `screen_require_for_y` or the sum of `extra_screen` and `screen_require_for_y` for each pair of integers `x` and `y` in `stdin`, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `space_x` is an integer equal to the last value of `x`, `space_y` is an integer equal to 4 times the last value of `y`, `total_space` is an integer equal to 5 times the last value of `y` plus the last value of `x`, `_` is `n`, `stdin` is empty, `remaining_cells` is an integer equal to 15 times `screen_require_for_y` minus `space_y`, and if `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer equal to `y` divided by 2 and `remaining_cells` is an integer equal to 15 times `y` divided by 2 minus 4 times `y`. If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer equal to `y // 2 + 1` and `remaining_cells` is an integer equal to 15 times (`y // 2 + 1`) minus 4 times `y`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, then `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`. Otherwise, `extra_space` is an integer equal to `space_x` minus `remaining_cells`. If `space_x` is a multiple of 15, `extra_screen` is an integer equal to `space_x` divided by 15. If `space_x` is not a multiple of 15, `extra_screen` is an integer equal to `extra_space` divided by 15 plus 1. In all cases, `space_x` is either less than or equal to `remaining_cells` or more than `remaining_cells`, and the result list containing either `screen_require_for_y` or the sum of `extra_screen` and `screen_require_for_y` for each pair of integers `x` and `y` in `stdin` is being printed.**
