Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `result` is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 inputs: t-1 pairs of integers x and y, `_` is 0, `x` is an integer, `y` is an odd integer, `space_x` is an integer equal to `x`, `space_y` is an integer equal to 4 times `y`, `total_space` is an integer equal to 5 times `y` plus `x`, and `screen_require_for_y` is an integer equal to `y // 2 + 1`**

In this output state, the value of `screen_require_for_y` has been updated to `y // 2 + 1`, which is the integer division of `y` by 2 plus 1. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains t-1 pairs of integers x and y.
