According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, which means `n` is at least 1. So, the state of `n` needs to be adjusted to be at least 1. Also, the loop variable `_` is not used in the loop body, but it is still a variable in the loop head, so its state needs to be adjusted to be 0, which is the initial value of the loop variable in a `range` loop.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `result` is an empty list, stdin contains t inputs: t pairs of integers x and y, `_` is 0**
