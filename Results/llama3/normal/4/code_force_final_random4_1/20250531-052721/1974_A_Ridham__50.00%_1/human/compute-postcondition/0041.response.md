Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `result` is a list containing either `screen_require_for_y` or the sum of `extra_screen` and `screen_require_for_y`, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `space_x` is an integer equal to the new value of `x`, `space_y` is an integer equal to 4 times the new value of `y`, `total_space` is an integer equal to 5 times the new value of `y` plus the new value of `x`, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains t-6 inputs: t-6 pairs of integers `x` and `y`, `remaining_cells` is an integer equal to 15 times `screen_require_for_y` minus `space_y`, `extra_space` is an integer equal to `space_x` minus `remaining_cells`, `extra_screen` is an integer equal to `space_x` divided by 15, and if `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer equal to `y` divided by 2 and `remaining_cells` is an integer equal to 15 times `y` divided by 2 minus 4 times `y`. If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer equal to `y // 2 + 1` and `remaining_cells` is an integer equal to 15 times (`y // 2 + 1`) minus 4 times `y`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, then `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`. Otherwise, `extra_space` is an integer equal to `space_x` minus `remaining_cells`.**

In this output state, the value of `extra_screen` has been updated to be equal to `space_x` divided by 15. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions regarding the values of `y`, `screen_require_for_y`, `remaining_cells`, `extra_space`, and `space_x` are still valid.
