Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `result` is a list containing one integer which is the sum of `extra_screen` and `screen_require_for_y`, stdin contains t-2 inputs: t-2 pairs of integers x and y, `_` is 0, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `space_x` is an integer equal to `x`, `space_y` is an integer equal to 4 times `y`, `total_space` is an integer equal to 5 times `y` plus `x`. If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer equal to `y` divided by 2 and `remaining_cells` is an integer equal to 15 times `y` divided by 2 minus 4 times `y`. If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer equal to `y` // 2 + 1 and `remaining_cells` is an integer equal to 15 times (`y` // 2 + 1) minus 4 times `y`. `extra_space` is an integer equal to `space_x` minus `remaining_cells`. If `space_x` is a multiple of 15, `extra_screen` is an integer equal to `space_x` divided by 15. If `space_x` is not a multiple of 15, `extra_screen` is an integer equal to `extra_space` divided by 15 plus 1. In all cases, `space_x` is more than `remaining_cells`.**

In this output state, the value of `result` has been updated to include the sum of `extra_screen` and `screen_require_for_y`, which are calculated based on the values of `x` and `y`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin now contains one less pair of integers.
