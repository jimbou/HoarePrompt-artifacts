You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for understanding the program state at the start of the for loop. You will be provided with the program state after the previous iteration, which you need to modify. You will also see the for loop statement. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 10, `i` is 3, `n` must be  greater than 3.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.


Example Answer:
The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 4 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 4.
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 4, `n` must be  greater than 4**

Example 2:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 0, students_list is a list of students that must have at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list, index is 1 
```
for index, student in enumerate(students_list):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.


Example Answer:
The only objects in the loop head are variables  index, students  and list  students_list, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the student_list.  If the list has at least 3 students the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, students_list has at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list, index is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 students and the index is 2 and student is the trird student in the list.
State: **`total` is 0, students_list is a list of students that must have at least 3 students, student is the third student in the list, index is 3**


Your Task:
State at the end of the previous iteration: *n is at least 2, result is a list containing either screen_require_for_y or the sum of extra_screen and screen_require_for_y. stdin contains t-4 inputs: t-4 pairs of integers x and y, _ is 1, x is an integer, y is an integer, space_x is an integer equal to the new value of x, space_y is an integer equal to 4 times the new value of y, total_space is an integer equal to 5 times the new value of y plus the new value of x. If y is even, screen_require_for_y is an integer equal to y divided by 2 and remaining_cells is an integer equal to 15 times y divided by 2 minus 4 times y. If y is odd, screen_require_for_y is an integer equal to y // 2 + 1 and remaining_cells is an integer equal to 15 times (y // 2 + 1) minus 4 times y. remaining_cells is also equal to 15 times screen_require_for_y minus space_y. If space_x is less than or equal to remaining_cells, then space_x is less than or equal to remaining_cells. Otherwise, extra_space is an integer equal to space_x minus remaining_cells. If space_x is a multiple of 15, extra_screen is an integer equal to space_x divided by 15. If space_x is not a multiple of 15, extra_screen is an integer equal to extra_space divided by 15 plus 1. In all cases, space_x is either less than or equal to remaining_cells or more than remaining_cells.
```
for _ in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.
