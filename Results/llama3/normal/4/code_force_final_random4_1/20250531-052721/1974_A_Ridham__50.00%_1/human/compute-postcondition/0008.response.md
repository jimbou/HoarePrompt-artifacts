Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `result` is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 inputs: t-1 pairs of integers x and y, `_` is 0, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `space_x` is an integer equal to `x`, `space_y` is an integer equal to 4 times `y`, `total_space` is an integer equal to 5 times `y` plus `x`. If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer equal to `y` divided by 2 and `remaining_cells` is an integer equal to 15 times `y` divided by 2 minus 4 times `y`. If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is an integer equal to `y` // 2 + 1 and `remaining_cells` is an integer equal to 15 times (`y` // 2 + 1) minus 4 times `y`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `result`, `_`, `x`, `y`, `space_x`, `space_y`, and `total_space` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `screen_require_for_y` is determined based on whether `y` is even or odd. The new variable `remaining_cells` is calculated based on the value of `screen_require_for_y` and `space_y`. If `y` is even, `remaining_cells` is 15 times `y` divided by 2 minus 4 times `y`. If `y` is odd, `remaining_cells` is 15 times (`y` // 2 + 1) minus 4 times `y`.
