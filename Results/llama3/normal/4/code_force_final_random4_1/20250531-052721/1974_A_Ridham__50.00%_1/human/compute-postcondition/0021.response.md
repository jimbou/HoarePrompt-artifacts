Output State: **n is at least 2, result is a list containing either screen_require_for_y or the sum of extra_screen and screen_require_for_y, stdin contains t-3 inputs: t-3 pairs of integers x and y, _ is 1, x is an integer, y is an integer, space_x is an integer equal to the new value of x, space_y is an integer equal to 4 times the new value of y, total_space is an integer equal to 5 times the new value of y plus the new value of x. If the new value of y is even, screen_require_for_y is an integer equal to the new value of y divided by 2 and remaining_cells is an integer equal to 15 times the new value of y divided by 2 minus 4 times the new value of y. If the new value of y is odd, screen_require_for_y is an integer equal to the new value of y // 2 + 1 and remaining_cells is an integer equal to 15 times (the new value of y // 2 + 1) minus 4 times the new value of y. If space_x is less than or equal to remaining_cells, then space_x is less than or equal to remaining_cells. Otherwise, extra_space is an integer equal to space_x minus remaining_cells. If space_x is a multiple of 15, extra_screen is an integer equal to space_x divided by 15. If space_x is not a multiple of 15, extra_screen is an integer equal to extra_space divided by 15 plus 1. In all cases, space_x is either less than or equal to remaining_cells or more than remaining_cells.**

The code reads a pair of integers x and y from stdin, updates the values of space_x, space_y, and total_space based on the new values of x and y, and leaves all other variables unchanged. The new values of x and y are used to calculate the updated values of space_x, space_y, and total_space. The values of screen_require_for_y and remaining_cells are updated based on whether the new value of y is even or odd. The value of extra_space is updated if space_x is greater than remaining_cells, and the value of extra_screen is updated based on whether space_x is a multiple of 15.
