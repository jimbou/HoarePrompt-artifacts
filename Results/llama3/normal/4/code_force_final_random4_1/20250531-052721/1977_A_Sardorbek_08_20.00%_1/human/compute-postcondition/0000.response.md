The code `a = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `a`. Since the first line of the input contains a single integer `t` (1 <= t <= 100), this value is assigned to `a`. The remaining input lines, which contain two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 100), are still in the input buffer.

Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains t lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 100).**
