This function reads a series of input lines from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t, and each subsequent line contains two integers n and m. It then prints 'YES' if n equals m, 'NO' if n is less than m, and either 'Yes' or 'No' depending on whether t and n have the same parity if n is greater than or equal to m. The function processes t pairs of integers and prints a result for each pair.
