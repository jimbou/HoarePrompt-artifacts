Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it's possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, Nikita either puts exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of the tower.

The program correctly handles the case where n equals m by printing 'YES'. It also correctly handles the case where n is less than m by printing 'NO', because it's impossible to build a tower with more cubes than the number of moves.

However, the program incorrectly handles the case where n is greater than or equal to m. The condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2` is incorrect because it checks whether the number of test cases (a) and the number of moves (b) have the same parity, which is not relevant to the problem. The correct condition should be `elif (b - c) % 2 == 0`, which checks whether the difference between the number of moves (b) and the number of cubes (c) is even.

Therefore, the given Python program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
