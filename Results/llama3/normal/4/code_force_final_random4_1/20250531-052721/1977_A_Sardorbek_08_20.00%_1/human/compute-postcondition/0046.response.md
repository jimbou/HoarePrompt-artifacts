Output State: **a is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), i is a-1, b is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, c is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, q is a tuple containing two integers between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin is empty. If b is equal to c, 'YES' is printed. If b is not equal to c, then if b is less than c, 'NO' is printed. If b is greater than or equal to c, then if a and b have the same parity, 'Yes' is printed, otherwise 'No' is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `a` remains the same as the initial state, `i` is one less than `a`, `b` and `c` are the last pair of integers read from the input, `q` is a tuple containing these last two integers, and the input stream is empty because all lines have been read. The output will be a series of 'YES', 'NO', 'Yes', or 'No' printed to the console, depending on the values of `b` and `c` in each iteration, and the parity of `a` and `b`.
