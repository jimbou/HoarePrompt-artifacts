Output State: **a is an integer greater than 2, i is 2, b is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, c is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, q is a tuple containing two integers between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains at least a-3 lines of input, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100).**

The code reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to b and c, respectively. This reduces the number of lines in stdin by 1. The values of a, i, and q are not affected by the code. The parity of a and b, as well as the comparison between b and c, are not changed by the code.
