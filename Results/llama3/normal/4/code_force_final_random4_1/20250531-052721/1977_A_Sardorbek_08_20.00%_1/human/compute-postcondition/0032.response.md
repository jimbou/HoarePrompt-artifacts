Postcondition: ***a is an integer greater than 1, i is 1, b is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, c is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, q is a tuple containing two integers between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains at least a-2 lines of input, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100). If b is equal to c, 'YES' is printed. If b is not equal to c, then if b is less than c, 'NO' is printed. If b is greater than or equal to c, then if a and b have the same parity, 'Yes' is printed, otherwise 'No' is printed.***
