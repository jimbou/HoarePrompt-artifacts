Postcondition: ***a is an integer greater than or equal to 1, i is 0, b is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, c is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, q is a tuple containing two integers between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains at least a-1 lines of input, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100), b is not equal to c, and b is greater than or equal to c. The current value of a and b have the same parity.***
