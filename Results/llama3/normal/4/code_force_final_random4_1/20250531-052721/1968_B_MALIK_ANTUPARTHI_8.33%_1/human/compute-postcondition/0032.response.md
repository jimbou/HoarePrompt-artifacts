Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `b` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `c` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`, `j` is 0, and the current value of `k` is equal to the index of `d[j]` in `e` plus 1. The current value of `d[j]` is found in the substring of `e` starting from index `k-1`. Additionally, either `k` is equal to `c` or `j` is equal to `b - 1`***
