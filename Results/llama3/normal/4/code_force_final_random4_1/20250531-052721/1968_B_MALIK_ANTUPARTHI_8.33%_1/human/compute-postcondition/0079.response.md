Output State: **a is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is equal to a, b is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), c is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), d is a binary string of length b, e is a binary string of length c, j is equal to b, and k is equal to the minimum of b and c, and the minimum of b and c is being printed.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to the initial value of `a`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The values of `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e` will be the same as in the previous iterations, with `b` and `c` being integers between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), and `d` and `e` being binary strings of lengths `b` and `c` respectively. The value of `j` will be equal to `b`, and the value of `k` will be equal to the minimum of `b` and `c`. The minimum of `b` and `c` will be printed as the output.
