The only variable in the loop head is variable  j, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `b`. If `j` is less than `b`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `b` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again `j` must be 1 and `b` must be greater than 1.
State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `b` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `c` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, then if `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, `j` is 1 and `k` is 2. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables. If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, then `j` is 1 and `k` is 1.**
