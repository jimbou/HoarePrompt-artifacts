Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `b` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `c` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`, `j` is 1, `k` is either 2 or `e.index(d[0]) + 1`**.

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e` remains the same as in the initial state. The value of `i` is still 0. The value of `j` is now 1. The value of `k` is either 2 (if `d[0]` is not in `e[1:]`) or the index of `d[0]` in `e` plus 1 (if `d[0]` is in `e`).
