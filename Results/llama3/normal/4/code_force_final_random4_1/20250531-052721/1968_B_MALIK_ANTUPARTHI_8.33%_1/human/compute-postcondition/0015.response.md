Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `b` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `c` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`. If `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, then `j` is 1 and `k` is 2. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
