Output State: **`a` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `b` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `c` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`, `j` is 0, and `k` is the index of the first occurrence of `d[j]` in `e` plus 1.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated to be the index of the first occurrence of `d[j]` in `e` plus 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `d[j]` is found in the substring of `e` starting from index `k` is still valid, but now `k` has been updated to be the index of the first occurrence of `d[j]` in `e` plus 1.
