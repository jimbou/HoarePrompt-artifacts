Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `b` is an integer greater than 3 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `c` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, then if the index of the first occurrence of `d[j]` in `e` plus 1 equals `c` or the index of the current character in `d` being searched for in `e` equals `b - 1`, then `k` is the index of the current character in `d` plus 1 and `j` is the index of the current character in `d` being searched for in `e`. Otherwise, `k` is equal to `j`.***
