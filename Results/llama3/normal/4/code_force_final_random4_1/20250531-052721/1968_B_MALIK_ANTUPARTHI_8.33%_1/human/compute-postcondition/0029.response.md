According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `j` is equal to `b`, so for the loop to execute, `j` must be 0 (the first iteration) and `b` must be greater than 0.

State: **`a` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `b` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `c` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`, `j` is 0, `k` is 0**
