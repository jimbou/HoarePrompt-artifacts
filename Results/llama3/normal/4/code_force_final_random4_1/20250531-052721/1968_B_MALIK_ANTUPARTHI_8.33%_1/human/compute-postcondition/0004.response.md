Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `b` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `c` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`, `k` is 0, `j` is 0, stdin contains `t-2` test cases. The current value of `d[j]` is present in the substring of `e` starting from index `k`.***
