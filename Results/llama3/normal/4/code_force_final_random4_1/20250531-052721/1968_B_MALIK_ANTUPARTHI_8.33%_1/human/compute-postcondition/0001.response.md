To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the integer `a`. The loop will execute if `a` is at least 1.

State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two binary strings a and b of lengths n and m respectively.**
