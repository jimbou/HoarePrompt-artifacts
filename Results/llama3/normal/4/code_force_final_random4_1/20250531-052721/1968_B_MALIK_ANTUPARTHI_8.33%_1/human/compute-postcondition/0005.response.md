Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `b` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `c` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`, `k` is the index of the first occurrence of `d[j]` in `e` plus 1, `j` is 0, stdin contains `t-2` test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `i`, and `j` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `k` is updated to be the index of the first occurrence of the character at index `j` in string `d` within string `e`, plus 1. The stdin still contains `t-2` test cases.
