Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `b` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `c` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`. If the character at index `j` in string `d` is present in the substring of `e` starting from index `k`, then `k` is set to `j` and `j` is set to 0. If `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, then `k` is set to `j + 1` and `j` is set to 0. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
