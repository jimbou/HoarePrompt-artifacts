Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `b` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `c` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`, `j` is 1, `k` is an integer between 1 and `c` (inclusive) and is equal to the index of the substring `d[1]` in `e` plus 1.**

In this output state, the value of `k` is calculated by finding the index of the substring `d[1]` in `e` and adding 1 to it. The index is between 1 and `c` (inclusive) because `e` is a binary string of length `c`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
