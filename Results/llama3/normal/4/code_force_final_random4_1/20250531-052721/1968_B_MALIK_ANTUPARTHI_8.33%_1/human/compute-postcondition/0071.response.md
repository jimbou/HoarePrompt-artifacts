Output State: **`a` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `b` is an integer greater than 3 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `c` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`, `k` is the index of the first occurrence of `d[j]` in `e` plus 1, and `j` is the index of the current character in `d` being searched for in `e`.**

In this output state, the value of `k` is determined by finding the index of the first occurrence of the character `d[j]` in the string `e`, and then adding 1 to that index. The value of `j` is the index of the current character in `d` being searched for in `e`. The other variables remain unchanged.
