Output State: **a is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 0, b is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), c is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), d is a binary string of length b, e is a binary string of length c, k is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases.**

Explanation: The first line reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to b and c, respectively. The second line reads a binary string of length b from stdin and assigns it to d. The third line reads a binary string of length c from stdin and assigns it to e. The fourth line initializes k to 0. The values of a and i remain unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin decreases by 1.
