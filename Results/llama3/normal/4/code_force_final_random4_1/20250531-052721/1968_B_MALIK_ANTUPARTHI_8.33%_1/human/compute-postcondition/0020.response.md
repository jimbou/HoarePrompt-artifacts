The code snippet consists of two lines: `k = j + 1` and `break`. The first line assigns the value of `j + 1` to `k`. Since `j` is 1, `k` becomes 2. The second line, `break`, does not affect any variables.

Output State: **a is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 0, b is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), c is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), d is a binary string of length b, e is a binary string of length c, j is 1, k is 2**
