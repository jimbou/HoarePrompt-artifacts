Output State: **`a` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `b` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `c` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`, `j` is 0, `k` is equal to the index of `d[j]` in `e` plus 1, and the current value of `d[j]` is found in the substring of `e` starting from index `k-1`.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated to be the index of `d[j]` in `e` plus 1. This means that `k` now points to the position right after the occurrence of `d[j]` in `e`. The other variables remain unchanged.
