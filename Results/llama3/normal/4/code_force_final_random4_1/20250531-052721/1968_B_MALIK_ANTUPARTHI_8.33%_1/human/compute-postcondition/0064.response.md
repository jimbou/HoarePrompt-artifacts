According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `b`. If `j` is less than `b`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, `b` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 3 and `b` must be greater than 3.
State: **`a` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `b` is an integer greater than 3 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `c` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`.**
