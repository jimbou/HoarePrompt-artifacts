Output State: **a is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 0, b is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), c is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), d is a binary string of length b, e is a binary string of length c, k is equal to j, j is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, and the character at index j in string d is not present in the substring of e starting from index k**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated to be equal to `j`, which is 0. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The character at index `j` in string `d` is still not present in the substring of `e` starting from index `k`, as the value of `k` has been updated to match the value of `j`.
