To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(a):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `a`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `a` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive).

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.

The value of `a` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`a` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `b` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `c` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`, `j` is `b`, `k` is `b`**

Note that the values of `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged, as they are not involved in the loop head.
