The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `a` must be greater than 1.
State: **`a` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `b` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `c` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`, `j` is `b`, `k` is `c`**
