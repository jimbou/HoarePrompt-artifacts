The code snippet consists of two lines: `k = j + 1` and `break`. The first line assigns the value of `j + 1` to `k`. Since `j` is 2, `k` becomes 3. The second line, `break`, does not affect any variables.

Output State: **a is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), i is 1, b is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), c is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), d is a binary string of length b, e is a binary string of length c, j is 2, k is 3**
