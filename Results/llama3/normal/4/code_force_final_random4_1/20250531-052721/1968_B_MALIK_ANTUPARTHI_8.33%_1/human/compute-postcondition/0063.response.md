Postcondition: ***a is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), i is 2, b is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), c is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), d is a binary string of length b, e is a binary string of length c. If d[j] is in e[k:], then no changes are made to the variables. Otherwise, if k equals c or j equals b - 1, then j is 0 and k is equal to j + 1. Otherwise, j is 0 and k is 0.***
