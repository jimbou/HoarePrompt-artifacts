Postcondition: ***a is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), i is 1, b is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), c is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), d is a binary string of length b, e is a binary string of length c. If k equals c or j equals b - 1, then j is 0 and k is equal to j + 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
