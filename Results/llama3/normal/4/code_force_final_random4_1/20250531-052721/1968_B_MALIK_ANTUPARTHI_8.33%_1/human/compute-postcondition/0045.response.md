Output State: **a is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), i is 1, b is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), c is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), d is a binary string of length b, e is a binary string of length c, j is 2, k is the index of the first occurrence of d[2] in e plus 1.**

In this output state, the value of k is determined by finding the index of the first occurrence of the character at index 2 in string d within string e, and then adding 1 to that index. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
