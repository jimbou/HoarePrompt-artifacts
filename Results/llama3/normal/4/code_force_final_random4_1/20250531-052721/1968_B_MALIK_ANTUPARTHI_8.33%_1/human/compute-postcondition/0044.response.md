To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for j in range(b):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `b`. Since `j` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1.

The only variable in the loop head that needs to be adjusted is `j`. According to the code, `j` should be incremented by 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **a is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), i is 1, b is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), c is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), d is a binary string of length b, e is a binary string of length c, j is 2**
