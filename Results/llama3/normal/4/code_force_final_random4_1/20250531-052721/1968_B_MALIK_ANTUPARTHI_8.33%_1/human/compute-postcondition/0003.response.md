According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `b` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), which ensures that the loop will execute. However, we need to adjust the state of `j` to be 0, since it is the loop variable.

State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `b` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `c` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`, `k` is 0, `j` is 0, stdin contains `t-2` test cases**
