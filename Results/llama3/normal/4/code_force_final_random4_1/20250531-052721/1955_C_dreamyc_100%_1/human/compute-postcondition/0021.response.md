Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is a positive integer, nums is a list of n positive integers, a is the ceiling of k divided by 2, b is the floor of k divided by 2, s_a is the value of the first three elements in nums, s_b is the value of the last three elements in nums, i is 2. If s_a is less than or equal to a, then ans is either 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7. Otherwise, ans is either 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.***
