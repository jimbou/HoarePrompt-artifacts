Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic of the Kraken's attack. The problem statement specifies that the Kraken attacks the first ship, then the last, then the first again, and so on. However, the program does not simulate this process correctly.

The program uses two variables, `a` and `b`, to keep track of the number of attacks on the first and last ships, respectively. However, it does not correctly update these variables based on the durability of the ships.

For example, consider the case where `n=4`, `k=5`, and `a=[1, 2, 4, 3]`. The program will calculate `a=3` and `b=2`, and then check if the sum of the durability of the first `a` ships and the last `b` ships is less than or equal to `a` and `b`, respectively. However, this does not correctly simulate the Kraken's attack process.

A correct implementation would involve simulating the Kraken's attack process step by step, reducing the durability of the ships accordingly, and checking if a ship sinks after each attack.

Here is an example of a correct implementation:
```
def func_1(n, k, nums):
    ships = deque(nums)
    for _ in range(k):
        if _ % 2 == 0:
            ships[0] -= 1
            if ships[0] == 0:
                ships.popleft()
        else:
            ships[-1] -= 1
            if ships[-1] == 0:
                ships.pop()
    return n - len(ships)
```
This implementation uses a deque to simulate the Kraken's attack process, reducing the durability of the ships accordingly, and checking if a ship sinks after each attack.
