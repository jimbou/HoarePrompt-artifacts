Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is a positive integer, nums is a list of n positive integers, a is the ceiling of k divided by 2, b is the floor of k divided by 2, s_a is the value of the first three elements in nums, s_b is the value of the last three elements in nums, i is 2. If s_a is less than or equal to a and s_b is less than or equal to b, then ans is either 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8. If s_a is less than or equal to a and s_b is greater than b, then ans is either 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7. If s_a is greater than a, then ans is either 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.***
