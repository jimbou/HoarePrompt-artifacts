Functionality: **This function determines the maximum number of positive integers that can be selected from a list of positive integers, such that the sum of the selected integers does not exceed a given target value k. If the sum of all integers in the list is less than or equal to k, the function returns the total number of integers in the list. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of integers that can be selected by considering two cases: selecting integers from the start of the list and selecting integers from the end of the list. The function returns the total number of integers that can be selected in both cases, which can be up to twice the total number of integers in the list, or up to the total number of integers in the list minus 4.**
