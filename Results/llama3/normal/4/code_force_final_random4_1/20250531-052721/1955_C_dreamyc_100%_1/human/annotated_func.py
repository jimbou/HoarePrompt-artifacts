#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, and nums is a list of n positive integers.

        #The program returns a positive integer n, which is the number of positive integers in the list nums.

    #State: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, nums is a list of n positive integers, a is the ceiling of k divided by 2, b is the floor of k divided by 2, s_a is the sum of all elements in nums, s_b is the sum of all elements in nums, i is n-1. If s_a is less than or equal to a and s_b is less than or equal to b, then ans is either 2n, 2n-1, 2n-2, 2n-3, or 2n-4. If s_a is less than or equal to a and s_b is greater than b, then ans is either n, n-1, n-2, n-3, or n-4. If s_a is greater than a, then ans is either n, n-1, n-2, n-3, or n-4.
    return ans
    #The program returns ans, which is either 2n, 2n-1, 2n-2, 2n-3, 2n-4, n, n-1, n-2, n-3, or n-4, where n is a positive integer.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines the maximum number of positive integers that can be selected from a list of positive integers, such that the sum of the selected integers does not exceed a given target value k. If the sum of all integers in the list is less than or equal to k, the function returns the total number of integers in the list. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of integers that can be selected by considering two cases: selecting integers from the start of the list and selecting integers from the end of the list. The function returns the total number of integers that can be selected in both cases, which can be up to twice the total number of integers in the list, or up to the total number of integers in the list minus 4.
