Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer, `nums` is a list of `n` positive integers, `a` is the ceiling of `k` divided by 2, `b` is the floor of `k` divided by 2, `s_a` is the value of the first three elements in `nums`, `s_b` is the value of the last three elements in `nums`, `i` is 2, `ans` is either 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, so it can now take on values from 3 to 7. The other variables remain unchanged.
