Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, nums is a list of n positive integers, a is the ceiling of k divided by 2, b is the floor of k divided by 2, s_a is the sum of all elements in nums, s_b is the sum of all elements in nums, i is n-1. If s_a is less than or equal to a and s_b is less than or equal to b, then ans is either 2n, 2n-1, 2n-2, 2n-3, or 2n-4. If s_a is less than or equal to a and s_b is greater than b, then ans is either n, n-1, n-2, n-3, or n-4. If s_a is greater than a, then ans is either n, n-1, n-2, n-3, or n-4.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows:

* The variables `n`, `k`, `nums`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial state.
* The variable `s_a` is the sum of all elements in the list `nums`.
* The variable `s_b` is also the sum of all elements in the list `nums`.
* The variable `i` is `n-1`, indicating that the loop has executed `n` times.
* The value of `ans` depends on the values of `s_a` and `s_b`:
	+ If `s_a` is less than or equal to `a` and `s_b` is less than or equal to `b`, then `ans` is either `2n`, `2n-1`, `2n-2`, `2n-3`, or `2n-4`.
	+ If `s_a` is less than or equal to `a` and `s_b` is greater than `b`, then `ans` is either `n`, `n-1`, `n-2`, `n-3`, or `n-4`.
	+ If `s_a` is greater than `a`, then `ans` is either `n`, `n-1`, `n-2`, `n-3`, or `n-4`.
