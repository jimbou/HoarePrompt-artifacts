State: **n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is a positive integer, nums is a list of n positive integers, a is the ceiling of k divided by 2, b is the floor of k divided by 2, s_a is the value of the first element in nums plus the value of the second element in nums, s_b is the value of the last element in nums plus the value of the second last element in nums, i is 2. If s_a is less than or equal to a, then ans is either 2, 3, or 4. If s_b is less than or equal to b, then ans is either 3, 4, or 5. Otherwise, ans is increased by 1.**
