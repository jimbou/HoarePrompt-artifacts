Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer, `nums` is a list of `n` positive integers, `a` is the ceiling of `k` divided by 2, `b` is the floor of `k` divided by 2, `s_a` is the value of the first element in `nums` plus the value of the second element in `nums`, `s_b` is the value of the last element in `nums` plus the value of the second last element in `nums`, `i` is 1, `ans` is either 2, 3, or 4.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1. The initial value of `ans` was either 1, 2, or remained unchanged, so after incrementing by 1, it can now be either 2, 3, or 4. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
