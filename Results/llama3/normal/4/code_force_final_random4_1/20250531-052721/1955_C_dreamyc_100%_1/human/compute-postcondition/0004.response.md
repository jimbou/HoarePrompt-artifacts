To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer, `nums` is a list of n positive integers, `a` is the ceiling of k divided by 2, `b` is the floor of k divided by 2, `ans` is 0, `s_a` is 0, `s_b` is 0, `i` is 0**
