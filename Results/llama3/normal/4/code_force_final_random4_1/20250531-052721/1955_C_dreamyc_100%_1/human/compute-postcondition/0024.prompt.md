Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, nums is a list of n positive integers, a is the ceiling of k divided by 2, b is the floor of k divided by 2, ans is 0, s_a is 0, s_b is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    s_a += nums[i]
    s_b += nums[n - i - 1]
    if s_a <= a:
        ans += 1
    if s_b <= b:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer, `nums` is a list of `n` positive integers, `a` is the ceiling of `k` divided by 2, `b` is the floor of `k` divided by 2, `s_a` is the value of the first element in `nums`, `s_b` is the value of the last element in `nums`, `i` is 0. If the value of the first element in `nums` is less than or equal to `a`, then `ans` is 1. If the value of the last element in `nums` is less than or equal to `b`, then `ans` is either 2 or remains unchanged if the value of the first element in `nums` is greater than `a`. Otherwise, no change is made to `ans`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is a positive integer, nums is a list of n positive integers, a is the ceiling of k divided by 2, b is the floor of k divided by 2, s_a is the value of the first element in nums plus the value of the second element in nums, s_b is the value of the last element in nums plus the value of the second last element in nums, i is 1. If s_a is less than or equal to a, then ans is either 2, 3, or 4. If s_b is less than or equal to b, then ans is either 3, 4, or 5. Otherwise, ans is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is a positive integer, nums is a list of n positive integers, a is the ceiling of k divided by 2, b is the floor of k divided by 2, s_a is the value of the first three elements in nums, s_b is the value of the last three elements in nums, i is 2. If s_a is less than or equal to a and s_b is less than or equal to b, then ans is either 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8. If s_a is less than or equal to a and s_b is greater than b, then ans is either 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7. If s_a is greater than a, then ans is either 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
