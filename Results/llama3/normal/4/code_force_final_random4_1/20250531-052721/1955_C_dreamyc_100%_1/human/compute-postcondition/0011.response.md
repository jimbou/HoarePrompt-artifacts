Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer, `nums` is a list of `n` positive integers, `a` is the ceiling of `k` divided by 2, `b` is the floor of `k` divided by 2, `s_a` is the value of the first element in `nums`, `s_b` is the value of the last element in `nums`, `i` is 0. If the value of the first element in `nums` is less than or equal to `a`, then `ans` is 1. If the value of the last element in `nums` is less than or equal to `b`, then `ans` is either 2 or remains unchanged if the value of the first element in `nums` is greater than `a`. Otherwise, no change is made to `ans`.***
