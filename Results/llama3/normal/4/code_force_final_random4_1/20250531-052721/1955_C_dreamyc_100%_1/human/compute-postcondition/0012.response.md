The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer, `nums` is a list of `n` positive integers, `a` is the ceiling of `k` divided by 2, `b` is the floor of `k` divided by 2, `s_a` is the value of the first element in `nums`, `s_b` is the value of the last element in `nums`, `i` is 1. If the value of the first element in `nums` is less than or equal to `a`, then `ans` is 1. If the value of the last element in `nums` is less than or equal to `b`, then `ans` is either 2 or remains unchanged if the value of the first element in `nums` is greater than `a`. Otherwise, no change is made to `ans`.**
