Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is a positive integer, nums is a list of n positive integers, a is the ceiling of k divided by 2, b is the floor of k divided by 2, s_a is the value of the first element in nums plus the value of the second element in nums, s_b is the value of the last element in nums plus the value of the second last element in nums, i is 1, ans is either 1, 2, or remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `nums`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `s_a` is updated to be the sum of the first element in `nums` and the second element in `nums`, and the value of `s_b` is updated to be the sum of the last element in `nums` and the second last element in `nums`. The value of `ans` is either 1, 2, or remains unchanged based on the conditions specified in the initial state.
