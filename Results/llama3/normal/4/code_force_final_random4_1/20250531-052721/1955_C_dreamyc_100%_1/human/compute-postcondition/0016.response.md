Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer, `nums` is a list of `n` positive integers, `a` is the ceiling of `k` divided by 2, `b` is the floor of `k` divided by 2, `s_a` is the value of the first element in `nums` plus the value of the second element in `nums`, `s_b` is the value of the last element in `nums` plus the value of the second last element in `nums`, `i` is 1, `ans` is either 3, 4, or 5 if `s_a` is less than or equal to `a`, otherwise `ans` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1. If `s_a` is less than or equal to `a`, then `ans` can take values 3, 4, or 5. Otherwise, the value of `ans` is increased by 1 from its previous value. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
