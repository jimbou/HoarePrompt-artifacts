The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `k` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 997, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `f` is an integer equal to the second input, `k` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers equal to the second line of input, `favorite_value` is an integer equal to the (`f`-1)th element of `a`, `sorted_a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order equal to the sorted version of `a`, `stdin` contains `t` - 5 test cases, `_` is 2, `i` is 2, and `removed_count` is 2 if the current value of `sorted_a[i]` is equal to `favorite_value`, otherwise `removed_count` remains 1**
