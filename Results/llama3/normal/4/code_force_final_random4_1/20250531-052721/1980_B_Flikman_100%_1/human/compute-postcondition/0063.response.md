Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 997, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `f` is an integer equal to the second input, `k` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers equal to the second line of input, `favorite_value` is an integer equal to the (`f`-1)th element of `a`, `sorted_a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order equal to the sorted version of `a`, `stdin` contains `t` - 5 test cases, `_` is 2, `i` is 2, and `removed_count` is 3 if the current value of `sorted_a[i]` is equal to `favorite_value`, otherwise `removed_count` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `removed_count` has been incremented by 1. If the current value of `sorted_a[i]` is equal to `favorite_value`, then `removed_count` is now 3, otherwise it remains 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
