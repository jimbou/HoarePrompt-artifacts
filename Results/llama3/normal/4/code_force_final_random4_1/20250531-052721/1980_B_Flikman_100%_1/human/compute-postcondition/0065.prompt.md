Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 997, n is an integer equal to the first input, f is an integer equal to the second input, k is an integer equal to the third input, a is a list of integers equal to the second line of input, favorite_value is an integer equal to the (f-1)th element of a, sorted_a is a sorted list of integers in descending order equal to the sorted version of a, stdin contains t - 5 test cases, i is k, _ is 2, removed_count is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if sorted_a[i] == favorite_value:
        removed_count += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 997, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `f` is an integer equal to the second input, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers equal to the second line of input, `favorite_value` is an integer equal to the (`f`-1)th element of `a`, `sorted_a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order equal to the sorted version of `a`, `stdin` contains `t` - 5 test cases, `_` is 2, `i` is 0, and `removed_count` is 1 if the current value of `sorted_a[i]` is equal to `favorite_value`, otherwise `removed_count` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 997, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `f` is an integer equal to the second input, `k` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers equal to the second line of input, `favorite_value` is an integer equal to the (`f`-1)th element of `a`, `sorted_a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order equal to the sorted version of `a`, `stdin` contains `t` - 5 test cases, `_` is 2, `i` is 1, and `removed_count` is 2 if the current value of `sorted_a[i]` is equal to `favorite_value`, otherwise `removed_count` remains 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 997, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `f` is an integer equal to the second input, `k` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers equal to the second line of input, `favorite_value` is an integer equal to the (`f`-1)th element of `a`, `sorted_a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order equal to the sorted version of `a`, `stdin` contains `t` - 5 test cases, `_` is 2, `i` is 2, and `removed_count` is 3 if the current value of `sorted_a[i]` is equal to `favorite_value`, otherwise `removed_count` remains 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
