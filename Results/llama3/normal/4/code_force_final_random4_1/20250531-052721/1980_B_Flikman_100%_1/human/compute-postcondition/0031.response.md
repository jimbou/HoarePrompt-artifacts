Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `favorite_value` is an integer, `sorted_a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `removed_count` is 1, `i` is 0, `_` is 1, stdin contains t - 3 test cases, and the current value of `sorted_a[i]` is equal to `favorite_value`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `removed_count` has been incremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The list `sorted_a` is still sorted in descending order, and its current value at index `i` is still equal to `favorite_value`. The number of test cases in stdin remains the same.
