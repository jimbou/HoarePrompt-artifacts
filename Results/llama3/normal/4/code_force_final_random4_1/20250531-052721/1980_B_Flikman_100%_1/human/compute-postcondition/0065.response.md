Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 997, n is an integer equal to the first input, f is an integer equal to the second input, k is an integer equal to the third input, a is a list of integers equal to the second line of input, favorite_value is an integer equal to the (f-1)th element of a, sorted_a is a sorted list of integers in descending order equal to the sorted version of a, stdin contains t - 5 test cases, _ is 2, i is k, and removed_count is equal to the number of occurrences of favorite_value in sorted_a.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that all variables not affected by the loop head and body remain unchanged. The loop counter `i` is equal to `k`, and the `removed_count` is equal to the number of occurrences of `favorite_value` in the sorted list `sorted_a`.
