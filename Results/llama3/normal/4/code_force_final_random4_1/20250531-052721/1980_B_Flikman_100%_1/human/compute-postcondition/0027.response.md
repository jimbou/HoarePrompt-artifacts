The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `stdin` contains `t - 2` test cases, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `favorite_value` is an integer, `sorted_a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `i` is `k - 1**
