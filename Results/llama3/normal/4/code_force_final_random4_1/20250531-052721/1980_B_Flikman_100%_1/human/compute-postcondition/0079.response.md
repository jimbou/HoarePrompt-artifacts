Output State: **t is an integer equal to 0, stdin contains 0 test cases, _ is t, n is an integer equal to the first input, f is an integer equal to the second input, k is an integer equal to the third input, a is a list of integers equal to the second line of input, favorite_value is an integer equal to the (f-1)th element of a, sorted_a is a sorted list of integers in descending order equal to the sorted version of a, removed_count is an integer, favorite_count is an integer equal to the number of occurrences of favorite_value in sorted_a, i is k. If the number of occurrences of favorite_value in sorted_a is equal to the number of removed favorite_value in sorted_a, 'YES' is printed. If the number of occurrences of favorite_value in sorted_a is not equal to the number of removed favorite_value in sorted_a, then if removed_count is 0, 'NO' is printed, otherwise 'MAYBE' is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the number of test cases (t) will be 0, and the standard input (stdin) will be empty. The loop counter (_) will be equal to the initial number of test cases (t). The variables n, f, k, a, favorite_value, sorted_a, removed_count, favorite_count, and i will retain their values from the last iteration of the loop. The loop will have printed 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' for each test case, depending on the number of occurrences of the favorite value in the sorted list and the number of removed favorite values.
