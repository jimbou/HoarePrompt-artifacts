State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 997, `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `favorite_value` is an integer, `sorted_a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `stdin` contains `t - 4` test cases, `i` is `k`, `_` is 2, `removed_count` is either `k` or the number of times `sorted_a[i]` is equal to `favorite_value` for `i` in range(`k`), `favorite_count` is the total number of times `favorite_value` appears in `sorted_a`. If the current value of `removed_count` is equal to the total number of times `favorite_value` appears in `sorted_a`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if `removed_count` is 0, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'MAYBE' is printed.**
