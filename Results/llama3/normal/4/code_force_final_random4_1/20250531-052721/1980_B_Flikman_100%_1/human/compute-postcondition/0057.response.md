Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 997, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `f` is an integer equal to the second input, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers equal to the second line of input, `favorite_value` is an integer equal to the (`f`-1)th element of `a`, `sorted_a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order equal to the sorted version of `a`, `stdin` contains `t` - 5 test cases, `_` is 2, `removed_count` is 1, `i` is 0, and the current value of `sorted_a[i]` is equal to `favorite_value`.**

In this output state, the value of `removed_count` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still 0, and the current value of `sorted_a[i]` is still equal to `favorite_value`. The stdin still contains `t` - 5 test cases.
