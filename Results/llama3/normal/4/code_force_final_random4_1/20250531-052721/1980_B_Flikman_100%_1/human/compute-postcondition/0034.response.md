Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `favorite_value` is an integer, `sorted_a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `stdin` contains `t - 3` test cases, `i` is 1, `_` is 1, `removed_count` is either 1 or 2. If the current value of `sorted_a[i]` is equal to `favorite_value`, then `removed_count` is 2. Otherwise, `removed_count` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `removed_count` has been incremented by 1. If the current value of `sorted_a[i]` is equal to `favorite_value`, then `removed_count` is now 2. Otherwise, `removed_count` is now 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
