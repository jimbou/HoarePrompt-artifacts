Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, f, and k (1 <= f, k <= n <= 100). The second line contains n integers a_i (1 <= a_i <= 100).**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the integer input from stdin, which is between 1 and 1000. The remaining input in stdin consists of `t` test cases, each with two lines. The first line of each test case contains three integers `n`, `f`, and `k`, where `1 <= f, k <= n <= 100`. The second line of each test case contains `n` integers `a_i`, where `1 <= a_i <= 100`.
