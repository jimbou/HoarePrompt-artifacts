Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in all cases. For example, if the input is:

5 2 2
4 3 3 2 3

The program will output "MAYBE", but the correct output should be "YES" because the favorite cube will be removed in all cases.

The issue with the program is that it only checks if the favorite cube is among the first k cubes in the sorted list, but it does not consider the case where the favorite cube is tied with other cubes in terms of value. In this case, the program should output "YES" because the favorite cube will be removed in all cases, but it outputs "MAYBE" instead.

To fix this issue, the program should be modified to check if the favorite cube is among the first k cubes in the sorted list, and also check if there are any other cubes with the same value as the favorite cube that are not among the first k cubes. If there are no such cubes, then the program should output "YES", otherwise it should output "MAYBE".
