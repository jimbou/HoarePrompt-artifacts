Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 997, n is an integer equal to the first input, f is an integer equal to the second input, k is an integer equal to the third input, a is a list of integers equal to the second line of input, favorite_value is an integer equal to the (f-1)th element of a, sorted_a is a sorted list of integers in descending order equal to the sorted version of a, favorite_count is an integer equal to the number of occurrences of favorite_value in sorted_a, removed_count is an integer, stdin contains t - 6 test cases, _ is 2, i is k. If the number of occurrences of favorite_value in sorted_a is equal to the number of removed favorite_value in sorted_a, 'YES' is printed. If the number of occurrences of favorite_value in sorted_a is not equal to the number of removed favorite_value in sorted_a, then if removed_count is 0, 'NO' is printed, otherwise 'MAYBE' is printed.**
