#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, f, and k (1 <= f, k <= n <= 100). The second line contains n integers a_i (1 <= a_i <= 100).
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        favorite_value = a[f - 1]
        
        sorted_a = sorted(a, reverse=True)
        
        removed_count = 0
        
        for i in range(k):
            if sorted_a[i] == favorite_value:
                removed_count += 1
        
        favorite_count = sorted_a.count(favorite_value)
        
        if removed_count == favorite_count:
            print('YES')
        elif removed_count == 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('MAYBE')
        
    #State: t is an integer equal to 0, stdin contains 0 test cases, _ is t, n is an integer equal to the first input, f is an integer equal to the second input, k is an integer equal to the third input, a is a list of integers equal to the second line of input, favorite_value is an integer equal to the (f-1)th element of a, sorted_a is a sorted list of integers in descending order equal to the sorted version of a, removed_count is an integer, favorite_count is an integer equal to the number of occurrences of favorite_value in sorted_a, i is k. If the number of occurrences of favorite_value in sorted_a is equal to the number of removed favorite_value in sorted_a, 'YES' is printed. If the number of occurrences of favorite_value in sorted_a is not equal to the number of removed favorite_value in sorted_a, then if removed_count is 0, 'NO' is printed, otherwise 'MAYBE' is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' based on the occurrence of a favorite value in a sorted list of integers. It accepts no parameters and returns no value, but instead prints the result for each test case. The function's purpose is to determine whether a favorite value is completely removed, not removed at all, or partially removed from the sorted list after removing the top k elements.
