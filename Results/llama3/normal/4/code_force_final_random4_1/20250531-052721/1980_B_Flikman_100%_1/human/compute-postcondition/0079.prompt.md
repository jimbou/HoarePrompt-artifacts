Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, f, and k (1 <= f, k <= n <= 100). The second line contains n integers a_i (1 <= a_i <= 100).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    favorite_value = a[f - 1]
    sorted_a = sorted(a, reverse=True)
    removed_count = 0
    for i in range(k):
        if sorted_a[i] == favorite_value:
            removed_count += 1
    favorite_count = sorted_a.count(favorite_value)
    if removed_count == favorite_count:
        print('YES')
    elif removed_count == 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('MAYBE')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `favorite_value` is an integer, `sorted_a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `i` is `k - 1`. If the number of occurrences of `favorite_value` in `sorted_a` up to index `k - 1` equals the total number of occurrences of `favorite_value` in `sorted_a`, 'YES' is printed. If the number of occurrences of `favorite_value` in `sorted_a` up to index `k - 1` is 0, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'MAYBE' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 2 and 1000, n is an integer, f is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, favorite_value is an integer, sorted_a is a sorted list of integers in descending order, stdin contains t - 3 test cases, i is k, _ is 1, removed_count is either k or the number of times sorted_a[i] is equal to favorite_value for i in range(k), favorite_count is the total number of times favorite_value appears in sorted_a. If the current value of removed_count is equal to the total number of times favorite_value appears in sorted_a, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if removed_count is 0, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'MAYBE' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 997, n is an integer equal to the first input, f is an integer equal to the second input, k is an integer equal to the third input, a is a list of integers equal to the second line of input, favorite_value is an integer equal to the (f-1)th element of a, sorted_a is a sorted list of integers in descending order equal to the sorted version of a, favorite_count is an integer equal to the number of occurrences of favorite_value in sorted_a, removed_count is an integer, stdin contains t - 6 test cases, _ is 2, i is k. If the number of occurrences of favorite_value in sorted_a is equal to the number of removed favorite_value in sorted_a, 'YES' is printed. If the number of occurrences of favorite_value in sorted_a is not equal to the number of removed favorite_value in sorted_a, then if removed_count is 0, 'NO' is printed, otherwise 'MAYBE' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
