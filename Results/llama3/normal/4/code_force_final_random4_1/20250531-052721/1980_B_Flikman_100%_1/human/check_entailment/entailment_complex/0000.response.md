Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether the favorite cube will be removed in all cases, not removed in any case, or may be either removed or left.

Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. The program correctly reads the input and initializes the variables.
2. It correctly sorts the list of cubes in non-increasing order.
3. It correctly counts the number of removed favorite cubes by iterating through the first k elements of the sorted list.
4. It correctly counts the total number of favorite cubes in the sorted list.
5. The program correctly prints 'YES' if the number of removed favorite cubes is equal to the total number of favorite cubes, 'NO' if the number of removed favorite cubes is 0, and 'MAYBE' otherwise.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
