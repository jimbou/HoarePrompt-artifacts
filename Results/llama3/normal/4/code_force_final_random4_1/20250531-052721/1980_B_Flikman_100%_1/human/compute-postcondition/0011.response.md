Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `k` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers, `favorite_value` is an integer, `sorted_a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `i` is 2, `removed_count` is either 2 or 3**

In this output state, the value of `removed_count` has been incremented by 1, so it can now be either 2 or 3. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
