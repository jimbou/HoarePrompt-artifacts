Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `favorite_value` is an integer, `sorted_a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `i` is `k - 1`, `removed_count` is the number of occurrences of `favorite_value` in `sorted_a` up to index `k - 1`, `favorite_count` is the total number of occurrences of `favorite_value` in `sorted_a`. The number of occurrences of `favorite_value` in `sorted_a` up to index `k - 1` is not equal to the total number of occurrences of `favorite_value` in `sorted_a`.***
