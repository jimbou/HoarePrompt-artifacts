Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 1000, n is an integer, f is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, favorite_value is an integer, sorted_a is a sorted list of integers in descending order, stdin contains t - 3 test cases, i is k, _ is 1. If the current value of sorted_a[i] is equal to favorite_value for all i in range(k), then removed_count is k. Otherwise, removed_count is the number of times sorted_a[i] is equal to favorite_value for i in range(k).**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will have the same values for all variables except for `i` and `removed_count`. The value of `i` will be equal to `k`, and the value of `removed_count` will be equal to the number of times `sorted_a[i]` is equal to `favorite_value` for all `i` in the range of `k`. If `sorted_a[i]` is equal to `favorite_value` for all `i` in the range of `k`, then `removed_count` will be equal to `k`. Otherwise, `removed_count` will be less than `k`.
