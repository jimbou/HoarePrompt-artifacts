This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' based on the occurrence of a favorite value in a sorted list of integers. It accepts no parameters and returns no value, but instead prints the result for each test case. The function's purpose is to determine whether a favorite value is completely removed, not removed at all, or partially removed from the sorted list after removing the top k elements.
