Reasoning:

The problem requires finding a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. The program provided attempts to solve this problem.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, the program reads two integers `n` and `k` and calls the function `func_1`.
3. The function `func_1` takes `n` and `k` as input and returns a string `s`.
4. The string `s` is constructed by repeating the first `k` lowercase English alphabets `n` times.

Now, let's analyze the correctness of the program:

* The program correctly reads the input and calls the function `func_1` for each test case.
* The function `func_1` correctly constructs the string `s` by repeating the first `k` lowercase English alphabets `n` times.
* However, the program does not check if the constructed string `s` satisfies the condition that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`.

To verify the correctness of the program, we need to check if the constructed string `s` indeed contains all possible subsequences of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

After analyzing the problem and the program, it appears that the program is correct. The constructed string `s` indeed contains all possible subsequences of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

Correctness: **True**
