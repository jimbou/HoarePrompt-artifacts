Output State: **stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 676). Each of the following t lines contains two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 26) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ 26), n is an integer, k is an integer, s is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'**

The first line reads two integers from the first line of stdin and assigns them to `n` and `k`, respectively. Since stdin contains multiple lines of input, after this line executes, stdin still contains multiple lines of input, but the first line has been consumed. The second line assigns the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' to `s`. No other variables are affected.
