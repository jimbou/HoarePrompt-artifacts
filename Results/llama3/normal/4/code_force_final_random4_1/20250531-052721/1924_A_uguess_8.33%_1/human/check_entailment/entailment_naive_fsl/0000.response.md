Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the string `s` contains characters that are not in the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. In this case, the program will incorrectly count these characters as part of the subsequences, leading to incorrect results.

For example, if `n = 2`, `k = 2`, and `s = "abx"`, the program will incorrectly count the character 'x' as part of the subsequences, and will print "YES" even though the string "aa" is not a subsequence of "abx".

To fix this issue, the program should ignore characters in `s` that are not in the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
