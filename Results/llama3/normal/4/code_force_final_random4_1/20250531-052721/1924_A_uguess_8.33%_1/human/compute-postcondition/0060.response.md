Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, each consisting of three integers n, k, and m, followed by a string s of length m that must have at least 2 characters, n is an integer, k is an integer, m is an integer, cnt is 2, cur is 0, ss is the second character in the string s, cur_ss is the ASCII value of the second character in the string s minus the ASCII value of 'a', which is a value between 0 and 25 (inclusive).**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1, making it 2. The value of `cur` has been reset to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
