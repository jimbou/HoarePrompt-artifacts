The code prints the string `ans`, which consists of `cnt` repetitions of the character that is `k-1` positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet, followed by `n - cnt - 1` repetitions of 'a'. 

Here, `cnt` is the number of times `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, `k` is an integer, and `n` is an integer. 

Since the exact values of `cnt`, `k`, and `n` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the string `ans` as described above.

Output: **cnt repetitions of the character that is k-1 positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet, followed by n - cnt - 1 repetitions of 'a'**
