The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `k` must be greater than 1.
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is 2, stdin contains t-3 test cases, each consisting of three integers n, k, and m, followed by a string s of length m, n is an integer, k must be greater than 1, m is an integer, cnt is an integer that represents the number of times cur equals (1 << k) - 1, ss is the last character in the string s, cur_ss is the ASCII value of the last character in the string s minus the ASCII value of 'a', which is a value between 0 and 25 (inclusive), cur is either 0 or a value that represents the current state of the string s, tmp is either an empty string or 'b', ans is a string consisting of cnt repetitions of the character that is k-1 positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet, and 'NO' is being printed. The current value of cur either has or does not have the bit at position i set to 1.**
