Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 3, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by a string `s` of length `m`, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than 3, `m` is an integer, `cnt` is an integer that represents the number of times `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, `ss` is the last character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the last character in the string `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a', which is a value between 0 and 25 (inclusive), `cur` is either 0 or a value that represents the current state of the string `s`, `tmp` is 'd', `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` repetitions of the character that is `k-1` positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet, and 'NO' is being printed.**

In this output state, the value of `tmp` has been updated to 'd', which is the character that is 3 positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet, since `i` is 3. The other variables remain unchanged.
