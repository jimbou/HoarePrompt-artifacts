Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases, each consisting of three integers n, k, and m, followed by a string s of length m, n is an integer, k is an integer, m is an integer, cnt is an integer, s is a string of length m, ss is the last character in the string s, cur_ss is the ASCII value of the last character in the string s minus the ASCII value of 'a', which is a value between 0 and 25 (inclusive), cur is either 0 or a value between 1 and (1 << k) - 1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s` remain unchanged. The value of `cnt` is the number of times the string `s` contains all `k` characters. The value of `ss` is the last character in the string `s`. The value of `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the last character in the string `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. The value of `cur` is either 0 or a value between 1 and `(1 << k) - 1`, depending on whether the last character in the string `s` is the last character needed to contain all `k` characters.
