Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, each consisting of three integers n, k, and m, followed by a string s of length m, n is an integer, k is an integer, m is an integer, cnt is an integer that represents the number of times cur equals (1 << k) - 1, ss is the last character in the string s, cur_ss is the ASCII value of the last character in the string s minus the ASCII value of 'a', which is a value between 0 and 25 (inclusive), cur is either 0 or a value that represents the current state of the string s.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a state where the loop has processed all the characters in the string s. The value of cnt represents the number of times the loop has encountered a character that makes cur equal to (1 << k) - 1, which means that all k characters have been seen. The value of ss is the last character in the string s, and cur_ss is its ASCII value minus the ASCII value of 'a'. The value of cur is either 0, indicating that all k characters have been seen, or a value that represents the current state of the string s, indicating that not all k characters have been seen.
