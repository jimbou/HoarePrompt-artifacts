Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to check if all possible strings of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of the given string s.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program correctly reads the input values of n, k, and m, and the string s from the standard input.
2. It initializes a counter cnt to 0, which will be used to count the number of substrings of length k that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets.
3. It initializes a variable cur to 0, which will be used to keep track of the current substring being formed.
4. The program then iterates through each character in the string s. For each character, it checks if the character is not already present in the current substring (cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0). If it's not present, it adds the character to the current substring (cur += 1 << cur_ss).
5. If the current substring is complete (cur == (1 << k) - 1), it increments the counter cnt and resets the current substring cur to 0.
6. After iterating through all characters in the string s, the program checks if the counter cnt is greater than or equal to n. If it is, it prints 'YES', indicating that all possible strings of length n can be formed as a subsequence of s.
7. If cnt is less than n, the program prints 'NO' and constructs a string that represents the shortest possible completion of s to meet the condition. It does this by appending the missing characters to the end of the string s.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
