Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is 2, stdin contains t-6 test cases, each consisting of three integers n, k, and m, followed by a string s of length m, n is an integer, k is an integer, m is an integer, cnt is 1, s is a string of length m that must have at least 1 character, ss is the first character in the string s, cur_ss is the ASCII value of the first character in the string s minus the ASCII value of 'a', which is a value between 0 and 25 (inclusive), and cur is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `cur` has been reset to 0. All other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-6` test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by a string `s` of length `m`. The values of `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `ss`, and `cur_ss` are still valid and unchanged.
