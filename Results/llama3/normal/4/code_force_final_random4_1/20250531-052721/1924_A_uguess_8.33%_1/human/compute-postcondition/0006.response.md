Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by a string `s` of length `m` that must have at least 1 character, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 1 << cur_ss, `ss` is the first character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. The current value of `cur` has the bit set at the position corresponding to the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a'.**

In this output state, the value of `cur` has been updated to have the bit set at the position corresponding to the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a', which is the position of the first character in the string `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.
