Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each consisting of three integers n, k, and m, followed by a string s of length m, n is an integer, k is an integer, m is an integer, s is a string of length m, cnt is 0, cur is 0
Code of the loop:
for ss in s:
    cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
    if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
        cur += 1 << cur_ss
    if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
        cnt += 1
        cur = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by a string `s` of length `m` that must have at least 1 character, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `cnt` is 1 if `cur` is equal to (1 << k) - 1, otherwise `cnt` remains 0, `ss` is the first character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a', `cur` is either 0 or (1 << k) - 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by a string `s` of length `m` that must have at least 2 characters, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `cnt` is 2 if `cur` was equal to (1 << k) - 1, otherwise `cnt` is 1, `ss` is the second character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the second character in the string `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a', and `cur` is either 0 if `cur` was equal to (1 << k) - 1, or remains unchanged if `cur` was not equal to (1 << k) - 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by a string `s` of length `m` that must have at least 3 characters, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `cnt` is 3 if `cur` was equal to (1 << k) - 1, otherwise `cnt` is 1, `ss` is the third character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the third character in the string `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a', and `cur` is either 0 if `cur` was equal to (1 << k) - 1, or remains unchanged if `cur` was not equal to (1 << k) - 1, and `cur_ss` is now equal to the ASCII value of the third character in the string `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. If `cur` has a bit set at the position corresponding to `cur_ss`, then `cur` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `cur` is updated to `cur` plus 1 shifted to the left by `cur_ss` places.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
