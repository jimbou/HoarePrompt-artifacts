Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each consisting of three integers n, k, and m, followed by a string s of length m, n is an integer, k is an integer, m is an integer, s is a string of length m, cnt is 0, cur is 0**

Explanation: The first line reads three integers from stdin and assigns them to n, k, and m, respectively. Since stdin contains t test cases, after reading one test case, there are t-1 test cases left. The second line reads a string of length m from stdin and assigns it to s. The third line initializes cnt to 0, and the fourth line initializes cur to 0. The values of t and i remain unchanged.
