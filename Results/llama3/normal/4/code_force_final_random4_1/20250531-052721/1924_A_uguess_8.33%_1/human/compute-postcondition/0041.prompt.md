Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each consisting of three integers n, k, and m, followed by a string s of length m, n is an integer, k is an integer, m is an integer, cnt is the number of times the string s contains a substring of length k consisting of distinct characters, ss is the last character in the string s, cur_ss is the ASCII value of the last character in the string s minus the ASCII value of 'a', and cur is either 0 if the last k characters in the string s are distinct, or the bitwise OR of the ASCII values of the last k characters in the string s minus the ASCII value of 'a', shifted to the left by their respective positions. The number of times the string s contains a substring of length k consisting of distinct characters is less than n, 'NO' is printed, tmp is an empty string, and ans is a string of length cnt consisting of the character that is k-1 positions after 'a' in the alphabet.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if cur & 1 << i == 0:
        tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `k` must be at least 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each consisting of three integers n, k, and m, followed by a string s of length m, n is an integer, m is an integer, cnt is the number of times the string s contains a substring of length k consisting of distinct characters, ss is the last character in the string s, cur_ss is the ASCII value of the last character in the string s minus the ASCII value of 'a', and cur is either 0 if the last k characters in the string s are distinct, or the bitwise OR of the ASCII values of the last k characters in the string s minus the ASCII value of 'a', shifted to the left by their respective positions. The number of times the string s contains a substring of length k consisting of distinct characters is less than n, 'NO' is printed, tmp is either an empty string or the character 'a', and ans is a string of length cnt consisting of the character that is k-1 positions after 'a' in the alphabet. If the current value of cur does not have the bit set at position i (i.e., (cur & 1 << i) equals 0), then tmp is set to the character 'a'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `k` must be at least 2, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each consisting of three integers n, k, and m, followed by a string s of length m, n is an integer, m is an integer, cnt is the number of times the string s contains a substring of length k consisting of distinct characters, ss is the last character in the string s, cur_ss is the ASCII value of the last character in the string s minus the ASCII value of 'a', and cur is either 0 if the last k characters in the string s are distinct, or the bitwise OR of the ASCII values of the last k characters in the string s minus the ASCII value of 'a', shifted to the left by their respective positions. The number of times the string s contains a substring of length k consisting of distinct characters is less than n, 'NO' is printed, tmp is either the character 'a' if the current value of cur does not have the bit set at position i, or the character 'b' otherwise, and ans is a string of length cnt consisting of the character that is k-1 positions after 'a' in the alphabet.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `k` must be at least 3, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each consisting of three integers n, k, and m, followed by a string s of length m, n is an integer, m is an integer, cnt is the number of times the string s contains a substring of length k consisting of distinct characters, ss is the last character in the string s, cur_ss is the ASCII value of the last character in the string s minus the ASCII value of 'a', and cur is either 0 if the last k characters in the string s are distinct, or the bitwise OR of the ASCII values of the last k characters in the string s minus the ASCII value of 'a', shifted to the left by their respective positions. The number of times the string s contains a substring of length k consisting of distinct characters is less than n, 'NO' is printed, tmp is either 'a' if the current value of cur does not have the bit set at position i, or 'b' otherwise, and ans is a string of length cnt consisting of the character that is k-1 positions after 'a' in the alphabet.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
