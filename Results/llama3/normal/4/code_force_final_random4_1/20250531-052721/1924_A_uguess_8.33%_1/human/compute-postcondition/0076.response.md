To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `k`. The loop will execute if `k` is at least 1. Since `i` is already 1, we don't need to adjust its state. However, we need to ensure that `k` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, each consisting of three integers n, k, and m, followed by a string s of length m, n is an integer, k must be greater than 0, m is an integer, cnt is an integer that represents the number of times cur equals (1 << k) - 1, ss is the last character in the string s, cur_ss is the ASCII value of the last character in the string s minus the ASCII value of 'a', which is a value between 0 and 25 (inclusive), cur is either 0 or a value that represents the current state of the string s, tmp is an empty string, ans is a string consisting of cnt repetitions of the character that is k-1 positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet, and 'NO' is being printed.**
