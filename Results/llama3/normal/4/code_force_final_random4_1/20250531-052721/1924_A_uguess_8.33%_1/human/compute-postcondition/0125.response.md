To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for i in range(k):`, so we can only adjust the state of `i` and `k`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `k` must be greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `k` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `k` must be greater than 1, stdin contains t-5 test cases, each consisting of three integers n, k, and m, followed by a string s of length m, n is an integer, m is an integer, cnt is an integer less than n, s is a string of length m, ss is the last character in the string s, cur_ss is the ASCII value of the last character in the string s minus the ASCII value of 'a', which is a value between 0 and 25 (inclusive), cur is either 0 or a value between 1 and (1 << k) - 1, tmp is either an empty string or 'a', ans is a string consisting of cnt repetitions of the character 'a' plus k minus 1, and 'NO' is being printed. The current value of cur is either a value where the bit at position i (which is 1) is 0, meaning the second least significant bit of cur is 0, or it is a value where the bit at position i (which is 1) is 1, meaning the second least significant bit of cur is 1.**
