To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(k):`. The only variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `k`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `k` must be greater than 1.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `k`. Since `i` is 2, we need to increment it by 1 to make it 3. Additionally, `k` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables in the state (`t`, `stdin`, `n`, `m`, `cnt`, `ss`, `cur_ss`, `cur`, `tmp`, and `ans`) are not involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 3, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by a string `s` of length `m`, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than 3, `m` is an integer, `cnt` is an integer that represents the number of times `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, `ss` is the last character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the last character in the string `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a', which is a value between 0 and 25 (inclusive), `cur` is either 0 or a value that represents the current state of the string `s`, `tmp` is either 'c' if the bit at position `i` in `cur` is 0, otherwise it is either an empty string or 'b', `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` repetitions of the character that is `k-1` positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet, and 'NO' is being printed.**
