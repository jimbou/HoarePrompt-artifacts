Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases, each consisting of three integers n, k, and m, followed by a string s of length m, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string of length m that must have at least 3 characters, `ss` is the third character in the string s, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the third character in the string s minus the ASCII value of 'a', which is a value between 0 and 25 (inclusive). `cur` is either `cur + 2^cur_ss` or `cur + 1` depending on whether the bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` is 0 or not. If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1 and `cur` is 0. Otherwise, `cnt` is either 0 or 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `cur` has been updated by adding 1 shifted to the left by `cur_ss` places. This means that the bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` has been set to 1. If `cur` was already equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is now 1 and `cur` is now 0. Otherwise, `cnt` remains either 0 or 1, and `cur` remains either `cur + 2^cur_ss` or 0, depending on whether the bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` was 0 or not.
