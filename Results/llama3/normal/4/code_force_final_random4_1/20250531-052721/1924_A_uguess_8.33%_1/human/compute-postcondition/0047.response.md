Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, each consisting of three integers n, k, and m, followed by a string s of length m, n is an integer, k is an integer, m is an integer, cnt is 0, cur is 0, s is a string of length m, ss is the last character in the string s, cur_ss is the ASCII value of the last character in the string s minus the ASCII value of 'a'.**

In this output state, the values of t, i, n, k, and m remain unchanged. The stdin now contains t-3 test cases because two test cases have been consumed by the code. The variables cnt and cur are initialized to 0. The string s is now a string of length m, and ss is the last character in the string s. The variable cur_ss is the ASCII value of the last character in the string s minus the ASCII value of 'a'.
