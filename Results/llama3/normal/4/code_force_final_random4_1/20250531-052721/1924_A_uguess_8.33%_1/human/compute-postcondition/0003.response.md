To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `ss` and the string `s`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If the string `s` has at least 1 character, the loop can execute.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by a string `s` of length `m` that must have at least 1 character, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0, `ss` is the first character in the string `s`**
