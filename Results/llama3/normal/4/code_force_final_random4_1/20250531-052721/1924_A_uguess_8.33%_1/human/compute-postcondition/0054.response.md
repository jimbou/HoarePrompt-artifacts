Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, each consisting of three integers n, k, and m, followed by a string s of length m that must have at least 1 character, n is an integer, k is an integer, m is an integer, cnt is 1, ss is the first character in the string s, cur_ss is the ASCII value of the first character in the string s minus the ASCII value of 'a', which is a value between 0 and 25 (inclusive), cur is 0.**

The code increments the value of `cnt` by 1, making it equal to 1. It then resets the value of `cur` to 0, clearing all bits. No other variables are affected by the code.
