Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by a string `s` of length `m` that must have at least 3 characters, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `cnt` is 2 if `cur` was equal to (1 << k) - 1, otherwise `cnt` is 1, `ss` is the third character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the third character in the string `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a', and `cur` is either 0 if `cur` was equal to (1 << k) - 1, or remains unchanged if `cur` was not equal to (1 << k) - 1, and `cur_ss` is now equal to the ASCII value of the third character in the string `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a', and `cur` is now equal to `cur` plus 1 shifted to the left by `cur_ss` places.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `cur` has been updated by adding 1 shifted to the left by `cur_ss` places. The value of `cur_ss` remains the same, which is the ASCII value of the third character in the string `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. The other variables remain unchanged.
