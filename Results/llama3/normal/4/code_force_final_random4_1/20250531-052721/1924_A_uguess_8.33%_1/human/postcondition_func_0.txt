This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers (n, k, m) and a string s. It then checks if the string s contains at least n substrings of length k, where each substring consists of distinct characters from the first k lowercase English alphabets. If such substrings are found, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' followed by a string that represents the shortest possible completion of s to meet the condition. The function processes all test cases and prints the results accordingly.
