To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved accordingly.

The loop head is `for ss in s:`, where `ss` is the loop variable and `s` is the string being iterated over.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:

* `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive)
* `i` is 0
* `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by a string `s` of length `m` that must have at least 1 character
* `n` is an integer
* `k` is an integer
* `m` is an integer
* `cnt` is 1 if `cur` is equal to (1 << k) - 1, otherwise `cnt` remains 0
* `ss` is the first character in the string `s`
* `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a'
* `cur` is either 0 or (1 << k) - 1

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

* The loop will execute again if there are more characters in the string `s` to iterate over.
* The loop variable `ss` will take on the value of the next character in the string `s`.

Since `ss` is the first character in the string `s` at the end of the previous iteration, we can infer that the next character in the string `s` will be the second character. Therefore, we can adjust the state as follows:

* `ss` is the second character in the string `s`
* `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the second character in the string `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a'
* `cur` remains either 0 or (1 << k) - 1, depending on the value of `cur_ss`

The other variables in the state remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by a string `s` of length `m` that must have at least 2 characters, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `cnt` is 1 if `cur` is equal to (1 << k) - 1, otherwise `cnt` remains 0, `ss` is the second character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the second character in the string `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a', `cur` is either 0 or (1 << k) - 1**
