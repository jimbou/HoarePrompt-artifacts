Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases, each consisting of three integers n, k, and m, followed by a string s of length m, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `cnt` is either 0 or 1, `s` is a string of length m that must have at least 2 characters, `ss` is the second character in the string s, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the second character in the string s minus the ASCII value of 'a', which is a value between 0 and 25 (inclusive), and `cur` is either `cur + 2^cur_ss` or 0.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows: The value of `cur` is updated by adding `2` to the power of `cur_ss` to it. If `cur` becomes equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is set to 1 and `cur` is reset to 0. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
