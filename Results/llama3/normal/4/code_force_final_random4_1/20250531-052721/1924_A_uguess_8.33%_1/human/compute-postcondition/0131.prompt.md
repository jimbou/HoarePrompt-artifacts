Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases, each consisting of three integers n, k, and m, followed by a string s of length m, n is an integer, k is an integer, m is an integer, cnt is an integer less than n, s is a string of length m, ss is the last character in the string s, cur_ss is the ASCII value of the last character in the string s minus the ASCII value of 'a', which is a value between 0 and 25 (inclusive), cur is either 0 or a value between 1 and (1 << k) - 1, tmp is an empty string, ans is a string consisting of cnt repetitions of the character 'a' plus k minus 1, and 'NO' is being printed
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if cur & 1 << i == 0:
        tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0, stdin contains t-5 test cases, each consisting of three integers n, k, and m, followed by a string s of length m, n is an integer, m is an integer, cnt is an integer less than n, s is a string of length m, ss is the last character in the string s, cur_ss is the ASCII value of the last character in the string s minus the ASCII value of 'a', which is a value between 0 and 25 (inclusive), cur is either 0 or a value between 1 and (1 << k) - 1, tmp is either an empty string or 'a', ans is a string consisting of cnt repetitions of the character 'a' plus k minus 1, and 'NO' is being printed. The current value of cur is either a value where the bit at position i (which is 0) is 0, meaning the least significant bit of cur is 0, or it is a value where the bit at position i (which is 0) is 1, meaning the least significant bit of cur is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `k` must be greater than 1, stdin contains t-5 test cases, each consisting of three integers n, k, and m, followed by a string s of length m, n is an integer, m is an integer, cnt is an integer less than n, s is a string of length m, ss is the last character in the string s, cur_ss is the ASCII value of the last character in the string s minus the ASCII value of 'a', which is a value between 0 and 25 (inclusive), cur is either 0 or a value between 1 and (1 << k) - 1, tmp is either 'a' or 'b', ans is a string consisting of cnt repetitions of the character 'a' plus k minus 1, and 'NO' is being printed. The current value of cur is either a value where the bit at position i (which is 1) is 0, meaning the second least significant bit of cur is 0, or it is a value where the bit at position i (which is 1) is 1, meaning the second least significant bit of cur is 1. If the bit at position i of cur is 0, tmp is 'b', otherwise tmp is 'a'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `k` must be greater than 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases, each consisting of three integers n, k, and m, followed by a string s of length m, n is an integer, m is an integer, cnt is an integer less than n, s is a string of length m, ss is the last character in the string s, cur_ss is the ASCII value of the last character in the string s minus the ASCII value of 'a', which is a value between 0 and 25 (inclusive), cur is either 0 or a value between 1 and (1 << k) - 1, tmp is 'c', ans is a string consisting of cnt repetitions of the character 'a' plus k minus 1, and 'NO' is being printed. The current value of cur is either a value where the bit at position i (which is 2) is 0, meaning the third least significant bit of cur is 0, or it is a value where the bit at position i (which is 2) is 1, meaning the third least significant bit of cur is 1. If the bit at position i of cur is 0, tmp is 'c', otherwise tmp is 'c'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
