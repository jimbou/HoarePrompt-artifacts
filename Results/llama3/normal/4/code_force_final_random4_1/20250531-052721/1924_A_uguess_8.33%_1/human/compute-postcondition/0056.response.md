To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for ss in s:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `ss` and `s`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` has at least 2 characters, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has at least 1 character, and `ss` is the first character in the string `s`.

For the loop to execute again, `s` must have at least 2 characters, and `ss` must be the second character in the string `s`. The ASCII value of the second character in the string `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a' is a value between 0 and 25 (inclusive), which is `cur_ss`. The value of `cur` is either 0 or `(1 << k) - 1`, and `cnt` is 1 if `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise `cnt` remains unchanged.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by a string `s` of length `m` that must have at least 2 characters, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `cnt` is 1 if `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise `cnt` remains unchanged, `ss` is the second character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the second character in the string `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a', which is a value between 0 and 25 (inclusive), `cur` is either 0 or `(1 << k) - 1`**
