Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0, stdin contains t-5 test cases, each consisting of three integers n, k, and m, followed by a string s of length m, n is an integer, m is an integer, cnt is an integer less than n, s is a string of length m, ss is the last character in the string s, cur_ss is the ASCII value of the last character in the string s minus the ASCII value of 'a', which is a value between 0 and 25 (inclusive), cur is either 0 or a value between 1 and (1 << k) - 1, tmp is an empty string, ans is a string consisting of cnt repetitions of the character 'a' plus k minus 1, and 'NO' is being printed. The current value of cur is a value where the bit at position i (which is 0) is 0, meaning the least significant bit of cur is 0.**
