Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by a string `s` of length `m` that must have at least 2 characters, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `cnt` is 1 if `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise `cnt` remains unchanged, `ss` is the second character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the second character in the string `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a', which is a value between 0 and 25 (inclusive), `cur` is either 0 or `(1 << k) - 1`**

The code only updates the value of `cur_ss`, which is now equal to the ASCII value of the second character in the string `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `cur_ss` is a value between 0 and 25 (inclusive), since the second character in the string `s` must have at least 2 characters.
