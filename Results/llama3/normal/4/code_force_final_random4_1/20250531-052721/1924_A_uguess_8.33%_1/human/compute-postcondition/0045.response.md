Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by a string `s` of length `m`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `cnt` is the number of times the string `s` contains a substring of length `k` consisting of distinct characters, `ss` is the last character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the last character in the string `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a', and `cur` is either 0 if the last `k` characters in the string `s` are distinct, or the bitwise OR of the ASCII values of the last `k` characters in the string `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a', shifted to the left by their respective positions. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, `i` is set to `k`, `stdin` is empty, and a string `ans` of length `n` is printed, consisting of the character that is `k-1` positions after 'a' in the alphabet, followed by a string `tmp` of length `k` consisting of characters from 'a' to 'a+k-1' in alphabetical order, and then 'a' repeated (`n - cnt - 1`) times.**
