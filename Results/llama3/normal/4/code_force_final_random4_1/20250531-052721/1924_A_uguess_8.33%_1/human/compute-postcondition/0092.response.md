Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases, each consisting of three integers n, k, and m, followed by a string s of length m, n is an integer, k is an integer, m is an integer, cnt is 0, ss is the last character in the string s, cur_ss is the ASCII value of the last character in the string s minus the ASCII value of 'a', which is a value between 0 and 25 (inclusive), cur is 0.**

The code reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m` from stdin, and a string `s` of length `m`. It then initializes `cnt` to 0 and `cur` to 0. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `ss`, and `cur_ss` are not modified by the code. The code does not print anything.
