Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly checks whether all possible strings of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of the given string s.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It first reads the number of test cases t, and then for each test case, it reads the values of n, k, and m, and the string s.

2. It initializes a counter cnt to 0 and a variable cur to 0. The variable cur is used to keep track of the characters in s that have been seen so far. It uses a bitmask to represent the characters, where the i-th bit is set if the i-th character has been seen.

3. It then iterates over the string s. For each character ss in s, it calculates the corresponding bitmask value cur_ss. If the cur_ss-th bit is not set in cur, it sets it and checks if all bits in cur are set (i.e., cur == (1 << k) - 1). If all bits are set, it increments the counter cnt and resets cur to 0.

4. After iterating over the entire string s, it checks if cnt is greater than or equal to n. If it is, it prints 'YES', indicating that all possible strings of length n occur as a subsequence of s.

5. If cnt is less than n, it prints 'NO' and constructs a string ans that does not occur as a subsequence of s. It does this by first appending the character that corresponds to the last set bit in cur (i.e., the last character that was seen in s) to ans, and then appending the character 'a' (i.e., the first character) to ans until its length is n.

6. Finally, it prints the constructed string ans.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
