The code prints a string consisting of cnt repetitions of the character that is k-1 positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet, followed by n - cnt - 1 repetitions of 'a'. Where cnt is the number of times cur equals (1 << k) - 1, k is an integer, n is an integer, and 'a' is the first letter of the alphabet.
Output: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is k, n is an integer, k is an integer, m is an integer, cnt is an integer that represents the number of times cur equals (1 << k) - 1, ss is the last character in the string s, cur_ss is the ASCII value of the last character in the string s minus the ASCII value of 'a', which is a value between 0 and 25 (inclusive), cur is either 0 or a value that represents the current state of the string s, tmp is either an empty string or a character that is k-1 positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet, ans is a string consisting of cnt repetitions of the character that is k-1 positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet, followed by n - cnt - 1 repetitions of 'a', and 'NO' is being printed, stdin contains t-4 test cases, each consisting of three integers n, k, and m, followed by a string s of length m, and this is printed: a string consisting of cnt repetitions of the character that is k-1 positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet, followed by n - cnt - 1 repetitions of 'a'**
