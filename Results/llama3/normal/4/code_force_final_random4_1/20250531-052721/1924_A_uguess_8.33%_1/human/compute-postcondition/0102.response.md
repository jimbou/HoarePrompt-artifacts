Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases, each consisting of three integers n, k, and m, followed by a string s of length m, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `cnt` is 0, `s` is a string of length m that must have at least 2 characters, `ss` is the second character in the string s, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the second character in the string s minus the ASCII value of 'a', which is a value between 0 and 25 (inclusive), and if the bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` is 0, then `cur` is updated to `cur + 2^cur_ss`. If `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1 and `cur` is 0, otherwise `cnt` remains 0.**

The code only updates the value of `cur_ss` by subtracting the ASCII value of 'a' from the ASCII value of the second character in the string `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.
