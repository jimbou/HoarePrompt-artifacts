Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each consisting of three integers n, k, and m, followed by a string s of length m that must have at least 3 characters, n is an integer, k is an integer, m is an integer, cnt is 3, ss is the third character in the string s, cur_ss is the ASCII value of the third character in the string s minus the ASCII value of 'a', and cur is 0.**

In this final state, the value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1, making it 3. The value of `cur` has been reset to 0. All other variables remain unchanged, retaining their initial values and properties as specified in the precondition.
