The only variable in the loop head is variable  ss, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If the string `s` has at least 3 characters the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has at least 2 characters, `ss` is the second character in the string `s`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the string `s` must have at least 3 characters and the `ss` is the third character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the third character in the string `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a', and `cnt` is 2 if `cur` was equal to (1 << k) - 1, otherwise `cnt` is 1, and `cur` is either 0 if `cur` was equal to (1 << k) - 1, or remains unchanged if `cur` was not equal to (1 << k) - 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by a string `s` of length `m` that must have at least 3 characters, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `cnt` is 2 if `cur` was equal to (1 << k) - 1, otherwise `cnt` is 1, `ss` is the third character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the third character in the string `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a', and `cur` is either 0 if `cur` was equal to (1 << k) - 1, or remains unchanged if `cur` was not equal to (1 << k) - 1**
