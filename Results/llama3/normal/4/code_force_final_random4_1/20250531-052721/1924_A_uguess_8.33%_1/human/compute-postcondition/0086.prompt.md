Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, each consisting of three integers n, k, and m, followed by a string s of length m, n is an integer, k is an integer, m is an integer, cnt is an integer that represents the number of times cur equals (1 << k) - 1, ss is the last character in the string s, cur_ss is the ASCII value of the last character in the string s minus the ASCII value of 'a', which is a value between 0 and 25 (inclusive), cur is either 0 or a value that represents the current state of the string s, tmp is an empty string, ans is a string consisting of cnt repetitions of the character that is k-1 positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet, and 'NO' is being printed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if cur & 1 << i == 0:
        tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, each consisting of three integers n, k, and m, followed by a string s of length m, n is an integer, k must be greater than 0, m is an integer, cnt is an integer that represents the number of times cur equals (1 << k) - 1, ss is the last character in the string s, cur_ss is the ASCII value of the last character in the string s minus the ASCII value of 'a', which is a value between 0 and 25 (inclusive), cur is either 0 or a value that represents the current state of the string s, tmp is either an empty string or 'b', ans is a string consisting of cnt repetitions of the character that is k-1 positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet, and 'NO' is being printed. The current value of cur either has or does not have the bit at position i set to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is 2, stdin contains t-3 test cases, each consisting of three integers n, k, and m, followed by a string s of length m, n is an integer, k must be greater than 1, m is an integer, cnt is an integer that represents the number of times cur equals (1 << k) - 1, ss is the last character in the string s, cur_ss is the ASCII value of the last character in the string s minus the ASCII value of 'a', which is a value between 0 and 25 (inclusive), cur is either 0 or a value that represents the current state of the string s, tmp is either 'c' if the bit at position i in cur is 0, otherwise it is either an empty string or 'b', ans is a string consisting of cnt repetitions of the character that is k-1 positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet, and 'NO' is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 3, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by a string `s` of length `m`, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than 3, `m` is an integer, `cnt` is an integer that represents the number of times `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, `ss` is the last character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the last character in the string `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a', which is a value between 0 and 25 (inclusive), `cur` is either 0 or a value that represents the current state of the string `s`, if the bit at position `i` in `cur` is 0, then `tmp` is 'd', otherwise `tmp` is either 'c' if the bit at position `i` in `cur` is 0, otherwise it is either an empty string or 'b', `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` repetitions of the character that is `k-1` positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet, and 'NO' is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
