Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by a string `s` of length `m`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `cnt` is the number of times the string `s` contains a substring of length `k` consisting of distinct characters, `ss` is the last character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the last character in the string `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a', and `cur` is either 0 if the last `k` characters in the string `s` are distinct, or the bitwise OR of the ASCII values of the last `k` characters in the string `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a', shifted to the left by their respective positions.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that `cnt` will store the number of times a substring of length `k` with distinct characters appears in the string `s`. The variable `cur` will store the bitwise OR of the ASCII values of the last `k` characters in the string `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a', shifted to the left by their respective positions, or 0 if the last `k` characters are distinct. The variable `ss` will store the last character in the string `s`, and `cur_ss` will store the ASCII value of the last character in the string `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. The other variables remain unchanged.
