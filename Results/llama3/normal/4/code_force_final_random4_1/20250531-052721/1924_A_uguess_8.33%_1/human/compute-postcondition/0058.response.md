Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by a string `s` of length `m` that must have at least 2 characters, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `cnt` is 1 if `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise `cnt` remains unchanged, `ss` is the second character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the second character in the string `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a', which is a value between 0 and 25 (inclusive), `cur` is either `(1 << cur_ss)` or `(1 << k)`**

The code increments the value of `cur` by shifting 1 to the left by `cur_ss` places. Since `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the second character in the string `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a', which is a value between 0 and 25 (inclusive), the new value of `cur` is either `(1 << cur_ss)` or `(1 << k)`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
