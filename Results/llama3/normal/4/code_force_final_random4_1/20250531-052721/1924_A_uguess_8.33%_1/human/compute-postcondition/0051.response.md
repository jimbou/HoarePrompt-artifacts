The value of `cur` is updated by adding 1 shifted to the left by `cur_ss` places. Since `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the first character in the string `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a', which is a value between 0 and 25 (inclusive), the bit at the position corresponding to `cur_ss` in `cur` is set to 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by a string `s` of length `m` that must have at least 1 character, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is the previous value of `cur` with the bit at the position corresponding to `cur_ss` set to 1, `ss` is the first character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the first character in the string `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a', which is a value between 0 and 25 (inclusive).**
