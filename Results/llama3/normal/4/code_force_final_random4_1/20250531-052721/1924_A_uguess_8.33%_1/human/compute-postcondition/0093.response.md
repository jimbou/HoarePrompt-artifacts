The only variable in the loop head is variable `ss` and `s`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If the string `s` has at least 1 character the loop executes. Before the loop starts, t is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases, each consisting of three integers n, k, and m, followed by a string s of length m, n is an integer, k is an integer, m is an integer, cnt is 0, ss is the last character in the string s, cur_ss is the ASCII value of the last character in the string s minus the ASCII value of 'a', which is a value between 0 and 25 (inclusive), cur is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the string `s` must have at least 1 character and `ss` is the first character in the string `s`.
State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases, each consisting of three integers n, k, and m, followed by a string s of length m, n is an integer, k is an integer, m is an integer, cnt is 0, s is a string of length m that must have at least 1 character, ss is the first character in the string s, cur_ss is the ASCII value of the first character in the string s minus the ASCII value of 'a', which is a value between 0 and 25 (inclusive), cur is 0**
