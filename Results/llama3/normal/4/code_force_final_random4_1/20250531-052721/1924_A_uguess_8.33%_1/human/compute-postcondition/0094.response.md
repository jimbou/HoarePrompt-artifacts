Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases, each consisting of three integers n, k, and m, followed by a string s of length m, n is an integer, k is an integer, m is an integer, cnt is 0, s is a string of length m that must have at least 1 character, ss is the first character in the string s, cur_ss is the ASCII value of the first character in the string s minus the ASCII value of 'a', which is a value between 0 and 25 (inclusive), cur is 0**.

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state because the code only recalculates the value of `cur_ss` which is already defined as the ASCII value of the first character in the string `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. The value of `cur_ss` is still a value between 0 and 25 (inclusive). The values of the other variables are not affected.
