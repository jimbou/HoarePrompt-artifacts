Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, each consisting of three integers n, k, and m, followed by a string s of length m, n is an integer, k is an integer, m is an integer, cnt is 0, cur is 0, s is a string of length m, ss is the last character in the string s, cur_ss is the ASCII value of the last character in the string s minus the ASCII value of 'a'.
Code of the loop:
for ss in s:
    cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
    if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
        cur += 1 << cur_ss
    if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
        cnt += 1
        cur = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by a string `s` of length `m` that must have at least 1 character, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `cnt` is 1 if `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise `cnt` remains unchanged, `ss` is the first character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the first character in the string `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a', which is a value between 0 and 25 (inclusive), `cur` is either 0 or `(1 << k) - 1`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, each consisting of three integers n, k, and m, followed by a string s of length m that must have at least 2 characters, n is an integer, k is an integer, m is an integer, if cur is equal to (1 << k) - 1, then cnt is 2 and cur is 0, otherwise cnt remains 1 and cur remains unchanged, ss is the second character in the string s, cur_ss is the ASCII value of the second character in the string s minus the ASCII value of 'a', which is a value between 0 and 25 (inclusive).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, each consisting of three integers n, k, and m, followed by a string s of length m that must have at least 3 characters, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `ss` is the third character in the string s, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the third character in the string s minus the ASCII value of 'a', which is a value between 0 and 25 (inclusive), and is equal to `ord(ss) - ord('a')`. If the current value `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1 more than its original value, and `cur` is 0. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
