According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is 0, which is less than `k`, so the loop can execute. Therefore, the state of `i` needs to be adjusted to be 0, and the state of `k` needs to be adjusted to be at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `k` must be at least 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each consisting of three integers n, k, and m, followed by a string s of length m, n is an integer, m is an integer, cnt is the number of times the string s contains a substring of length k consisting of distinct characters, ss is the last character in the string s, cur_ss is the ASCII value of the last character in the string s minus the ASCII value of 'a', and cur is either 0 if the last k characters in the string s are distinct, or the bitwise OR of the ASCII values of the last k characters in the string s minus the ASCII value of 'a', shifted to the left by their respective positions. The number of times the string s contains a substring of length k consisting of distinct characters is less than n, 'NO' is printed, tmp is an empty string, and ans is a string of length cnt consisting of the character that is k-1 positions after 'a' in the alphabet.**
