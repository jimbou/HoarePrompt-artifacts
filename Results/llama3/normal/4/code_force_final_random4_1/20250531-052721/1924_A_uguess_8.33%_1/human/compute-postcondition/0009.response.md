Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each consisting of three integers n, k, and m, followed by a string s of length m that must have at least 1 character, n is an integer, k is an integer, m is an integer, cnt is 1, ss is the first character in the string s, cur_ss is the ASCII value of ss minus the ASCII value of 'a', cur is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `cur` has been reset to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
