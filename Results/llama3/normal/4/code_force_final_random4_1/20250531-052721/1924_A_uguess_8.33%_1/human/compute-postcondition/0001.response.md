To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), which already ensures that the loop will execute. However, we need to adjust the state of `i` to be 0, since it will start from 0 in the range.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 0, stdin contains `t` test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by a string `s` of length `m`**
