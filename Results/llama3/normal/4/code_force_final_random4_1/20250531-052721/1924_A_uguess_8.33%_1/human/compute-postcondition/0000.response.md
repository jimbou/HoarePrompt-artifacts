The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that the standard input contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^5) followed by `t` test cases, the value of `t` is now known to be an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive).

The standard input still contains the `t` test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by a string `s` of length `m`. The values of `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by a string `s` of length `m`.**
