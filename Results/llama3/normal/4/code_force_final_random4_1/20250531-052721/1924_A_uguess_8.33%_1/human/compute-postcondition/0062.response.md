The only object in the loop head is variable  ss and string s, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string s.  If the string has at least 3 characters the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, s has at least 2 characters, ss is the second character in the string s, cur_ss is the ASCII value of the second character in the string s minus the ASCII value of 'a', which is a value between 0 and 25 (inclusive). So for the loop to be executed one more time the string must have at least 3 characters and the ss is the third character in the string s and cur_ss is the ASCII value of the third character in the string s minus the ASCII value of 'a', which is a value between 0 and 25 (inclusive).
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, each consisting of three integers n, k, and m, followed by a string s of length m that must have at least 3 characters, n is an integer, k is an integer, m is an integer, if cur is equal to (1 << k) - 1, then cnt is 2 and cur is 0, otherwise cnt remains 1 and cur remains unchanged, ss is the third character in the string s, cur_ss is the ASCII value of the third character in the string s minus the ASCII value of 'a', which is a value between 0 and 25 (inclusive).**
