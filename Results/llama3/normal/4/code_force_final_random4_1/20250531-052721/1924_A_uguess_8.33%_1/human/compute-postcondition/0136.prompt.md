Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by a string `s` of length `m`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, k, m = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    cnt = 0
    cur = 0
    for ss in s:
        cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
        if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
            cur += 1 << cur_ss
        if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
            cnt += 1
            cur = 0
    if cnt >= n:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
        tmp = ''
        ans = chr(ord('a') + k - 1) * cnt
        for i in range(k):
            if cur & 1 << i == 0:
                tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
        ans += tmp
        ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by a string `s` of length `m`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `cnt` is the number of times the string `s` contains a substring of length `k` consisting of distinct characters, `ss` is the last character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the last character in the string `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a', and `cur` is either 0 if the last `k` characters in the string `s` are distinct, or the bitwise OR of the ASCII values of the last `k` characters in the string `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a', shifted to the left by their respective positions. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, `i` is set to `k`, `stdin` is empty, and a string `ans` of length `n` is printed, consisting of the character that is `k-1` positions after 'a' in the alphabet, followed by a string `tmp` of length `k` consisting of characters from 'a' to 'a+k-1' in alphabetical order, and then 'a' repeated (`n - cnt - 1`) times.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, each consisting of three integers n, k, and m, followed by a string s of length m, n is an integer, k is an integer, m is an integer, cnt is an integer that represents the number of times cur equals (1 << k) - 1, ss is the last character in the string s, cur_ss is the ASCII value of the last character in the string s minus the ASCII value of 'a', which is a value between 0 and 25 (inclusive), cur is either 0 or a value that represents the current state of the string s. If cnt is greater than or equal to n, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, i is set to k, tmp is either an empty string or a character that is k-1 positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet, ans is a string consisting of cnt repetitions of the character that is k-1 positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet, followed by n - cnt - 1 repetitions of 'a', and 'NO' is being printed, stdin contains t-4 test cases, each consisting of three integers n, k, and m, followed by a string s of length m, and this is printed: a string consisting of cnt repetitions of the character that is k-1 positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet, followed by n - cnt - 1 repetitions of 'a'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is either 2 or k, stdin contains t-5 test cases, each consisting of three integers n, k, and m, followed by a string s of length m, n is an integer, k is an integer, m is an integer, cnt is an integer, s is a string of length m, ss is the last character in the string s, cur_ss is the ASCII value of the last character in the string s minus the ASCII value of 'a', which is a value between 0 and 25 (inclusive), cur is either 0 or a value between 1 and (1 << k) - 1. If cnt is greater than or equal to n, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, i is set to k, tmp is a string consisting of k characters, where each character is a lowercase letter between 'a' and 'z' (inclusive), ans is a string consisting of cnt repetitions of the character 'a', plus k minus 1 repetitions of tmp, plus n minus cnt minus 1 repetitions of the character 'a', 'NO' is printed, and ans is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
