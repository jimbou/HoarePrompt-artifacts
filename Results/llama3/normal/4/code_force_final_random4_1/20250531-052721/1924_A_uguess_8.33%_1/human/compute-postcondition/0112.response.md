Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases, each consisting of three integers n, k, and m, followed by a string s of length m, n is an integer, k is an integer, m is an integer, s is a string of length m that must have at least 3 characters, ss is the third character in the string s, cur_ss is the ASCII value of the third character in the string s minus the ASCII value of 'a', which is a value between 0 and 25 (inclusive). If cur equals (1 << k) - 1, then cnt is 1 and cur is 0. Otherwise, cnt is either 0 or 1.***
