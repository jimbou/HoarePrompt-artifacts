The code `cur += 1 << cur_ss` increments the value of `cur` by the value of `1 << cur_ss`. The value of `cur_ss` is between 0 and 25 (inclusive), which means the value of `1 << cur_ss` is a power of 2 between 2^0 and 2^25 (inclusive).

Since the bit corresponding to `cur_ss` in the binary representation of `cur` is 0, adding `1 << cur_ss` to `cur` will set this bit to 1.

Therefore, the value of `cur` is updated to `cur + 2^cur_ss`, where `cur_ss` is a value between 0 and 25 (inclusive).

The other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases, each consisting of three integers n, k, and m, followed by a string s of length m, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `cnt` is 0, `s` is a string of length m that must have at least 1 character, `ss` is the first character in the string s, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the first character in the string s minus the ASCII value of 'a', which is a value between 0 and 25 (inclusive), and `cur` is `cur + 2^cur_ss`.**
