Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, each consisting of three integers n, k, and m, followed by a string s of length m that must have at least 3 characters, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `ss` is the third character in the string s, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the third character in the string s minus the ASCII value of 'a', which is a value between 0 and 25 (inclusive), and is equal to `ord(ss) - ord('a')`. If the current value `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1 more than its original value, and `cur` is 0. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
