Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by a string `s` of length `m` that must have at least 2 characters, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `cnt` is 1 if `cur` is equal to (1 << k) - 1, otherwise `cnt` remains 0, `ss` is the second character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the second character in the string `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a', and `cur` is either 1 plus the left shift of 1 by `cur_ss` places or (1 << k) - 1 if `cur` was 0 and `cur_ss` is equal to `k-1`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `cur` has been updated. If `cur` was initially 0, it is now either 1 plus the left shift of 1 by `cur_ss` places or (1 << k) - 1 if `cur_ss` is equal to `k-1`. If `cur` was initially (1 << k) - 1, it remains the same. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
