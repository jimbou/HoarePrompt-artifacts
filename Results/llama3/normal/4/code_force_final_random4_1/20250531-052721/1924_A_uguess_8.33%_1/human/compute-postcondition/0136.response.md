Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is t, stdin is empty, n is an integer, k is an integer, m is an integer, cnt is an integer, s is a string of length m, ss is the last character in the string s, cur_ss is the ASCII value of the last character in the string s minus the ASCII value of 'a', which is a value between 0 and 25 (inclusive), cur is either 0 or a value between 1 and (1 << k) - 1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has processed all the test cases in the input, and the variables `n`, `k`, `m`, `cnt`, `s`, `ss`, `cur_ss`, and `cur` retain their values from the last iteration of the loop. The loop counter `i` is equal to the total number of test cases `t`, and the input stream `stdin` is empty because all the test cases have been processed.
