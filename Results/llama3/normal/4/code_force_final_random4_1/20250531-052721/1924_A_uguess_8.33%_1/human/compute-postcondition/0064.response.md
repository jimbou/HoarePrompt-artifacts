Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, each consisting of three integers n, k, and m, followed by a string s of length m that must have at least 3 characters, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `cur` is either (1 << cur_ss) + cur or (1 << k) - 1, `cnt` is either 1 or 2, `ss` is the third character in the string s, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the third character in the string s minus the ASCII value of 'a', which is a value between 0 and 25 (inclusive), and is equal to `ord(ss) - ord('a')`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cur` is increased by 1 shifted to the left by the value of `cur_ss`, which is the ASCII value of the third character in the string `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The value of `cnt` is either 1 or 2, depending on whether `cur` is equal to (1 << k) - 1 or not.
