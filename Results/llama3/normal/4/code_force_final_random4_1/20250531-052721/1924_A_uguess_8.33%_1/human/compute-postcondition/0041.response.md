Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is `k`, `k` is an integer, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each consisting of three integers n, k, and m, followed by a string s of length m, n is an integer, m is an integer, cnt is the number of times the string s contains a substring of length k consisting of distinct characters, ss is the last character in the string s, cur_ss is the ASCII value of the last character in the string s minus the ASCII value of 'a', and cur is either 0 if the last k characters in the string s are distinct, or the bitwise OR of the ASCII values of the last k characters in the string s minus the ASCII value of 'a', shifted to the left by their respective positions. The number of times the string s contains a substring of length k consisting of distinct characters is less than n, 'NO' is printed, tmp is a string of length k consisting of characters from 'a' to 'a+k-1' in alphabetical order, and ans is a string of length cnt consisting of the character that is k-1 positions after 'a' in the alphabet.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `i` has reached the value of `k`, and `tmp` has become a string of length `k` consisting of characters from 'a' to 'a+k-1' in alphabetical order. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
