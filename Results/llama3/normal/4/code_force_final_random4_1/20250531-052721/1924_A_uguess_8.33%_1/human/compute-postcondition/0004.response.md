Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by a string `s` of length `m` that must have at least 1 character, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0, `ss` is the first character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a'**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `cur_ss` which is assigned the value of the ASCII value of the first character in the string `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. This means that `cur_ss` will be a value between 0 and 25, representing the position of the first character in the alphabet.
