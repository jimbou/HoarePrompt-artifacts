Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is `k`, `k` is an integer, stdin contains `t-5` test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by a string `s` of length `m`, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `cnt` is an integer less than `n`, `s` is a string of length `m`, `ss` is the last character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the last character in the string `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a', which is a value between 0 and 25 (inclusive), `cur` is either 0 or a value between 1 and (1 << `k`) - 1, `tmp` is a string consisting of `k` characters, where each character is a lowercase letter between 'a' and 'z' (inclusive), `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` repetitions of the character 'a' plus `k` minus 1, and 'NO' is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

* The value of `i` has reached `k`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
* The value of `tmp` is now a string consisting of `k` characters, where each character is a lowercase letter between 'a' and 'z' (inclusive). This is because in each iteration, the loop appends a new character to `tmp` based on the value of `cur`.
* The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `cnt`, `s`, `ss`, `cur_ss`, `cur`, and `ans` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop head and body.
* The loop has printed 'NO' to the output.

Note that the exact value of `tmp` depends on the initial value of `cur` and the number of iterations `k`.
