Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `arr`, and `mpp` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. The value of `i` is still 2, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The value of `first` is not affected by the break statement, so its value remains the same as before.
