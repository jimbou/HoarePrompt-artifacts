Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `_` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `i`, `arr`, `mpp`, and `_` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
