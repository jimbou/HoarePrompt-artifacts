Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `_` is 0, `first` is True. If `i` is not a key in `mpp`, the value of `i` which is 1 is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is a key in `mpp` and `mpp[i]` is 1, then `first` is set to True. If `mpp[i]` is 1 and `first` is True, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `first` is now set to True, and all other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
