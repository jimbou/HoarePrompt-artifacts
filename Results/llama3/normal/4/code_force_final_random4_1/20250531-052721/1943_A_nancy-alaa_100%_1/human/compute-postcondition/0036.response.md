Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `first` is True, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. If `mpp[i]` is 1 and `first` is True, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `first` which is set to True. The values of the other variables remain unchanged, and the condition for breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement is still dependent on the value of `mpp[i]` and `first`.
