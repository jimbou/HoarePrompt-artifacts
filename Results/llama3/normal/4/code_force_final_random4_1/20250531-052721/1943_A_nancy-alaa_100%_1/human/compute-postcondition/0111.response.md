Output: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, `_` is 1. If `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution, and the value of `i` which is 2 is being printed**
