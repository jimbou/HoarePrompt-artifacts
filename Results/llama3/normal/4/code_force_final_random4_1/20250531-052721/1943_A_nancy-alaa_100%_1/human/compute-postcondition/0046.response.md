Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `first` is False, `_` is 0. If `i` is not a key in `mpp`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
