To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved in it.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The objects involved in the loop head are `_` and `input()`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 0, and `input()` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.

For the loop to execute again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `input()` needs to contain one less test case.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, `_` is 1, `first` is True if there exists a key `k` in `mpp` such that `mpp[k]` is 1, otherwise `first` is False.**
