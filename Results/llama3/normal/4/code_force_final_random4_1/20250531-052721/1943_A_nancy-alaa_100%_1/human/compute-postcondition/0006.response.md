Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `first` is False, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code `break` causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional statement it is currently inside. The values of the variables `n`, `arr`, `mpp`, `first`, `_`, and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. The only change is that the program breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement it was directly inside.
