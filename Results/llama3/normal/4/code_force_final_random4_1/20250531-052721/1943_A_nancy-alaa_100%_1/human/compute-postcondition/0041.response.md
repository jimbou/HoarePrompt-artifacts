According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is an integer greater than 0, arr is a list of integers, mpp is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in arr, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, i is n, first is False, _ is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `first` is False, `_` is 0**
