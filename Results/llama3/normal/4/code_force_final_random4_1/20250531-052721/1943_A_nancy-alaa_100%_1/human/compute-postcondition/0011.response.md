Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `first` is True, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `arr`, `mpp`, `first`, and `_` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, which means we exit the current loop or if statement and move on to the next part of the code.
