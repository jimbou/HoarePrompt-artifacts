Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. The current value of `mpp[i]` is 1, and if `i` is a key in `mpp` and `first` is False, then `first` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
