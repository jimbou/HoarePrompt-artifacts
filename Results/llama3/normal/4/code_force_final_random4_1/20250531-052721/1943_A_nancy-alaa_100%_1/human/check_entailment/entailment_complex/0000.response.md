Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the final score of a game played between Alice and Bob. The game involves picking elements from an array and appending them to another array, with the goal of maximizing or minimizing the MEX (minimum excludant) of the resulting array.

The program uses a Counter object from the collections module to count the frequency of each element in the input array. It then iterates over the range of possible MEX values (from 0 to n+1) and checks if each value is present in the Counter object. If a value is not present, it means that the MEX is equal to that value, and the program prints it. If a value is present but has a frequency of 1, it means that the MEX is equal to that value if and only if there is another value with a frequency of 1 that has not been encountered yet. The program uses a boolean variable `first` to keep track of whether such a value has been encountered.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the correct output for all valid inputs. The use of the Counter object and the iteration over the range of possible MEX values makes the program efficient and easy to understand.

Correctness: **True**
