Output: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 2. If `i` is a key in `mpp` and `mpp[i]` is 1, then `first` is True. Otherwise, `first` remains unchanged, and the value of `i` which is 2 is being printed**
