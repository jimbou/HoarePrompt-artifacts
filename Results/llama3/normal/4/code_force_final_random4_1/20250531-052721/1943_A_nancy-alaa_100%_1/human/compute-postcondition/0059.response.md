Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `_` is 0. If `i` is not a key in `mpp`, the value of `i` which is 1 is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is a key in `mpp` and `mpp[i]` is 1, then `first` is set to True. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
