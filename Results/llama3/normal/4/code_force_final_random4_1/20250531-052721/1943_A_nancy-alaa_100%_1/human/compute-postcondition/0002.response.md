To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. Since `n` is already an integer greater than 0, we can focus on `i`. For the loop to execute, `i` should start from 0.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `first` is False, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 0**
