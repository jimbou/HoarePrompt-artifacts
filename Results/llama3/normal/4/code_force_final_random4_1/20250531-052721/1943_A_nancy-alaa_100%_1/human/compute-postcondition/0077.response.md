Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `_` is 0, `first` is True if there exists a key `k` in `mpp` such that `mpp[k]` is 1, otherwise `first` is False.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `n`, and the value of `first` will be True if there exists a key `k` in `mpp` such that `mpp[k]` is 1, otherwise `first` will be False. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
