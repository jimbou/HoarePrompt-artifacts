Output State: **`n` is at least 0, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, `_` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `i`, `arr`, `mpp`, `stdin`, and `_` remain unchanged because the code only contains a `break` statement, which does not modify any variables. The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is directly inside, but it does not affect the values of the variables.
