Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, arr is a list of integers, mpp is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in arr, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, i is n, first is False, _ is 0**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `n` is updated to an integer greater than 0, which is read from the input. The list `arr` now contains a new set of integers, also read from the input. The dictionary `mpp` is updated to contain the frequency of each integer in the new `arr`. The input buffer `stdin` now contains one less input, as two inputs have been read. The variable `i` still holds the value of `n`. The boolean variable `first` is set to `False`. The variable `_` remains unchanged at 0.
