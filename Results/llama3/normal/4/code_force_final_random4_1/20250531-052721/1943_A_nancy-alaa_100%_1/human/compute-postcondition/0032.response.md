The code prints the value of `i` which is a key in the dictionary `mpp` containing the frequency of each integer in the list `arr`. Since `i` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we can't determine its exact value. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the value of `i` which is a key in the dictionary `mpp`.
Output: **i (where i is a key in the dictionary mpp containing the frequency of each integer in the list arr)**
