Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. If `i` is not a key in `mpp`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
