Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `_` is 0. If `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
