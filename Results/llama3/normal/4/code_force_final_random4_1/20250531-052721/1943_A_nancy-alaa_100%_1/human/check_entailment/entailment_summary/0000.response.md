Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It uses a Counter object from the collections module to count the frequency of each element in the input list. It then iterates over the range from 0 to n (inclusive), where n is the length of the input list. For each number i in this range, it checks if i is not present in the Counter object or if its count is 1 and a flag 'first' is True. If either condition is met, it prints i and breaks the loop. If no such number is found, it prints the smallest positive integer greater than n.

The logic behind this program is as follows:

- If a number i is not present in the Counter object, it means that i is not present in the input list. In this case, i is the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the list, so it is the MEX of the list.

- If a number i has a count of 1 in the Counter object and the flag 'first' is True, it means that i appears only once in the input list and Alice has already picked a number that appears only once. In this case, i is the smallest positive integer that appears only once in the list, so it is the MEX of the list.

- If no such number is found, it means that all numbers from 0 to n are present in the input list. In this case, the smallest positive integer greater than n is the MEX of the list.

Correctness: **True**
