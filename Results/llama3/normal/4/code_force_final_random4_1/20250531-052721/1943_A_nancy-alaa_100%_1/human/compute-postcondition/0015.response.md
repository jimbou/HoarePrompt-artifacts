Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. If `i` is a key in `mpp` and `mpp[i]` is 1, then `first` is set to True. Otherwise, `first` remains unchanged.***
