Postcondition: **`n` is at least 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, `_` is 1. The current value of `mpp[i]` is 1. If `first` was True, then `first` is still True and the program has broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution.**
