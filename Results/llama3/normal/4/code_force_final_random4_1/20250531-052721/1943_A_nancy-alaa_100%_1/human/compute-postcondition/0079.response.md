Output State: **n is an integer, i is n, arr is a list of integers, mpp is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in arr, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, _ is 1, first is False**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to an integer value read from the input. The value of `i` is still equal to `n`. The list `arr` now contains a new set of integers read from the input. The dictionary `mpp` has been updated to contain the frequency of each integer in the new list `arr`. The variable `first` has been set to `False`, indicating that there is no key `k` in `mpp` such that `mpp[k]` is 1. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 1. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs.
