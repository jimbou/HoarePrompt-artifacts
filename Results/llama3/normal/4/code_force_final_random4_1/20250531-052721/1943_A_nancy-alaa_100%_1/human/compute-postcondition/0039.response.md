The only variable in the loop head is the variable `_`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and the range of `int(input())`. If `_` is less than `int(input())`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is not defined, `int(input())` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be 0 and `int(input())` must be greater than 0.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs, `i` is `n`, `first` is True, `_` is 0**
