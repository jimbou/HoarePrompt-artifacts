Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `_` is 0. If `i` is a key in `mpp` and `mpp[i]` is 1 and `first` is True, then `first` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
