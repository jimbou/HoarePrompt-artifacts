This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains a list of integers. It then finds and prints the smallest positive integer that is either missing from the list or appears only once, if such an integer exists. If no such integer is found, it prints the smallest positive integer that is greater than the length of the list. The function processes all test cases and prints the result for each case.
