Output State: **`n` is at least 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, `_` is 1, `first` is True, and if `first` was True before, the program has broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their initial values, and an additional variable `first` is introduced and set to True. If `first` was already True before, the program has exited the innermost loop or if statement, otherwise, the program continues executing.
