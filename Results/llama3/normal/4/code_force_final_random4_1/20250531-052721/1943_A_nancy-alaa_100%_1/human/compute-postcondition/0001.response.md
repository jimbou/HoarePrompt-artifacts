Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, arr is a list of integers, mpp is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in arr, first is False, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs**.

In this output state, the value of `n` is an integer greater than 0, which is the value obtained from the first input. The variable `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the second input. The dictionary `mpp` contains the frequency of each integer in the list `arr`. The variable `first` is set to False. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, as two inputs have been consumed by the code.
