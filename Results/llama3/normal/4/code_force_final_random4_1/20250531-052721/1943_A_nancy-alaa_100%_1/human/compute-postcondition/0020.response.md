Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 1, `first` is True if `i` is a key in `mpp` and `mpp[i]` is 1, otherwise `first` is unchanged. If `i` is not a key in `mpp`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
