Output State: **`n` is at least 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, `_` is 1, `first` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, except that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The current value of `i` is still not a key in the dictionary `mpp`, and the value of `i` which is 0 is still being printed.
