Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `_` is 0, if `i` is a key in `mpp` and `mpp[i]` is 1, then `first` is set to True, otherwise the state of the variables remains unchanged, and the value of `i` which is 1 is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the value of `n`, `i`, `arr`, `mpp`, `stdin`, and `_` remains unchanged. The state of `first` is set to True if `i` is a key in `mpp` and `mpp[i]` is 1, otherwise it remains unchanged. The value of `i` which is 1 is being printed. Also, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
