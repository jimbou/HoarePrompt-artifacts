Output State: **`n` is at least 0, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `stdin` contains no test cases, `_` is the number of test cases minus 1, `first` is True if there exists a key `k` in `mpp` such that `mpp[k]` is 1, otherwise `first` is False.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed for all test cases in the input. The loop counter `_` has reached the total number of test cases minus 1, and the input buffer `stdin` is empty. The variables `n`, `i`, `arr`, and `mpp` retain their values from the last iteration of the loop. The variable `first` is set to True if there is at least one integer in the array that appears only once, and False otherwise.
