Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 1, `first` is True if `i` is a key in `mpp` and `mpp[i]` is 1, otherwise `first` is unchanged. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the value of `i` which is 1 is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state is that the values of `n`, `arr`, `mpp`, `stdin`, `i`, and `first` remain unchanged. However, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the value of `i` (which is 1) is being printed.
