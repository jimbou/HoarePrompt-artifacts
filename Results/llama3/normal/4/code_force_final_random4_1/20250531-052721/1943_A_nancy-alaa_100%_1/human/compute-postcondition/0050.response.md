Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `first` is True, `_` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. The current value of `i` is still a key in `mpp` and the frequency of `i` in `arr` is still 1, and the value of `i` which is 0 is still being printed.
