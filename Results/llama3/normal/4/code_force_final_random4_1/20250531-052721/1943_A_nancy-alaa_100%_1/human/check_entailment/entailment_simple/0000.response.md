Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

2. It uses a `Counter` object `mpp` to count the frequency of each integer in the list `arr`. This is an efficient way to keep track of the frequency of each integer.

3. The program then iterates over the range `n + 1` (i.e., from 0 to `n`). For each integer `i` in this range, it checks if `i` is not present in the `mpp` dictionary (i.e., its frequency is 0). If it finds such an `i`, it prints `i` and breaks out of the loop. This is because the MEX of the array `c` is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in `c`, and since Alice wants to maximize the score, she will try to include all smaller integers in `c`.

4. If the program doesn't find an `i` that is not present in `mpp`, it means that all integers from 0 to `n` are present in `arr`. In this case, the program checks if there is an integer `i` that has a frequency of 1 in `mpp` and if `first` is `True`. If it finds such an `i`, it prints `i` and breaks out of the loop. This is because if there is an integer with a frequency of 1, Alice can include it in `c` and Bob cannot remove it, so the MEX of `c` will be this integer.

5. If the program doesn't find an `i` with a frequency of 1 and `first` is `True`, it means that all integers from 0 to `n` have a frequency of at least 2 in `arr`. In this case, the program will not print anything, which is correct because the MEX of `c` will be `n + 1`, which is not included in the range `n + 1` that the program iterates over.

6. The program uses a flag `first` to keep track of whether it has found an integer with a frequency of 1. This is necessary because if there are multiple integers with a frequency of 1, Alice will include the smallest one in `c` to maximize the score.

Correctness: **True**
