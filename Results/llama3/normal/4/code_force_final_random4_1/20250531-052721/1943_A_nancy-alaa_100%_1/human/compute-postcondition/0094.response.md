To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is at least 0.

To make the loop execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `n` remains the same, which is at least 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is at least 0, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, `_` is 1. If `mpp[i]` is 1 and `first` is True, then the program has broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution.**
