Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, `_` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `i`, `arr`, `mpp`, and `_` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement due to the `break` statement.
