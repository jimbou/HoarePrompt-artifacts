Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program is correct because it accurately implements the optimal strategy for Alice to maximize the score of the game. The program uses a Counter to count the occurrences of each number in the array, and then iterates through the numbers from 0 to n to find the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array or occurs only once. This is the optimal strategy for Alice because she wants to maximize the MEX of her array, and by choosing the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array or occurs only once, she ensures that the MEX of her array is maximized.

The program also correctly handles the case where the array contains duplicate numbers. In this case, Alice's optimal strategy is to choose the smallest non-negative integer that occurs only once in the array, because this ensures that the MEX of her array is maximized.

The program also correctly handles the case where the array does not contain any duplicate numbers. In this case, Alice's optimal strategy is to choose the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array, because this ensures that the MEX of her array is maximized.

Overall, the program correctly implements the optimal strategy for Alice to maximize the score of the game, and it handles all possible cases correctly.
