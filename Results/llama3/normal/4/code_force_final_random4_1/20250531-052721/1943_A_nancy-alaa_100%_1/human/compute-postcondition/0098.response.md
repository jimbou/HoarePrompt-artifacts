Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 0, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, `_` is 1. If `i` is not a key in `mpp`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution.***
