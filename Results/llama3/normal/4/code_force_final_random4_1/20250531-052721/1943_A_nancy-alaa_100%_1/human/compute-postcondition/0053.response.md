Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `_` is 0, `first` is True, and the current value of `mpp[i]` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state with the addition of a new variable `first` which is set to True. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
