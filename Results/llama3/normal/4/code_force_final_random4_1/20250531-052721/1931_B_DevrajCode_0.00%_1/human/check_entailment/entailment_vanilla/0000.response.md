Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first reads the input data, which includes the number of test cases (n) and the amounts of water in each container (a).

2. The program then defines a function `func_1(n, a)` that takes the number of containers (n) and the amounts of water in each container (a) as input.

3. Inside the function, the program calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by the number of containers (n). If it is not, the function returns 'No' because it is impossible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

4. If the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers, the program calculates the target amount of water that each container should have.

5. The program then iterates over the amounts of water in each container. For each container, it calculates the difference between the current amount of water and the target amount. This difference is added to a variable `container`.

6. If the `container` variable ever becomes negative, the function returns 'No' because it means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to fill the current container to the target amount.

7. If the program iterates over all containers without the `container` variable becoming negative, the function returns 'Yes' because it means that it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

Based on this analysis, the program's logic is correct and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
