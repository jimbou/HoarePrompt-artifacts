The code assigns the value of `total_water // n` to `target`. Since `total_water` is divisible by `n`, `target` becomes an integer equal to the quotient of `total_water` divided by `n`. The second line assigns the value of `0` to `container`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of non-negative integers such that the sum of a is divisible by n, total_water is the sum of a which is divisible by n, target is an integer equal to the quotient of total_water divided by n, and container is 0**
