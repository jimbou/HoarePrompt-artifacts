Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, `total_water` is the sum of `a` which is divisible by `n`, `target` is an integer equal to the quotient of `total_water` divided by `n`, `container` is `a[1] - target + a[1] - target`, `water` is the second element in the list `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `container` has been updated by adding the difference between the second element in the list `a` and the target value to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged.
