Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `total_water` is the sum of `a` which is divisible by `n`, `target` is an integer equal to the quotient of `total_water` divided by `n`, `container` is `a[0] - target`, `water` is the first element in the list `a`.**

The code increments the value of `container` by the difference between `water` (which is the first element in the list `a`) and `target` (which is the quotient of `total_water` divided by `n`). The values of the other variables are not affected. The list `a` still has at least one element, and `total_water` is still the sum of `a` and is divisible by `n`. The value of `n` is still a positive integer.
