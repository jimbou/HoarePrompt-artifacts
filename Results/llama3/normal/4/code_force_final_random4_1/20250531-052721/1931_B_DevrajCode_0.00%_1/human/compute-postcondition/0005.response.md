To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `water` and `a`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If `a` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Since `a` is a list of non-negative integers and the sum of `a` is divisible by `n`, we can conclude that `a` must have at least 1 element.

For the loop to execute, `water` should be the first element in the list `a`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `total_water` is the sum of `a` which is divisible by `n`, `target` is an integer equal to the quotient of `total_water` divided by `n`, `container` is 0, `water` is the first element in the list `a`**
