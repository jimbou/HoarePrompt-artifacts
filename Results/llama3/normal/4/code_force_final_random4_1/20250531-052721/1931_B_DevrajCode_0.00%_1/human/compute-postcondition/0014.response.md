To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `water` and `a`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more elements in the list `a`. At the end of the previous iteration, `water` is the second element in the list `a`, and `a` has at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute again, `a` must have at least 3 elements, and `water` must be the third element in the list `a`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 3 elements, `total_water` is the sum of `a` divisible by `n`, `target` is the quotient of `total_water` divided by `n`, and `water` is the third element in the list `a`.**
