To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for water in a:`. Therefore, we can only adjust the states of `water` and `a`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `a` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, and `water` is the first element in the list `a`. For the loop to execute again, `a` must have at least 2 elements, and `water` must be the second element in the list `a`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, `total_water` is the sum of `a` which is divisible by `n`, `target` is an integer equal to the quotient of `total_water` divided by `n`, `container` is `a[1] - target`, `water` is the second element in the list `a`. The container is larger than or equal to 0**
