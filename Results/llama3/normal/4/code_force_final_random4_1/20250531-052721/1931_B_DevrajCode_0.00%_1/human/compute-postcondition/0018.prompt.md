Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, a is a list of non-negative integers such that the sum of a is divisible by n, total_water is the sum of a which is divisible by n, target is an integer equal to the quotient of total_water divided by n, and container is 0
Code of the loop:
for water in a:
    container += water - target
    if container < 0:
        return 'No'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `total_water` is the sum of `a` which is divisible by `n`, `target` is an integer equal to the quotient of `total_water` divided by `n`, `container` is `a[0] - target`, `water` is the first element in the list `a`. The container is larger than or equal to 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The program either returns the string 'No' if the calculated container value is negative, otherwise it continues execution with the existing values of `n`, `a`, `total_water`, `target`, `container`, and `water`, where `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 2 elements, `total_water` is the sum of `a` divisible by `n`, `target` is the quotient of `total_water` divided by `n`, and `water` is the second element in the list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 3 elements, `total_water` is the sum of `a` divisible by `n`, `target` is the quotient of `total_water` divided by `n`, `water` is the third element in the list `a`. If the difference between `water` and `target` is negative, the program returns the string 'No'. Otherwise, the program continues execution.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
