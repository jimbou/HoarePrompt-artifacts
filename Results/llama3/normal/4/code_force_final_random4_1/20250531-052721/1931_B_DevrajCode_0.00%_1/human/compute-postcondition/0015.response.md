Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 3 elements, `total_water` is the sum of `a` divisible by `n`, `target` is the quotient of `total_water` divided by `n`, `water` is the third element in the list `a`, and `container` is increased by the difference between `water` and `target`.**

In this output state, the value of `container` has been updated by adding the difference between `water` and `target`. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and relationships.
