Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of non-negative integers such that the sum of `a` is divisible by `n`, `total_water` is the sum of `a` which is divisible by `n`**

In this output state, the value of `total_water` is equal to the sum of the list `a`, which is divisible by `n` as per the initial state. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged.
