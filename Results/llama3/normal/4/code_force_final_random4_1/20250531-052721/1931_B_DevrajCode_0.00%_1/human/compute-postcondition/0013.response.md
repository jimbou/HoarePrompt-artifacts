Postcondition: **The program either returns the string 'No' if the calculated container value is negative, otherwise it continues execution with the existing values of `n`, `a`, `total_water`, `target`, `container`, and `water`, where `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 2 elements, `total_water` is the sum of `a` divisible by `n`, `target` is the quotient of `total_water` divided by `n`, and `water` is the second element in the list `a`.**
