Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

The program first calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by the number of containers. If not, it immediately returns 'No'. Otherwise, it calculates the target amount of water each container should have.

Then, it iterates over the amounts of water in the containers, keeping track of the difference between the current amount and the target amount. If at any point this difference becomes negative, it means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to fill the current container to the target amount, so it returns 'No'.

If the program finishes iterating over the containers without returning 'No', it means that it is possible to distribute the water evenly, so it returns 'Yes'.

Correctness: **True**
