Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program first checks if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers. If it's not, the program returns 'No', which is correct because it's impossible to distribute the water evenly among the containers.

2. If the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers, the program calculates the target amount of water each container should have.

3. The program then iterates over the list of water amounts. For each amount, it calculates the difference between the current amount and the target amount, and adds this difference to the `container` variable.

4. If at any point the `container` variable becomes negative, the program returns 'No'. This is correct because it means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to fill the current container to the target amount.

5. If the program finishes iterating over the list of water amounts without the `container` variable becoming negative, it returns 'Yes'. This is correct because it means that it is possible to distribute the water evenly among the containers by pouring water from the previous containers to the current container.

6. The program correctly handles the case where the number of containers is 1, in which case it is always possible to distribute the water evenly.

7. The program also correctly handles the case where the total amount of water is 0, in which case it is always possible to distribute the water evenly.

Therefore, the program is correct and will always return the correct result.

Correctness: **True**
