Output State: **The program either returns the string 'No' if the calculated container value is negative at any point during the loop execution, or it continues execution until the end of the loop with the final values of `n`, `a`, `total_water`, `target`, and `container`, where `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of non-negative integers, `total_water` is the sum of `a` divisible by `n`, `target` is the quotient of `total_water` divided by `n`, and `container` is the final value after all iterations.**

In natural language, this means that the program will either terminate early and return 'No' if at any point during the loop the calculated container value becomes negative, or it will complete all iterations of the loop and end with the final values of the variables `n`, `a`, `total_water`, `target`, and `container`, where `n` remains a positive integer, `a` remains a list of non-negative integers, `total_water` remains the sum of `a` divisible by `n`, `target` remains the quotient of `total_water` divided by `n`, and `container` holds the final value after all iterations.
