Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 3 elements, `total_water` is the sum of `a` divisible by `n`, `target` is the quotient of `total_water` divided by `n`, `water` is the third element in the list `a`. If the difference between `water` and `target` is negative, the program returns the string 'No'. Otherwise, the program continues execution.***
