Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `total_water` is the sum of `a` which is divisible by `n`, `target` is an integer equal to the quotient of `total_water` divided by `n`. The current value of `container` is less than 0, and the current value of `water` is the first element in the list `a`.**
