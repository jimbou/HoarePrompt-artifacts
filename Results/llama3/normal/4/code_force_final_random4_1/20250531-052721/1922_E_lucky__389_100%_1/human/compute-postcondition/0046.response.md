Postcondition: **`x` is greater than or equal to 2 to the power of `i`, `subseq_lens` is a list, `mx` is an integer, `i` is the smallest integer such that 2 to the power of `i` is greater than `x`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers. The current value of `i` is 0.**
