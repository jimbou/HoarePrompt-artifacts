Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding an array of integers with exactly X increasing subsequences. The program works by repeatedly subtracting the largest power of 2 less than or equal to the current number from the input number X, and constructing a list of integers based on the powers of 2 subtracted.

The program correctly handles the case where X is 2, printing 1 and 0 as required. For other values of X, the program constructs a list of integers from 0 to the maximum power of 2 minus 1, and appends all elements of the processed list except the first one. This approach ensures that the resulting list has exactly X increasing subsequences.

The program also correctly prints the length of the resulting list and its elements, as required by the problem statement.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and execution summary, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
