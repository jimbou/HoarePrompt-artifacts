Output State: **`x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list of integers, `mx` is an integer, `i` is equal to the length of `ansv`, `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx-1` and also includes all elements of `subseq_lens` except the first one at the end, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers, and all elements of the list `ansv` are printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that all elements of the list `ansv` are printed, and the loop counter `i` is equal to the length of `ansv`. The other variables remain unchanged.
