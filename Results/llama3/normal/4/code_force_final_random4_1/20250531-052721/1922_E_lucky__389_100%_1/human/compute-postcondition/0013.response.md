The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` was 1, so the new value of `i` is 2. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains a space-separated list of integers.

Output State: **`x` is an integer between 3 and 1000, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, `i` is 2, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers.**
