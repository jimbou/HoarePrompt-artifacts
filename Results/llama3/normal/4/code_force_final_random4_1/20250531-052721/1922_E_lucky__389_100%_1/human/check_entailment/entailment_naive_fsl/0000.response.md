Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when the input X is 3. The program should output an array with exactly 3 increasing subsequences, but the program outputs an array with 2 increasing subsequences: [0] and [0, 1]. The correct output for X = 3 should be an array with 3 increasing subsequences, such as [0, 1, 0].

The issue with the program is that it does not correctly handle the case when X is a power of 2 minus 1. In this case, the program should output an array with exactly X increasing subsequences, but the program outputs an array with X-1 increasing subsequences.
