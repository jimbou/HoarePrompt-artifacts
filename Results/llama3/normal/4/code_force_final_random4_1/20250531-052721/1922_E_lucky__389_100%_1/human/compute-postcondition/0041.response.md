The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` was 1, so the new value of `i` is 2. The values of the other variables are not affected. We are still breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. The stdin still contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers. 
Output State: **`x` is greater than or equal to 2 to the power of 2, `subseq_lens` is a list, `mx` is an integer, `i` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers**
