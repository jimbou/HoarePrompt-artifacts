Output State: **x is an integer between 1 and 1000, subseq_lens is an empty list, mx is 0, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers.**

Explanation: The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `x`. Since the input is between 1 and 1000, `x` becomes an integer in this range. The second line initializes an empty list `subseq_lens`. The third line initializes `mx` to 0. No other variables are affected. The stdin now contains only one input, which is a space-separated list of integers.
