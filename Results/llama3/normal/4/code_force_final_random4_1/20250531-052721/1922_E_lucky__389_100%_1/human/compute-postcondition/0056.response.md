Output State: **`x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `mx` is an integer, `i` is 2, `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx-1` and also includes the second and third elements of `subseq_lens` at the end, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers.**

In this output state, the value of `ansv` has been updated to include the third element of `subseq_lens` at the end, in addition to the second element that was already included. The other variables remain unchanged.
