Output State: **`x` is greater than or equal to 2 to the power of `i`, `subseq_lens` is a list, `mx` is an integer, `i` is the smallest integer such that 2 to the power of `i` is greater than `x`, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers**

In natural language, this output state means that the loop will continue to execute until `i` is the smallest integer such that 2 to the power of `i` is greater than `x`. At this point, the loop will terminate, and the final values of `x`, `subseq_lens`, `mx`, and `i` will be as described above.
