Functionality: **This function reads an integer and a list of integers from standard input, processes the list by repeatedly subtracting the largest power of 2 less than or equal to the current number, and prints the length of the resulting list and its elements. If the input integer is 2, it prints 1 and 0 and returns without processing the list. Otherwise, it constructs a list of integers from 0 to the maximum power of 2 minus 1 and appends all elements of the processed list except the first one, then prints the length of this list and its elements.**
