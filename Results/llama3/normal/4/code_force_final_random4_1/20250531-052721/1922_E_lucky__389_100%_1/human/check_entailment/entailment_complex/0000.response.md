Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find an array of integers with exactly X increasing subsequences. The program uses a greedy approach to construct the array by repeatedly subtracting the largest power of 2 less than or equal to the current number. This approach ensures that the resulting array has the minimum possible length.

The program also correctly handles the case where the input integer is 2, in which case it prints 1 and 0 and returns without processing the list.

The program's output is also correct. It prints the length of the resulting array and its elements, which is the expected output format.

The program's logic is also correct. It constructs a list of integers from 0 to the maximum power of 2 minus 1 and appends all elements of the processed list except the first one. This ensures that the resulting array has exactly X increasing subsequences.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
