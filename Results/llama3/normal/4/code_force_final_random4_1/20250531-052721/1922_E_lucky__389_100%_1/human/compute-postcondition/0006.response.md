Output State: **The program returns nothing, as the return statement is empty. The values of the variables remain unchanged: x is still an integer equal to 2, subseq_lens is still an empty list, and mx is still 0. The input from stdin has been read, but its value is not used in the program. The output of the program is still 1, and the printed value is still 0.**
