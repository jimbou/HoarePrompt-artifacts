Output State: **x is an integer between -1 and 999, subseq_lens is a list containing a single integer i - 1, mx is the maximum of 0 and i - 1, i is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(x) + 1 and larger than 0, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers.**

In this output state, the value of x has been reduced by 2 to the power of i - 1, which is a positive integer. The list subseq_lens now contains a single integer i - 1, which is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(x) + 1 and larger than 0. The value of mx has been updated to be the maximum of its original value (0) and i - 1. The value of i remains the same, as it is not modified by the code. The state of stdin remains unchanged, as no input is read or modified by the code.
