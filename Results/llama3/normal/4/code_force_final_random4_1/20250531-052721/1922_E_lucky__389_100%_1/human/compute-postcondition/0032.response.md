Output State: **`x` is greater than or equal to 2 to the power of `i`, `subseq_lens` is a list, `mx` is an integer, `i` is 0 and is the smallest integer such that 2 to the power of `i` is greater than `x`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `x`, `subseq_lens`, `mx`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The stdin still contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers.
