Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer between 1 and 1000, but not equal to 2, `subseq_lens` is a list, `mx` is an integer, `i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(x) + 1, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers. If `i` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `subseq_lens` contains a single integer `i - 1`, `mx` is the maximum of 0 and `i - 1`, and `i` is larger than 0.***
