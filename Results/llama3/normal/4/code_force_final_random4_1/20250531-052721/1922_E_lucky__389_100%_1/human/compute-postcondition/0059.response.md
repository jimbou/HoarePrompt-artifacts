Output State: **`x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list of integers, `mx` is an integer, `i` is equal to the length of `subseq_lens`, `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx-1` and also includes all elements of `subseq_lens` except the first one at the end, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `x` remains 0, the list `subseq_lens` remains unchanged, the value of `mx` remains the same, the value of `i` becomes equal to the length of `subseq_lens`, the list `ansv` includes all integers from 0 to `mx-1` and also includes all elements of `subseq_lens` except the first one at the end, and the input in stdin remains the same.
