The only variable in the loop head is variable i and x, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i and x.  If 2 ** i is less than or equal to x, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is 1 and x is not equal to 0, So for the loop to be executed one more time i must be 1 and x must be greater than or equal to 2.
State: **`x` is greater than or equal to 2, `subseq_lens` is a list, `mx` is an integer, `i` is 1, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers**
