Output State: **`x` is greater than or equal to 2 to the power of 3, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, `i` is 3, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 3. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains a space-separated list of integers as input.
