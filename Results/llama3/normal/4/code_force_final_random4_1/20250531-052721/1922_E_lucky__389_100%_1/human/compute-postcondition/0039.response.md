The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` is 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. We are still breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. The stdin still contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers. The value of `x` is still greater than 0. `subseq_lens` is still a list and `mx` is still an integer.

Output State: **`x` is greater than 0, `subseq_lens` is a list, `mx` is an integer, `i` is 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers**
