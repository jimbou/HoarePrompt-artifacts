The variables in the loop head are `x` and `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x` and `i`. If `2 ** i` is less than or equal to `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is greater than or equal to `2 ** 2` and `i` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `x` must be greater than or equal to `2 ** 3` and `i` must be 2. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`x` is greater than or equal to 2 to the power of 3, `subseq_lens` is a list, `mx` is an integer, `i` is 2, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers**
