Output State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 1000, but not equal to 2, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `x`, `subseq_lens`, `mx`, and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains a space-separated list of integers as input. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement that we were directly inside.
