The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is 0, so the new value of `i` is 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. We are still breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. stdin still contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers.
Output State: **`x` is not equal to 0, `subseq_lens` is a list, `mx` is an integer, `i` is 1, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
