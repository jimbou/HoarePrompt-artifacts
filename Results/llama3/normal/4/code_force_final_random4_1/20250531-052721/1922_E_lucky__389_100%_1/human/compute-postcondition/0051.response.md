Output State: **x is 0, subseq_lens is a list of integers, mx is an integer, i is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(x) + 1, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable x has been reduced to 0, the list subseq_lens contains a sequence of integers representing the lengths of subsequences, mx is the maximum length of these subsequences, and i is the smallest integer greater than or equal to the base-2 logarithm of the original value of x plus 1. The stdin still contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers.
