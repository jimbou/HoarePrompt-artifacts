Output: **`x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list of integers, `mx` is an integer, `i` is equal to the length of `subseq_lens`, `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx-1` and also includes all elements of `subseq_lens` except the first one at the end, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers, and the length of `ansv` which is equal to `mx` plus the length of `subseq_lens` minus 1 is being printed**
