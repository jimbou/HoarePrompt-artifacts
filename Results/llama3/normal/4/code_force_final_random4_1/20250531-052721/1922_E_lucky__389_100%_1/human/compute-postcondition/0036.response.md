According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable x. If x is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, x is greater than or equal to 2 to the power of i, so for the loop to be executed one more time x must be greater than 0.
State: **`x` is greater than 0, `subseq_lens` is a list, `mx` is an integer, `i` is the smallest integer such that 2 to the power of `i` is greater than `x`, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers. If `i` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `subseq_lens` is a list with (i - 1) appended to it, `mx` is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and (i - 1), and stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers.**
