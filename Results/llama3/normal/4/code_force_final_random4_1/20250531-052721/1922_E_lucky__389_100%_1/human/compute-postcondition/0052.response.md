Output State: **`x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list of integers, `mx` is an integer, `i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(0) + 1, `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx-1`, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `x` remains 0, the list of integers `subseq_lens` remains unchanged, the integer `mx` remains the same, the value of `i` is still the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(0) + 1, a new list `ansv` is created containing integers from 0 to `mx-1`, and the stdin still contains a space-separated list of integers.
