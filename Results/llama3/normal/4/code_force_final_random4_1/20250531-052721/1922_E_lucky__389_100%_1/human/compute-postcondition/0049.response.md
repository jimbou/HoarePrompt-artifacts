Output State: **x is greater than or equal to 2 to the power of (i - 1), subseq_lens is a list containing (i - 1), mx is the maximum of its original value and (i - 1), i is the smallest integer such that 2 to the power of i is greater than the original value of x minus 2 to the power of (i - 1), stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers.**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been reduced by 2 to the power of `(i - 1)`, and `subseq_lens` now contains the value `(i - 1)`. The value of `mx` has been updated to be the maximum of its original value and `(i - 1)`. The value of `i` remains the smallest integer such that 2 to the power of `i` is greater than the original value of `x` minus 2 to the power of `(i - 1)`. Stdin still contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers.
