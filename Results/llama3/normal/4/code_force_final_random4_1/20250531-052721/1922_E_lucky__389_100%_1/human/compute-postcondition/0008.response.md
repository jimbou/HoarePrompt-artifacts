The only variable in the loop head is variable x, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable x.  If x is not equal to 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, x is an integer between 1 and 1000, but not equal to 2. This ensures that x is not equal to 0, so no adjustment is needed.
State: **x is an integer between 1 and 1000, but not equal to 2, subseq_lens is an empty list, mx is 0, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers.**
