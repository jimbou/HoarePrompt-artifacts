The code prints the element at index `i` of the list `ansv`. Since `i` is 1, it prints the second element of the list `ansv`. The list `ansv` contains integers from 0 to `mx-1` and also includes all elements of `subseq_lens` except the first one at the end. Since the first element of the list `ansv` is 0, the second element of the list `ansv` is 1.
Output: **1**
