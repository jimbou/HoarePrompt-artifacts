The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` was 1, so the new value of `i` is 2. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is greater than or equal to 2, `subseq_lens` is a list, `mx` is an integer, `i` is 2, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers.
Output State: **`x` is greater than or equal to 2, `subseq_lens` is a list, `mx` is an integer, `i` is 2, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers**
