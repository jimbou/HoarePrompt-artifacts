Output State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 1000, but not equal to 2, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, `i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(x) + 1, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `x` remains an integer between 1 and 1000 (excluding 2), `subseq_lens` remains an empty list, `mx` remains 0, and `i` becomes the smallest integer greater than or equal to the base-2 logarithm of `x` plus 1. The input in stdin remains unchanged, containing a space-separated list of integers.
