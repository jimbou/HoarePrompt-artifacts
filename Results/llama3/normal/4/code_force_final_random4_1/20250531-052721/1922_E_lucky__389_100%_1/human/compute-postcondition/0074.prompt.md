You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (1 <= t <= 1000) and then t space-separated integers (2 <= X <= 10^18).
    x = int(input())
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    if (x == 2) :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
        return
        #The program returns nothing, as the return statement is empty. The values of the variables remain unchanged: x is still an integer equal to 2, subseq_lens is still an empty list, and mx is still 0. The input from stdin has been read, but its value is not used in the program. The output of the program is still 1, and the printed value is still 0.
    #State: x is an integer between 1 and 1000, but not equal to 2, subseq_lens is an empty list, mx is 0, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers.
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        
        while 2 ** i <= x:
            i += 1
        
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i - 1)
            x -= 2 ** (i - 1)
            mx = max(mx, i - 1)
        
    #State: x is 0, subseq_lens is a list of integers, mx is an integer, i is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(x) + 1, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers.
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
        
    #State: `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list of integers, `mx` is an integer, `i` is equal to the length of `subseq_lens`, `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx-1` and also includes all elements of `subseq_lens` except the first one at the end, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers.
    print(len(ansv))
    #This is printed: mx + len(subseq_lens) - 1
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
        
    #State: `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list of integers, `mx` is an integer, `i` is equal to the length of `ansv`, `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx-1` and also includes all elements of `subseq_lens` except the first one at the end, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers, and all elements of the list `ansv` are printed.
    print()
    #This is printed: nothing (an empty line)

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns nothing, as the return statement is empty. The values of the variables remain unchanged: x is still an integer equal to 2, subseq_lens is still an empty list, and mx is still 0. The input from stdin has been read, but its value is not used in the program. The output of the program is still 1, and the printed value is still 0.

Case_2: `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list of integers, `mx` is an integer, `i` is equal to the length of `ansv`, `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx-1` and also includes all elements of `subseq_lens` except the first one at the end, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers, and all elements of the list `ansv` are printed.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
