Output State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 1000, but not equal to 2, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, `i` is 1, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains a space-separated list of integers as input.
