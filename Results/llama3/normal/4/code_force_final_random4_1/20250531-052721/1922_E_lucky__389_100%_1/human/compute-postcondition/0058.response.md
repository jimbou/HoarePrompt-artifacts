Output State: **`x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `mx` is an integer, `i` is 3, `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx-1` and also includes the second and third elements of `subseq_lens` at the end and the fourth element of `subseq_lens` at the end, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers.**

In natural language, the output state is that the value of `x` remains 0, the list `subseq_lens` remains unchanged with at least 4 elements, the value of `mx` remains the same, the value of `i` remains 3, and the list `ansv` now includes the fourth element of `subseq_lens` at the end, in addition to the integers from 0 to `mx-1` and the second and third elements of `subseq_lens`. The stdin still contains a space-separated list of integers.
