The code prints the element at index `i` of the list `ansv`. Since `i` is 2, the third element of the list `ansv` is printed. The list `ansv` contains integers from 0 to `mx-1` and also includes all elements of `subseq_lens` except the first one at the end. Since `ansv` must have at least 3 elements, the third element is the number 2.
Output: **2**
