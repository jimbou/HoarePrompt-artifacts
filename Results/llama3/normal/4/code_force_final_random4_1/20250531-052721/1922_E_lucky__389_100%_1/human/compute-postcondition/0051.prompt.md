Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: x is an integer between 1 and 1000, but not equal to 2, subseq_lens is an empty list, mx is 0, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers.
Code of the loop:
while x != 0:
    i = 0
    while 2 ** i <= x:
        i += 1
    if i == 0:
        break
    else:
        subseq_lens.append(i - 1)
        x -= 2 ** (i - 1)
        mx = max(mx, i - 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`x` is an integer between 1 and 1000, but not equal to 2, `subseq_lens` is a list, `mx` is an integer, `i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(x) + 1, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers. If `i` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `subseq_lens` contains a single integer `i - 1`, `mx` is the maximum of 0 and `i - 1`, and `i` is larger than 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`x` is greater than or equal to 2 to the power of `i`, `subseq_lens` is a list, `mx` is an integer, `i` is the smallest integer such that 2 to the power of `i` is greater than `x`, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers. If `i` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `subseq_lens` is a list with (i - 1) appended to it, `mx` is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and (i - 1), and stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`x` is greater than or equal to 2 to the power of `i`, `subseq_lens` is a list, `mx` is an integer, `i` is the smallest integer such that 2 to the power of `i` is greater than `x`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers. If `i` is 0, the current value of `i` is 0. Otherwise, `x` is greater than or equal to 2 to the power of (i - 1), `subseq_lens` is a list containing (i - 1), `mx` is the maximum of its original value and (i - 1), `i` is the smallest integer such that 2 to the power of `i` is greater than the original value of `x` minus 2 to the power of (i - 1).


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
