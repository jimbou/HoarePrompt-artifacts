Based on the precondition, the variable `k` is an integer between 2 and 100. The `print` statement simply prints the value of `k - 1`.

Since `k` is at least 2, `k - 1` will be at least 1. Therefore, the output will be an integer between 1 and 99.

Output: **an integer between 1 and 99 (which is k - 1)**
