Output State: **t is an integer that must be at least 3, i is 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 100, k is an integer between 2 and 100, l is a list of n integers between 1 and 100, p is a list of counts of each unique integer in l.**

The code reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to n and k. It then reads a list of n integers from stdin and assigns it to l. Finally, it creates a list p containing the count of each unique integer in l. 

The value of t and i remains unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The value of stdin is reduced by two lines as two lines of input are read. The value of n and k is updated to the values read from stdin. The value of l is updated to the list of integers read from stdin. The value of p is calculated based on the unique integers in l.
