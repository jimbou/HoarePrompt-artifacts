The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `t` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `t` must be at least 3.
State: **t is an integer that must be at least 3, i is 2, stdin contains t-3 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 100, k is an integer between 2 and 100, l is a list of n integers between 1 and 100, p is a list of counts of each unique integer in l. If the maximum count of any integer in l is greater than or equal to k, then k - 1 is printed. Otherwise, the value of n is printed.**
