Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains n integers. The function then determines the maximum count of any unique integer in the list of n integers. If this maximum count is greater than or equal to k, it prints k-1; otherwise, it prints the value of n. The function repeats this process for each test case, and once all test cases have been processed, it leaves the standard input empty.**
