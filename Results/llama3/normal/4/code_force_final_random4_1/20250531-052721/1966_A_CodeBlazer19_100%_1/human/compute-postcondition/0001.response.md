The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, which ensures that the loop will execute. However, to make it more precise, we can adjust the state of `t` to be at least 1 and `i` is 0.
State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 1, `i` is 0, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n <= 100, 2 <= k <= 100). The second line contains `n` integers `c_1`, `c_2`, ..., `c_n` (1 <= c_i <= 100).**
