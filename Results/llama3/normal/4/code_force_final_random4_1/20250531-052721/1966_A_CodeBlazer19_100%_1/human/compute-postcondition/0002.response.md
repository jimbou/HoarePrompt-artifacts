Output State: **t is an integer that must be at least 1, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 100, k is an integer between 2 and 100, l is a list of n integers between 1 and 100, p is a list of counts of each unique integer in l.**

The code executes the following operations:

1. The first line reads two integers `n` and `k` from stdin, which are assigned to the variables `n` and `k`, respectively. This reduces the number of test cases in stdin by 1.

2. The second line reads `n` integers from stdin, which are assigned to the list `l`. This consumes the second line of the test case from stdin.

3. The third line creates a list `p` containing the count of each unique integer in `l`. This is done by using a list comprehension that iterates over the unique integers in `l` (obtained using `set(l)`) and counts the occurrences of each integer in `l` using `l.count(j)`.

The final state includes the initial values of `t` and `i`, which remain unchanged. The value of `n` and `k` are updated to the values read from stdin, and `l` and `p` are new variables created by the code. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 1.
