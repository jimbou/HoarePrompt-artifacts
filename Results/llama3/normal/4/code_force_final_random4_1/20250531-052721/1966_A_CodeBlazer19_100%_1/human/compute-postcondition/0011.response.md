Output State: **t is an integer that must be at least 2, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 100, k is an integer between 2 and 100, l is a list of n integers between 1 and 100, p is a list of counts of each unique integer in l.**

The code first reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to `n` and `k`, respectively. This reduces the number of test cases in stdin by 1. Then, it reads a list of `n` integers from stdin and assigns it to `l`, further reducing the number of test cases in stdin by 1. Finally, it creates a list `p` containing the counts of each unique integer in `l`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.
