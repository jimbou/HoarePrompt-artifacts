Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is 0, `i` is 3, `m` is an integer between -2 * (the original value of k) and 3 * 10^5 - 2 * (the original value of k), is not equal to 0, is not equal to 1, and is at least 3, `dp` is a list of `m+1` elements where `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 9 and all other elements are 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus (the original value of `k` plus one) test cases, `c` equals `r`, `num` is equal to the original value of `k`**

In this output state, the value of `dp[i]` has been updated to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`, which is equivalent to `(dp[2] + (3 - 1) * dp[1] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`, which is equal to `(3 + 2 * 1 * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`, which is equal to `9`. The values of the other variables remain the same.
