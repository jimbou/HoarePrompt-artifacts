Output State: **t is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, k is 0, i is equal to the original value of k, num is an integer between 0 and 2 * (the original value of k), c and r are integers, and stdin contains no test cases. If m is 0, the number 1 is being printed. If m is 1, the number 1 is being printed. If m is greater than 1, dp is a list of m+1 elements with dp[1] equal to 1, dp[2] equal to 3, and dp[i] equal to (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7) for all i from 3 to m inclusive, and the value of dp[m] is being printed which is equal to (dp[m - 1] + (m - 1) * dp[m - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7).**

This output state means that after the loop executes all the iterations, the variable t will be 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The variables n, k, i, num, c, and r will have the same values as they had after the last iteration of the loop. The variable stdin will contain no test cases, indicating that all test cases have been processed. If m is 0 or 1, the number 1 will be printed. If m is greater than 1, the value of dp[m] will be printed, which is calculated using the recurrence relation dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7) for all i from 3 to m inclusive.
