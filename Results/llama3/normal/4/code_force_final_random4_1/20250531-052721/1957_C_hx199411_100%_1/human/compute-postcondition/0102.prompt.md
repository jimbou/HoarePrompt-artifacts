Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 0 and is 2 less than its original value and the original value of t must be greater or equal to 2, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, k is an integer, i is equal to the original value of k, num is 0, c and r are integers, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus (the original value of k plus twice the original value of k plus 1) test cases. If m is 0, the number 1 is being printed. If m is 1, the number 1 is being printed. If m is greater than 1, dp is a list of m+1 elements with dp[1] equal to 1, dp[2] equal to 3, and dp[i] equal to (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7) for all i from 3 to m inclusive, and the value of dp[m] is being printed which is equal to (dp[m - 1] + (m - 1) * dp[m - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    if c == r:
        num += 1
    else:
        num += 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0 and is 2 less than its original value and the original value of `t` must be greater or equal to 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `num` is either 1 or 2, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus (the original value of `k` plus twice the original value of `k` plus 2) test cases. If `m` is 0, the number 1 is being printed. If `m` is 1, the number 1 is being printed. If `m` is greater than 1, `dp` is a list of `m+1` elements with `dp[1]` equal to 1, `dp[2]` equal to 3, and `dp[i]` equal to (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7) for all `i` from 3 to `m` inclusive, and the value of `dp[m]` is being printed which is equal to (dp[m - 1] + (m - 1) * dp[m - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7). Additionally, if `c` is equal to `r`, then `num` is 1, otherwise `num` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0 and is 2 less than its original value and the original value of `t` must be greater or equal to 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `num` is either 1, 2, 3 or 4, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `m` is either 0 or 1, `dp` is a list of `m+1` elements with `dp[1]` equal to 1, `dp[2]` equal to 3, and `dp[i]` equal to (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7) for all `i` from 3 to `m` inclusive, and the value of `dp[m]` is being printed which is equal to (dp[m - 1] + (m - 1) * dp[m - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7). Additionally, if `c` is equal to `r`, then `num` is either 1 or 2, otherwise `num` is either 3 or 4, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus (the original value of `k` plus twice the original value of `k` plus 2) minus 1 test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0 and is 2 less than its original value and the original value of `t` must be greater or equal to 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `num` is either 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `m` is either 0 or 1, `dp` is a list of `m+1` elements with `dp[1]` equal to 1, `dp[2]` equal to 3, and `dp[i]` equal to (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7) for all `i` from 3 to `m` inclusive, and the value of `dp[m]` is being printed which is equal to (dp[m - 1] + (m - 1) * dp[m - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7). Additionally, if `c` is equal to `r`, then `num` is either 2 or 3 or 4, otherwise `num` is either 5 or 6, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus (the original value of `k` plus twice the original value of `k` plus 2) minus 2 test cases.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
