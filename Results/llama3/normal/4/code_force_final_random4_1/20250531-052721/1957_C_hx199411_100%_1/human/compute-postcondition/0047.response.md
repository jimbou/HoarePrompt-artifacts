Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `m` is an integer between -2 * (the original value of k) and 3 * 10^5 - 2 * (the original value of k), `num` is 1, `c` equals `r` and both are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus (the original value of k plus four) test cases**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The number of test cases in stdin has also been reduced by one.
