Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `i` is 1, `c` and `r` are integers, if `c` equals `r`, then `num` is 1. Otherwise, `num` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged. The variables `c` and `r` are assigned the values of two integers from the input, which are split by a space. The value of `num` is determined based on the comparison of `c` and `r`. If they are equal, `num` is 1; otherwise, it is 2. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, as two test cases have been consumed by the input operation.
