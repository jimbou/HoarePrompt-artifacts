Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the number of ways to place dominoes on an n x n grid such that no two dominoes overlap, given that k dominoes are already placed at positions (r_i, c_i). The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the result, which is the most efficient approach for this problem. It also correctly handles the cases where there are no available positions for dominoes (m = 0) or only one available position (m = 1). The program also correctly prints the result modulo 10^9 + 7 to avoid overflow.

Correctness: **True**
