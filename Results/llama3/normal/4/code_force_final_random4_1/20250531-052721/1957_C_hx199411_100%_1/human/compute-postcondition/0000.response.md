The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the stdin and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case starts with two integers `n` and `k`, the first integer is assigned to `t`. The value of `t` is equal to the number of test cases. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= `n` <= 3 * 10^5, 0 <= `k` <= `n`) on the first line, and `k` lines of two integers `r_i` and `c_i` (1 <= `r_i`, `c_i` <= `n`) on the following lines.**
