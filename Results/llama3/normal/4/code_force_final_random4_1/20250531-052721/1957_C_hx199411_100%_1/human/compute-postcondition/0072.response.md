The only objects in the loop head are variables  i and m, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable m. If m is at least 3, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, t is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, k is 0, i is equal to the original value of k, m is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive minus the original value of k if c equals r for all iterations, or m is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive minus twice the original value of k if c is not equal to r for all iterations, num is an integer between 0 and 2 * (the original value of k), c and r are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus (the original value of k plus twice the original value of k) test cases, m is not equal to 0 and m is not equal to 1, dp is a list of m+1 elements with dp[1] equal to 1 and dp[2] equal to 3 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to m is at least 3 and i is now 3. 
State: **t is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, k is 0, i is 3, m is at least 3, num is an integer between 0 and 2 * (the original value of k), c and r are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus (the original value of k plus twice the original value of k) test cases, dp is a list of m+1 elements with dp[1] equal to 1 and dp[2] equal to 3**
