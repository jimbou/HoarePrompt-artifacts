Output State: **t is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, k is 0, i is equal to m, m is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive minus the original value of k if c equals r for all iterations, or m is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive minus twice the original value of k if c is not equal to r for all iterations, num is an integer between 0 and 2 * (the original value of k), c and r are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus (the original value of k plus twice the original value of k) test cases, dp is a list of m+1 elements with dp[1] equal to 1, dp[2] equal to 3, and dp[i] equal to (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7) for all i from 3 to m inclusive.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the values of the variables in the loop head and body. The variable `i` is now equal to `m`, and the list `dp` has been updated according to the loop body. The other variables remain unchanged.
