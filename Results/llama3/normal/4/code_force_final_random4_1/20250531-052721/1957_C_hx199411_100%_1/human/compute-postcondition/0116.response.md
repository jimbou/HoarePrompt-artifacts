The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and m, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `m` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 4, and for the loop to execute again `m` must be at least 4.
State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 2 less than its original value and the original value of `t` must be greater or equal to 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 4, `num` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ..., 2 * (the original value of `k`), `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `dp` is a list of `m+1` elements with `dp[1]` equal to 1, `dp[2]` equal to 3, and `dp[i]` equal to (`dp[i - 1]` + (`i - 1`) * `dp[i - 2]` * 2) % (10^9 + 7) for all `i` from 3 to `m` inclusive, and the value of `dp[m]` is being printed which is equal to (`dp[m - 1]` + (`m - 1`) * `dp[m - 2]` * 2) % (10^9 + 7), `m` is either `n - num` or `n - (2 * (the original value of `k`)) or `n - (the original value of `k`), `m` is at least 4, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus (the original value of `k` plus twice the original value of `k` plus 2) minus (the original value of `k` - 1) test cases, and the value of `dp[i]` has been updated to (`dp[i - 1]` + (`i - 1`) * `dp[i - 2]` * 2) % (10^9 + 7).**
