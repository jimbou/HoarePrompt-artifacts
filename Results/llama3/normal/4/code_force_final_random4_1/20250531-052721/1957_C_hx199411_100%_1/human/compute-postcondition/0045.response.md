Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `m` is an integer between -2 * (the original value of k) and 3 * 10^5 - 2 * (the original value of k), `num` is 0, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus (the original value of k plus three) test cases**

The code reads two integers from the input, separated by a space, and assigns them to the variables `c` and `r`, respectively. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus (the original value of k plus three) test cases.
