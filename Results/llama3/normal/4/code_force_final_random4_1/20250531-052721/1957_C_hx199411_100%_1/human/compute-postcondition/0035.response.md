The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, `m` is at least 5. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 5 and for the loop to execute again `m` must be greater than 5.
State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is 0, `i` is 5, `m` is an integer between -2 * (the original value of `k`) and 3 * 10^5 - 2 * (the original value of `k`), is not equal to 0, is not equal to 1, is at least 4, and is greater than 5, `dp` is a list of `m+1` elements where `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 9, `dp[4]` is (dp[3] + (4 - 1) * dp[3] * 2) % (10^9 + 7), `dp[5]` is (dp[4] + (5 - 1) * dp[4] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)**
