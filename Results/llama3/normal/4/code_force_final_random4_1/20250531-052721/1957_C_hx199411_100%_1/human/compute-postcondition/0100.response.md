Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 2 less than its original value and the original value of `t` must be greater or equal to 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `num` is either 3, 4, 5 or 6, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `m` is either 0 or 1, `dp` is a list of `m+1` elements with `dp[1]` equal to 1, `dp[2]` equal to 3, and `dp[i]` equal to (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7) for all `i` from 3 to `m` inclusive, and the value of `dp[m]` is being printed which is equal to (dp[m - 1] + (m - 1) * dp[m - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7). Additionally, if `c` is equal to `r`, then `num` is either 3 or 4, otherwise `num` is either 5 or 6, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus (the original value of `k` plus twice the original value of `k` plus 2) minus 2 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been updated to be either 3, 4, 5, or 6, and the relationship between `num` and the equality of `c` and `r` has been updated accordingly. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
