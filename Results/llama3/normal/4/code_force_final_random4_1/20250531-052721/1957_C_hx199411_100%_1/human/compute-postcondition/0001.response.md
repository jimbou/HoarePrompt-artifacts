To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the loop condition, which is simply `while t:`. This means the loop will execute as long as `t` is not zero.

Given the state right before the loop:

- `t` is the number of test cases,
- stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= `n` <= 3 * 10^5, 0 <= `k` <= `n`) on the first line, and `k` lines of two integers `r_i` and `c_i` (1 <= `r_i`, `c_i` <= `n`) on the following lines.

The only variable in the loop head is `t`. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0. The state of `t` being "the number of test cases" implies it could be any non-negative integer, but for the loop to certainly execute one time, it needs to be adjusted to ensure it is at least 1.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= `n` <= 3 * 10^5, 0 <= `k` <= `n`) on the first line, and `k` lines of two integers `r_i` and `c_i` (1 <= `r_i`, `c_i` <= `n`) on the following lines.**
