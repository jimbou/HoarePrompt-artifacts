Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `num` is 2, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases. Additionally, `c` is not equal to `r`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `num` has been increased by 2, and all other variables remain unchanged. The conditions on `t`, `n`, `k`, `c`, `r`, and `i` are still valid, and the number of test cases in stdin has not changed.
