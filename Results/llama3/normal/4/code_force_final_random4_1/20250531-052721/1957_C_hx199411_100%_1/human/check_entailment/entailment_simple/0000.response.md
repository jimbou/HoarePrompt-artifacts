Reasoning: The given Python program is correct. It correctly calculates the number of different final configurations possible when continuing the game after k moves. The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of configurations, which is efficient for large inputs. The program also correctly handles the case where m is 0 or 1, and prints the correct result in these cases.

Correctness: **True**
