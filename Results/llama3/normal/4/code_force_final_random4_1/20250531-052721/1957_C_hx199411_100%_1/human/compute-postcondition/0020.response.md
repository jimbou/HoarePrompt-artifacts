Output State: **t is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, k is 0, i is equal to the original value of k, stdin contains multiple test cases minus (the original value of k plus one) test cases. If c equals r, then num is equal to the original value of k. Otherwise, num is equal to 2 times the original value of k.**

This output state means that after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the value of `t` remains the same as in the initial state, `n` also remains unchanged, `k` becomes 0, `i` becomes equal to the original value of `k`, and the number of test cases in `stdin` decreases by the original value of `k` plus one. The value of `num` depends on whether `c` equals `r`: if they are equal, `num` becomes equal to the original value of `k`, otherwise, `num` becomes twice the original value of `k`.
