Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `i` is 1, `c` and `r` are integers. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is 2. Otherwise, `num` is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.***
