To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `m`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3, and `m` is an integer between -2 * (the original value of `k`) and 3 * 10^5 - 2 * (the original value of `k`), is not equal to 0, is not equal to 1, and is at least 3.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 4. The value of `m` remains the same, but we need to ensure that `m` is greater than 4 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is 0, `i` is 4, `m` is an integer between -2 * (the original value of `k`) and 3 * 10^5 - 2 * (the original value of `k`), is not equal to 0, is not equal to 1, is at least 3, and is greater than 4, `dp` is a list of `m+1` elements where `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 9 and all other elements are 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus (the original value of `k` plus one) test cases, `c` equals `r`, `num` is equal to the original value of `k`**
