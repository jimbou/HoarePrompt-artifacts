Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `m` is an integer between -2 * (the original value of k) and 3 * 10^5 - 2 * (the original value of k), `num` is either 5 or 6, `c` and `r` are integers that are input from stdin, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus (the original value of k plus six) test cases. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is 5, otherwise if `c` is not equal to `r`, then `num` is 6.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains the same, `n` is still an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is still at least 4, `i` is still 3, `m` is still an integer between -2 * (the original value of k) and 3 * 10^5 - 2 * (the original value of k), but `num` has increased by 2. Now, `num` is either 5 or 6. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is 5, otherwise if `c` is not equal to `r`, then `num` is 6. The values of `c` and `r` are still integers that are input from stdin, and stdin still contains multiple test cases minus (the original value of k plus six) test cases.
