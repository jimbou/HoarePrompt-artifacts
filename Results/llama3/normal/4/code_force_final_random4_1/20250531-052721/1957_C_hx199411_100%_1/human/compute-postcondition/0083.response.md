The only variable in the loop head is variable `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value. So for the loop to be executed one more time the original value of `t` needed to have been equal or greater than 2 and `t` currently must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value and the original value of `t` must be greater or equal to 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is 0, `i` is equal to the original value of `k`, `num` is an integer between 0 and 2 * (the original value of `k`), `c` and `r` are integers, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus (the original value of `k` plus twice the original value of `k`) test cases. If `m` is 0, the number 1 is being printed. If `m` is 1, the number 1 is being printed. If `m` is greater than 1, `dp` is a list of `m+1` elements with `dp[1]` equal to 1, `dp[2]` equal to 3, and `dp[i]` equal to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)` for all `i` from 3 to `m` inclusive, and the value of `dp[m]` is being printed which is equal to `(dp[m - 1] + (m - 1) * dp[m - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)**
