Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `m` is an integer between -2 * (the original value of k) and 3 * 10^5 - 2 * (the original value of k), `num` is 2, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus (the original value of k plus three) test cases, and `c` is not equal to `r`**

The code increments the value of `num` by 2. The initial value of `num` was 0, so the new value of `num` is 2. The other variables are not affected by this code snippet. The conditions on the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
