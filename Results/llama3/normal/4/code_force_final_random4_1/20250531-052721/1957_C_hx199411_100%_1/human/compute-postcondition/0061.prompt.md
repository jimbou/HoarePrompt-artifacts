Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, k is an integer, i is equal to the original value of k, m is an integer between -2 * (the original value of k) and 3 * 10^5 - 2 * (the original value of k), num is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus (the original value of k plus two) test cases.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    if c == r:
        num += 1
    else:
        num += 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `m` is an integer between -2 * (the original value of k) and 3 * 10^5 - 2 * (the original value of k), `num` is either 1 or 2, `c` and `r` are integers, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus (the original value of k plus three or four) test cases. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is 1, otherwise `num` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `m` is an integer between -2 * (the original value of k) and 3 * 10^5 - 2 * (the original value of k), `num` is either 2, 3 or 4, `c` and `r` are integers, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus (the original value of k plus four) test cases. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is 2, otherwise if `c` is not equal to `r`, then `num` is either 3 or 4.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `m` is an integer between -2 * (the original value of k) and 3 * 10^5 - 2 * (the original value of k), `num` is either 3, 4, 5 or 6, `c` and `r` are integers that are input from stdin, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus (the original value of k plus six or seven) test cases. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is either 3 or 5. If `c` is not equal to `r`, then `num` is either 4, 5 or 6.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
