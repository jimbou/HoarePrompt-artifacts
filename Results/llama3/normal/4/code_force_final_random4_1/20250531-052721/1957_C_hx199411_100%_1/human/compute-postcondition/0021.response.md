Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is 0, `i` is equal to the original value of `k`, `m` is an integer between -2 * (the original value of `k`) and 3 * 10^5 - 2 * (the original value of `k`), stdin contains multiple test cases minus (the original value of `k` plus one) test cases. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is equal to the original value of `k`. Otherwise, `num` is equal to 2 times the original value of `k`.**

In this output state, the value of `m` is calculated by subtracting `num` from `n`. Since `num` can be either the original value of `k` or 2 times the original value of `k`, the range of `m` is between `-2 * (the original value of `k`)` and `3 * 10^5 - 2 * (the original value of `k`)`. The other variables remain unchanged.
