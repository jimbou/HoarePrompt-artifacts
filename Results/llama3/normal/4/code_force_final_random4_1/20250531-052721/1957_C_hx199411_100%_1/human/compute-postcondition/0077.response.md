Output State: **t is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, k is 0, i is 5, m is at least 5, num is an integer between 0 and 2 * (the original value of k), c and r are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus (the original value of k plus twice the original value of k) test cases, dp is a list of m+1 elements with dp[1] equal to 1, dp[2] equal to 3, dp[3] equal to (dp[2] + 2 * dp[1] * 2) % (10^9 + 7), dp[4] equal to (dp[3] + 3 * dp[2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7), and dp[5] equal to (dp[4] + 4 * dp[3] * 2) % (10^9 + 7).**

The value of dp[i] is updated to (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7) where i is 5. This means dp[5] is calculated using the previously calculated values of dp[4] and dp[3]. The values of the other variables are not affected.
