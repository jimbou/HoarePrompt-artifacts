The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and m, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `m` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 4, and for the loop to execute again `m` must be greater than 4.
State: **t is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, k is 0, i is 4, m is at least 4, num is an integer between 0 and 2 * (the original value of k), c and r are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus (the original value of k plus twice the original value of k) test cases, dp is a list of m+1 elements with dp[1] equal to 1, dp[2] equal to 3, and dp[3] equal to (dp[2] + 2 * dp[1] * 2) % (10**9 + 7)**
