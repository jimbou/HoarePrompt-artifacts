Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is 0, `i` is 5, `m` is an integer between -2 * (the original value of `k`) and 3 * 10^5 - 2 * (the original value of `k`), is not equal to 0, is not equal to 1, is at least 4, and is greater than 5, `dp` is a list of `m+1` elements where `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 9, `dp[4]` is (dp[3] + (4 - 1) * dp[3] * 2) % (10^9 + 7), `dp[5]` is (dp[4] + (5 - 1) * dp[4] * 2) % (10^9 + 7), `dp[6]` is (dp[5] + (6 - 1) * dp[5] * 2) % (10^9 + 7).**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state except that `dp[6]` has been calculated and added to the list `dp`. The value of `dp[6]` is calculated using the formula `(dp[5] + (6 - 1) * dp[5] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, where `dp[5]` is the previously calculated value.
