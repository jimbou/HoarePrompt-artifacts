Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `i` is 1, `c` and `r` are integers, if `c` equals `r`, then `num` is 2. Otherwise, `num` is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been incremented by 1. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is now 2, otherwise, it is 3. The values of the other variables remain the same. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.
