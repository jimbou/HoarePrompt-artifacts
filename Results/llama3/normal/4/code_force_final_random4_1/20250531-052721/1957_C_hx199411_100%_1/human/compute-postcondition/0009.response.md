Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is 1. Otherwise, `num` is 2.***
