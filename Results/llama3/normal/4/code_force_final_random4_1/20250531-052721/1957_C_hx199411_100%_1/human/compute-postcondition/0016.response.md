Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to `n`, `i` is 2, `c` and `r` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is 2. Otherwise, `num` is 3.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `c` and `r` are updated to the integers input from the user, separated by a space. The value of `num` is determined based on whether `c` equals `r`. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by one.
