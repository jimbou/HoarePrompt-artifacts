Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `m` is an integer between -2 * (the original value of k) and 3 * 10^5 - 2 * (the original value of k), `num` is either 3, 4, 5 or 6, `c` and `r` are integers that are input from stdin, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus (the original value of k plus six or seven) test cases. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is either 3 or 5. If `c` is not equal to `r`, then `num` is either 4, 5 or 6.***
