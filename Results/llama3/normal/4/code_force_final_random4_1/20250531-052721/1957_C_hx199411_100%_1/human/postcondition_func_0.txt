This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers n and k, followed by k lines of two integers r_i and c_i. It then calculates the number of ways to place dominoes on an n x n grid such that no two dominoes overlap, given that k dominoes are already placed at positions (r_i, c_i). The function prints the result for each test case. If there are no available positions for dominoes (m = 0), it prints 1. If there is only one available position (m = 1), it also prints 1. Otherwise, it calculates the result using dynamic programming and prints the result modulo 10^9 + 7.
