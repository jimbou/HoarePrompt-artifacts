Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to `n`, `i` is 2, `c` and `r` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is 4. Otherwise, `num` is 5.**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been updated to be 2 more than its original value. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is now 4, otherwise, it is 5. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus four test cases.
