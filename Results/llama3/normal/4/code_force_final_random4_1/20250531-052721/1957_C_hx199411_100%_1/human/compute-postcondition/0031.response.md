To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `m`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `m` is at least 3.

State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is 0, `i` is 3, `m` is an integer between -2 * (the original value of k) and 3 * 10^5 - 2 * (the original value of k), is not equal to 0, is not equal to 1, and is at least 3, `dp` is a list of `m+1` elements where `dp[1]` is 1 and `dp[2]` is 3 and all other elements are 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus (the original value of `k` plus one) test cases, `c` equals `r`, `num` is equal to the original value of `k`**
