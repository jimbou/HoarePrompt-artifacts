Output State: **t is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, k is 0, i is 4, m is at least 4, num is an integer between 0 and 2 * (the original value of k), c and r are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus (the original value of k plus twice the original value of k) test cases, dp is a list of m+1 elements with dp[1] equal to 1, dp[2] equal to 3, dp[3] equal to (dp[2] + 2 * dp[1] * 2) % (10^9 + 7), and dp[4] equal to (dp[3] + 3 * dp[2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7).**

In this output state, the value of dp[4] has been updated according to the given formula, using the previously calculated values of dp[3] and dp[2]. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus (the original value of k plus twice the original value of k) test cases.
