Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `m` is an integer between -2 * (the original value of k) and 3 * 10^5 - 2 * (the original value of k), `num` is either 3, 4 or 5, `c` and `r` are integers that are input from stdin, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus (the original value of k plus seven) test cases. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is 3, otherwise if `c` is not equal to `r`, then `num` is either 4 or 5.**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been incremented by 1. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` was originally 2, so it is now 3. If `c` does not equal `r`, then `num` was originally either 3 or 4, so it is now either 4 or 5. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
