Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is 0, `i` is equal to the original value of `k`, `m` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive minus the original value of `k` if `c` equals `r` for all iterations, or `m` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive minus twice the original value of `k` if `c` is not equal to `r` for all iterations, `num` is an integer between 0 and 2 * (the original value of `k`), `c` and `r` are integers, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus (the original value of `k` plus twice the original value of `k`) test cases. Additionally, `m` is not equal to 0.***
