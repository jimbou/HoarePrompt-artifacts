Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `m` is an integer between -2 * (the original value of k) and 3 * 10^5 - 2 * (the original value of k), `num` is either 1 or 2, `c` and `r` are integers, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus (the original value of k plus three or four) test cases. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is 1, otherwise `num` is 2.***
