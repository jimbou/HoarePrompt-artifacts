Output: **t is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, k is 0, i is equal to m, m is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive minus the original value of k if c equals r for all iterations, or m is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive minus twice the original value of k if c is not equal to r for all iterations, num is an integer between 0 and 2 * (the original value of k), c and r are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus (the original value of k plus twice the original value of k) test cases, dp is a list of m+1 elements with dp[1] equal to 1, dp[2] equal to 3, and dp[i] equal to (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7) for all i from 3 to m inclusive, and the value of dp[m] is being printed which is equal to (dp[m - 1] + (m - 1) * dp[m - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)**
