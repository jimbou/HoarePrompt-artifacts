Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly calculates the number of different final configurations possible when continuing the game after k moves.

The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible configurations. It initializes a list dp of size m+1, where m is the number of remaining valid moves. It then fills up the dp list using the recurrence relation dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + (i-1) * dp[i-2] * 2) % (10**9 + 7), which represents the number of possible configurations for i remaining valid moves.

The program handles the base cases correctly, where m is 0 or 1, and prints 1 in these cases. For m greater than 1, it uses the dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of possible configurations.

The program also correctly handles the case where a move is mirrored by the computer, by incrementing the num variable by 2 for each non-diagonal move and by 1 for each diagonal move. This ensures that the number of remaining valid moves is correctly calculated.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
