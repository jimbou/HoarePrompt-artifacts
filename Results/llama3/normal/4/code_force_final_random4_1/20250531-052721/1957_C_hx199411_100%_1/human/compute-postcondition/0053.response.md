Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `m` is an integer between -2 * (the original value of k) and 3 * 10^5 - 2 * (the original value of k), `num` is either 2 or 3, `c` and `r` are integers, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus (the original value of k plus four) test cases. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is 2, otherwise `num` is 3.**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been incremented by 1. Since `num` was initially either 1 or 2, it is now either 2 or 3. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions related to `c` and `r` still apply. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus (the original value of k plus four) test cases.
