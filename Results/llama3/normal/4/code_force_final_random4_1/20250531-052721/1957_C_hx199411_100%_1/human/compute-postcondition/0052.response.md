Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `m` is an integer between -2 * (the original value of k) and 3 * 10^5 - 2 * (the original value of k), `num` is either 1 or 2, `c` and `r` are integers, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus (the original value of k plus four) test cases. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is 1, otherwise `num` is 2.**

The code accepts two integers from the input, separated by a space, and assigns them to `c` and `r`, respectively. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `m`, and `num` are not affected by this code. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus (the original value of k plus four) test cases. The relationship between `c`, `r`, and `num` is updated based on the new values of `c` and `r`.
