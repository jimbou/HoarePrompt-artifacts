Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `m` is an integer between -2 * (the original value of k) and 3 * 10^5 - 2 * (the original value of k), `num` is either 3 or 4, `c` and `r` are integers, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus (the original value of k plus four) test cases. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is 3, otherwise `num` is 4.**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been updated to either 3 or 4, which is 2 more than its original value. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions related to `c` and `r` still apply. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus (the original value of k plus four) test cases.
