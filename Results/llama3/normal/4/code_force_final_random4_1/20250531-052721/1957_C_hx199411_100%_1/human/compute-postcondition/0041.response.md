Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is 0, `i` is equal to the original value of `k`, `m` is an integer between -2 * (the original value of `k`) and 3 * 10^5 - 2 * (the original value of `k`). If `m` is 0, then if `c` equals `r`, `num` is equal to the original value of `k`. Otherwise, `num` is equal to 2 times the original value of `k`, and 1 is being printed. If `m` is not 0, then `i` is equal to `m` if `m` is not 1, otherwise `i` is equal to the original value of `k`. If `m` is 1, then if `c` equals `r`, `num` is equal to the original value of `k`. Otherwise, `num` is equal to 2 times the original value of `k`, and the number 1 is being printed. If `m` is not 1, then dp is a list of m+1 elements where dp[1] is 1, dp[2] is 3, and for all i from 3 to m, dp[i] is (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7), and dp[m] is printed. stdin contains multiple test cases minus (the original value of `k` plus one) test cases.**
