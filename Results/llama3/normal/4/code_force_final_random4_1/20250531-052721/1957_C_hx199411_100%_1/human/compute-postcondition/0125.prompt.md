Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= `n` <= 3 * 10^5, 0 <= `k` <= `n`) on the first line, and `k` lines of two integers `r_i` and `c_i` (1 <= `r_i`, `c_i` <= `n`) on the following lines.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    num = 0
    for i in range(k):
        c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if c == r:
            num += 1
        else:
            num += 2
    m = n - num
    if m == 0:
        print(1)
    elif m == 1:
        print(1)
    else:
        dp = [(0) for i in range(m + 1)]
        dp[1] = 1
        dp[2] = 3
        for i in range(3, m + 1):
            dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
        print(dp[m])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is 0, `i` is equal to the original value of `k`, `m` is an integer between -2 * (the original value of `k`) and 3 * 10^5 - 2 * (the original value of `k`). If `m` is 0, then if `c` equals `r`, `num` is equal to the original value of `k`. Otherwise, `num` is equal to 2 times the original value of `k`, and 1 is being printed. If `m` is not 0, then `i` is equal to `m` if `m` is not 1, otherwise `i` is equal to the original value of `k`. If `m` is 1, then if `c` equals `r`, `num` is equal to the original value of `k`. Otherwise, `num` is equal to 2 times the original value of `k`, and the number 1 is being printed. If `m` is not 1, then dp is a list of m+1 elements where dp[1] is 1, dp[2] is 3, and for all i from 3 to m, dp[i] is (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7), and dp[m] is printed. stdin contains multiple test cases minus (the original value of `k` plus one) test cases.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is 0, `i` is equal to the original value of `k`, `num` is an integer between 0 and 2 * (the original value of `k`), `c` and `r` are integers, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus (the original value of `k` plus twice the original value of `k`) test cases. If `m` is 0, the number 1 is being printed. If `m` is 1, the number 1 is being printed. If `m` is greater than 1, `dp` is a list of `m+1` elements with `dp[1]` equal to 1, `dp[2]` equal to 3, and `dp[i]` equal to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)` for all `i` from 3 to `m` inclusive, and the value of `dp[m]` is being printed which is equal to `(dp[m - 1] + (m - 1) * dp[m - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *t is greater than 0 and is 2 less than its original value and the original value of t must be greater or equal to 2, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, k is an integer greater than or equal to 0, i is either equal to the original value of k or equal to m + 1, num is either 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ..., 2 * (the original value of k), c is an integer, r is an integer, dp is a list of m+1 elements with dp[1] equal to 1, dp[2] equal to 3, and dp[i] equal to (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7) for all i from 3 to m inclusive, and the value of dp[m] is being printed which is equal to (dp[m - 1] + (m - 1) * dp[m - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7), m is either n - num or n - (2 * (the original value of k)) or n - (the original value of k), and stdin contains multiple test cases minus (the original value of k plus twice the original value of k plus 2) minus (the original value of k - 1) test cases. If m is 0 or 1, the number 1 is being printed. Otherwise, the value of dp[m] is being printed which is equal to (dp[m - 1] + (m - 1) * dp[m - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7).


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
