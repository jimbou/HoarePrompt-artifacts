Output State: **t is greater than 0 and is 2 less than its original value and the original value of t must be greater or equal to 2, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, k is an integer, i is equal to the original value of k, num is 0, c and r are integers, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus (the original value of k plus twice the original value of k plus 1) test cases. If m is 0, the number 1 is being printed. If m is 1, the number 1 is being printed. If m is greater than 1, dp is a list of m+1 elements with dp[1] equal to 1, dp[2] equal to 3, and dp[i] equal to (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7) for all i from 3 to m inclusive, and the value of dp[m] is being printed which is equal to (dp[m - 1] + (m - 1) * dp[m - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)**
