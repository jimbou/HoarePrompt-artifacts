Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 2 less than its original value and the original value of `t` must be greater or equal to 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to the original value of `k`, `num` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ..., 2 * (the original value of `k`), `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `m` is either 0 or 1, `dp` is a list of `m+1` elements with `dp[1]` equal to 1, `dp[2]` equal to 3, and `dp[i]` equal to (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7) for all `i` from 3 to `m` inclusive, and the value of `dp[m]` is being printed which is equal to (dp[m - 1] + (m - 1) * dp[m - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7). Additionally, if `c` is equal to `r`, then `num` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ..., (the original value of `k`), otherwise `num` is either 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ..., 2 * (the original value of `k`), and stdin contains multiple test cases minus (the original value of `k` plus twice the original value of `k` plus 2) minus (the original value of `k` - 1) test cases.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` remains the same as in the initial state, `n` remains an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is now equal to its original value, `i` is also equal to the original value of `k`, and `num` can take any value between 0 and 2 times the original value of `k` inclusive, depending on the values of `c` and `r` in each iteration. The values of `m` and `dp` remain the same as in the initial state, and the value of `dp[m]` is being printed. The number of test cases in stdin has decreased by the original value of `k` minus 1.
