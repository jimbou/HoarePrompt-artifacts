Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to `n`, `i` is 2, `c` and `r` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is 3. Otherwise, `num` is 4.***
