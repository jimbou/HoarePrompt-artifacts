The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and k, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `k` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and `k` must be greater than 3.
State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `m` is an integer between -2 * (the original value of k) and 3 * 10^5 - 2 * (the original value of k), `num` is either 2, 3 or 4, `c` and `r` are integers, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus (the original value of k plus five) test cases. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is 2, otherwise if `c` is not equal to `r`, then `num` is either 3 or 4.**
