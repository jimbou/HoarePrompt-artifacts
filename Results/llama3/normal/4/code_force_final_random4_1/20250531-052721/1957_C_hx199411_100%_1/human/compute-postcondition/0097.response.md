The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `k` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 2 less than its original value and the original value of `t` must be greater or equal to 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `num` is either 1, 2, 3 or 4, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `m` is either 0 or 1, `dp` is a list of `m+1` elements with `dp[1]` equal to 1, `dp[2]` equal to 3, and `dp[i]` equal to (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7) for all `i` from 3 to `m` inclusive, and the value of `dp[m]` is being printed which is equal to (dp[m - 1] + (m - 1) * dp[m - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7). Additionally, if `c` is equal to `r`, then `num` is either 1 or 2, otherwise `num` is either 3 or 4, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus (the original value of `k` plus twice the original value of `k` plus 2) minus 1 test cases.**
