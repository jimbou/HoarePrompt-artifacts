Output State: **t is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, k is an integer between 0 and n inclusive, num is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**

The first line decrements the value of `t` by 1, so `t` becomes 1 less than its original value. The second line reads two integers `n` and `k` from stdin and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`, respectively. The third line initializes the variable `num` to 0. The value of `t` is still greater than 0, and the values of `n` and `k` are within their specified ranges. The value of `num` is 0. Stdin now contains one less test case.
