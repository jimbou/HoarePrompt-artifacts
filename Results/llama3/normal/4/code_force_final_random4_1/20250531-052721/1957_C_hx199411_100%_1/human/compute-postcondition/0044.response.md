To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `k`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `k` is at least 1. Since `i` is equal to the original value of `k`, we can adjust `i` to be equal to 1, which is the minimum value for `k` to ensure the loop executes.

The other variables, `t`, `n`, `m`, `num`, and `stdin`, are not directly related to the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `m` is an integer between -2 * (the original value of k) and 3 * 10^5 - 2 * (the original value of k), `num` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus (the original value of k plus two) test cases**
