Output: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is 0, `i` is equal to the original value of `k`, `m` is equal to 1, `c` equals `r` then `num` is equal to the original value of `k`. Otherwise, `num` is equal to 2 times the original value of `k`. stdin contains multiple test cases minus (the original value of `k` plus one) test cases, and the number 1 is being printed**
