Output State: **t is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, k is 0, i is 3, m is at least 3, num is an integer between 0 and 2 * (the original value of k), c and r are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus (the original value of k plus twice the original value of k) test cases, dp is a list of m+1 elements with dp[1] equal to 1, dp[2] equal to 3, and dp[3] equal to (dp[2] + 2 * dp[1] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7) which is equal to (3 + 2 * 1 * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7) which is equal to (3 + 4) % (10 ** 9 + 7) which is equal to 7 % (10 ** 9 + 7) which is equal to 7.**

In natural language, the output state is: t is still greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, n is still an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, k is still 0, i is still 3, m is still at least 3, num is still an integer between 0 and 2 * (the original value of k), c and r are still integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus (the original value of k plus twice the original value of k) test cases, and dp is a list of m+1 elements with dp[1] equal to 1, dp[2] equal to 3, and dp[3] equal to 7.
