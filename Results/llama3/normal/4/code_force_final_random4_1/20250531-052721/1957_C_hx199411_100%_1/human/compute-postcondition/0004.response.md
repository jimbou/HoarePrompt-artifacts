Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `num` is 0, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `num` remain unchanged. The values of `c` and `r` are assigned the two integers from the input, where `input().split(' ')` accepts a space-separated list of integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The value of `i` is still 0. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, since one test case has been processed.
