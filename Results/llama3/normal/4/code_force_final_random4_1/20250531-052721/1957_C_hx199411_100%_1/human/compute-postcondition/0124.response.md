Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0 and is 2 less than its original value and the original value of t must be greater or equal to 2, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, k is an integer greater than or equal to 0, i is either equal to the original value of k or equal to m + 1, num is either 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ..., 2 * (the original value of k), c is an integer, r is an integer, dp is a list of m+1 elements with dp[1] equal to 1, dp[2] equal to 3, and dp[i] equal to (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7) for all i from 3 to m inclusive, and the value of dp[m] is being printed which is equal to (dp[m - 1] + (m - 1) * dp[m - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7), m is either n - num or n - (2 * (the original value of k)) or n - (the original value of k), and stdin contains multiple test cases minus (the original value of k plus twice the original value of k plus 2) minus (the original value of k - 1) test cases. If m is 0 or 1, the number 1 is being printed. Otherwise, the value of dp[m] is being printed which is equal to (dp[m - 1] + (m - 1) * dp[m - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7).***
