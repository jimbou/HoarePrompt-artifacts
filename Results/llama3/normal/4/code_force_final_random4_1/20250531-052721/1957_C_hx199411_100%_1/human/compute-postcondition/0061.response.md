Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is 0, `i` is equal to the original value of `k`, `m` is an integer between -2 * (the original value of `k`) and 3 * 10^5 - 2 * (the original value of `k`), `num` is an integer between 0 and 2 * (the original value of `k`), `c` and `r` are integers, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus (the original value of `k` plus twice the original value of `k`) test cases. If `c` equals `r` for all iterations, then `num` is equal to the original value of `k`. If `c` is not equal to `r` for all iterations, then `num` is equal to twice the original value of `k`.**

This output state indicates that the loop has finished executing all its iterations. The value of `k` has been decremented to 0, and the value of `i` has been reset to its original value. The value of `num` has been updated based on the number of iterations and the values of `c` and `r` input from stdin. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
