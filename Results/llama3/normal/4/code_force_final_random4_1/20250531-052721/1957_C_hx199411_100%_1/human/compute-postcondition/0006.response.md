Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `num` is 1, `c` equals `r` and both are integers, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.
