To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `k`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `k` is at least 1.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Since `k` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, and `i` is now 2, `k` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `m` is an integer between -2 * (the original value of k) and 3 * 10^5 - 2 * (the original value of k), `num` is either 1 or 2, `c` and `r` are integers, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus (the original value of k plus three or four) test cases. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is 1, otherwise `num` is 2.**
