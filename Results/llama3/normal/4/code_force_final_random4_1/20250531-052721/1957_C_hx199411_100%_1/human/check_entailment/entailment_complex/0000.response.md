Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the number of ways to place dominoes on an n x n grid such that no two dominoes overlap, given that k dominoes are already placed at positions (r_i, c_i).

The program first calculates the number of available positions for dominoes (m) by subtracting the number of already placed dominoes (num) from the total number of positions (n). If there are no available positions (m = 0), it prints 1. If there is only one available position (m = 1), it also prints 1.

Otherwise, it uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to place dominoes. The dynamic programming array dp is initialized with dp[1] = 1 and dp[2] = 3. Then, for each i from 3 to m, it calculates dp[i] as (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7). This is because there are two ways to place a domino at position i: either horizontally or vertically. If it is placed horizontally, there are dp[i - 1] ways to place the remaining dominoes. If it is placed vertically, there are (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] ways to place the remaining dominoes, because there are (i - 1) ways to choose the position for the vertical domino and dp[i - 2] ways to place the remaining dominoes.

Finally, the program prints the result modulo 10^9 + 7.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and calculates the correct result. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
