Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 2 less than its original value and the original value of `t` must be greater or equal to 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `num` is either 1 or 2, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `m` is either 0 or 1, `dp` is a list of `m+1` elements with `dp[1]` equal to 1, `dp[2]` equal to 3, and `dp[i]` equal to (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7) for all `i` from 3 to `m` inclusive, and the value of `dp[m]` is being printed which is equal to (dp[m - 1] + (m - 1) * dp[m - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7). Additionally, if `c` is equal to `r`, then `num` is 1, otherwise `num` is 2, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus (the original value of `k` plus twice the original value of `k` plus 2) minus 1 test cases.**

The code assigns the values of `c` and `r` from the input, which are integers. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `num`, and `dp` remain unchanged. The value of `m` is either 0 or 1, and the value of `dp[m]` is being printed. The condition for `num` being 1 or 2 is still valid, and the number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 1.
