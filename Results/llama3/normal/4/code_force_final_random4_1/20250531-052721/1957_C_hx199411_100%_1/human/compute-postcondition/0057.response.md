Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `m` is an integer between -2 * (the original value of k) and 3 * 10^5 - 2 * (the original value of k), `num` is either 2, 3 or 4, `c` and `r` are integers that are input from stdin, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus (the original value of k plus six) test cases. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is 2, otherwise if `c` is not equal to `r`, then `num` is either 3 or 4.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their original properties, but `c` and `r` are now assigned integer values from the input. The number of test cases in stdin has decreased by one. The relationship between `num`, `c`, and `r` remains the same, with `num` being 2 if `c` equals `r`, and either 3 or 4 otherwise.
