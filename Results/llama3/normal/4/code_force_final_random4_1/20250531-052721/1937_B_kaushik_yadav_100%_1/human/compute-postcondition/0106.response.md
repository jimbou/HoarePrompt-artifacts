Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string of length `n`, `i` is `n`, `work` is False, `counter` is 2, `j` is 0, and the current value of `a` at index `j + 1` is equal to the current value of `b` at index `j`.**

In this output state, the value of `counter` has been incremented by 1, resulting in a value of 2. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and relationships.
