Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a binary string of length `n` that must have at least 2 characters, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string consisting of characters from `a` and `b`, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is either True or False, `counter` is 1, `j` is 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases with no inputs remaining for the current test case, and the string `ans` consisting of characters from `a` and `b` is being printed. Additionally, the character at index `j + 1` in string `a` is not equal to the character at index `j` in string `b`. Furthermore, either `a[j + 1]` is not equal to '0' or `b[j]` is not equal to '1'.***
