Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string of length `n`, `i` is `n`, `work` is False, `j` is 1. If `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', then `counter` is 1. Otherwise, `counter` is 1 or 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
