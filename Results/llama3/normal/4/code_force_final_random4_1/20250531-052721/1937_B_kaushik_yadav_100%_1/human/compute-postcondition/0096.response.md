Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a binary string of length greater than 1, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string of length 3 or 4, `i` is either 0 or 1, `work` is True or False, `j` is not defined, `counter` is not defined, and stdin is empty. If `i` is equal to the second last index of `a`, then `ans` is a string of length 4. Otherwise, `ans` is a string of length 3 or 4.***
