Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a binary string of length n, b is a binary string of length n, ans is an empty string, i is 0, work is True, stdin contains multiple test cases with no inputs remaining for the current test case.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a):
    if work:
        ans += a[i]
        if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
            work = False
        elif i + 1 == len(a):
            ans += b[i]
            break
        else:
            i += 1
    else:
        ans += b[i]
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a binary string of length n, b is a binary string of length n. If work is True, ans is a string consisting of the first character of a and either the last character of b if i + 1 is equal to the length of a, or the first character of a if i + 1 is not equal to the length of a, i is either n - 1 if i + 1 is equal to the length of a, or 1 if i + 1 is not equal to the length of a, and work is either False if the current value of b at index i is less than the current value of a at index i + 1, or True otherwise. If work is False, ans is a string consisting of the first character of b, i is 1, and work is False. In both cases, stdin contains multiple test cases with no inputs remaining for the current test case.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a binary string of length greater than 1, b is a binary string of length n. If work is True, then if i + 1 is less than the length of a and the character at index i of b is less than the character at index i + 1 of a, then i is 2, work is False, and ans is a string consisting of the first character of b. Otherwise, i is either 2 or 3, work is either False if the current value of b at index 1 is less than the current value of a at index 2, or True otherwise, and ans is a string consisting of the first character of a and the character at index 1 of a if work is True, or the first character of b if work is False, and the character at index 2 of b if i is 2, otherwise ans is a string consisting of the first character of a and the character at index 1 of a if work is True, or the first character of b if work is False. If work is False, then ans is a string consisting of the first character of a and the character of b at index i, i is 2, and work is either False if the current value of b at index i is less than the current value of a at index i + 1, or True otherwise.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a binary string of length greater than 3 if `i` is 3, or a binary string of length 3 if `i` is less than 3, `b` is a binary string of length `n`. If `work` is True, then if `i` + 1 is less than the length of `a` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`, then `work` is False, `i` is 2, and `ans` is a string consisting of the first character of `a` and the character of `b` at index `i`, and the character at index `i` of `a`. Otherwise, if `i` is equal to the length of `a` minus 1, then `work` is either False if the current value of `b` at index `i` is less than the current value of `a` at index `i` + 1, or True otherwise, and `ans` is a string consisting of the first character of `a` and the character of `b` at index `i`, and the character at index `i` of `a`, and the character at index `i` of `b`. If `i` is not equal to the length of `a` minus 1, then if `work` is True, `i` is either 2 or 3 or 4, `work` is either False if the current value of `b` at index 1 is less than the current value of `a` at index 2, or True otherwise, and `ans` is a string consisting of the first character of `a` and the character at index 1 of `a` if `work` is True, or the first character of `b` if `work` is False, and the character at index 2 of `b` if `i` is 2 or 3, otherwise `ans` is a string consisting of the first character of `a` and the character at index 1 of `a` if `work` is True, or the first character of `b` if `work` is False, and the character at index `i` of `a`. If `work` is False, then `i` is either 2 or 3, `work` is either False if the current value of `b` at index `i` is less than the current value of `a` at index `i` + 1, or True otherwise, and `ans` is a string consisting of the first character of `a` and the character of `b` at index `i`, and the character at index `i` of `a`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
