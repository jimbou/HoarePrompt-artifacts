Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases with two inputs remaining for each test case: two binary strings of the same length. The length of the strings is equal to the integer that was previously read. The integer is greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5. The sum of the lengths of the strings over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. t is an integer equal to the number of test cases.**

The first line assigns the value of the first input (the number of test cases) to `t`. Since `t` is now an integer, it is no longer a part of the input state. The second line reads the first input (the number of test cases) from stdin, leaving the remaining inputs (the binary strings) in stdin. No other variables are affected.
