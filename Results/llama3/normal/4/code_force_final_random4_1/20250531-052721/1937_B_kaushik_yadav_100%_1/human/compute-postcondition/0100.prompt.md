Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a binary string of length n, b is a binary string of length n, ans is an empty string, i is 0, work is True, j is not defined, and counter is not defined, stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a):
    if work:
        ans += a[i]
        if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
            work = False
        elif i + 1 == len(a):
            ans += b[i]
            break
        else:
            i += 1
    else:
        ans += b[i]
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string of length 1 or 2, `i` is 0 or 1, `work` is True or False, `j` is not defined, `counter` is not defined, and stdin is empty. If `work` is True, then if `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and the character at index `i` in string `b` is less than the character at index `i + 1` in string `a`, then `work` is False. Otherwise, if `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a`, then `ans` is a string of length 2. Otherwise, `i` is 1 and `ans` is a string of length 1. If `work` is False, then `ans` is a string consisting of the first character of `b`, `i` is 1, and `work` is False.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a binary string of length greater than 1, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string of length 2 or 3, `i` is either 0 or 1, `work` is True or False, `j` is not defined, `counter` is not defined, and stdin is empty. If `work` is True, then if `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`, then `work` is False. If `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, then `ans` is a string of length 3. Otherwise, `ans` is a string of length 2 or 3. If `work` is False, then `i` is 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a binary string of length greater than 1, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string of length 3 or 4, `i` is either 0 or 1, `work` is True or False, `j` is not defined, `counter` is not defined, and stdin is empty. If `work` is True, then if `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, then `work` is False. Otherwise, if `i` is equal to the second last index of `a`, then `ans` is a string of length 4. Otherwise, `ans` is a string of length 3 or 4. If `work` is False, then `i` is 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
