Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string of length `n`, `i` is `n`, `work` is False, `j` is 1, `counter` is 2 or 3**

In this output state, the value of `counter` has been incremented by 1, so it can now be either 2 or 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
