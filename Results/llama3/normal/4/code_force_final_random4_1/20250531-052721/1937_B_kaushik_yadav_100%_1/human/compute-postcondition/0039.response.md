Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string consisting of characters from `a` and `b`, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is either True or False, `counter` is 1, and stdin contains multiple test cases with no inputs remaining for the current test case, and the string `ans` consisting of characters from `a` and `b` is being printed.**

In this output state, a new variable `counter` is introduced and assigned the value 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `stdin` contains multiple test cases with no inputs remaining for the current test case is still valid, and the string `ans` consisting of characters from `a` and `b` is still being printed.
