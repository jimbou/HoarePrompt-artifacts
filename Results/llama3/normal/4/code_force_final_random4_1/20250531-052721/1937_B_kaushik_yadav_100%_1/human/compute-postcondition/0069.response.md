Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string of length 1, `i` is 0, `work` is True, `j` is not defined, `counter` is not defined, and stdin is empty.**

The code `ans += a[i]` appends the character at index `i` of string `a` to the end of string `ans`. Since `i` is 0, the first character of `a` is appended to `ans`. The length of `ans` is now 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
