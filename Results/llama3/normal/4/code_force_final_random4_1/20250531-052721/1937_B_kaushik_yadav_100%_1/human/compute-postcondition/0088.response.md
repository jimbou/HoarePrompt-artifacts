Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a binary string of length greater than 1, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string of length 2 or 3, `i` is either 0 or 1, `work` is True or False, `j` is not defined, `counter` is not defined, and stdin is empty. If `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`, then `work` is False. If `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, then `ans` is a string of length 3. Otherwise, `ans` is a string of length 2 or 3.***
