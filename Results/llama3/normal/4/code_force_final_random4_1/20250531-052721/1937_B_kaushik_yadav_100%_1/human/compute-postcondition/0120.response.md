To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the state of the variable `j`, as it is the only variable in the loop head.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `len(a) - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string of length `n`, `i` is `n`, `work` is False, `j` is 2, `counter` is either 1, 2, or 3 depending on the values of `a[j + 1]` and `b[j]`.**
