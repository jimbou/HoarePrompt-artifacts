The only variable in the loop head is variable `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than `len(a) - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `len(a)` is `n` which is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 1 and `len(a)` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a binary string of length `n` that must have at least 2 characters, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string of length `n` that is being printed, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is 1**
