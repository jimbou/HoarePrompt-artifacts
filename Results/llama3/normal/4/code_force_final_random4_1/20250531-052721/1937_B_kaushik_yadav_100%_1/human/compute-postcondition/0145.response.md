Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string of length 1 or 2, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is `n - 1`, and `counter` is between 1 and `n` inclusive. If `work` is True, then if `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`, then `work` is False. Otherwise, `work` is True. If `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a`, then `ans` is a string of length 2. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1. If `work` is False, then `ans` is a string of length 1 equal to the first character of `b`, `i` is 1, `work` is False, and `j` is `n - 1`.***
