Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a binary string of length `n` that must have at least 3 characters, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string consisting of characters from `a` and `b`, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is either True or False, `j` is 2, and if `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]`, then `counter` is either 3 or 4, otherwise, `counter` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `counter` has been incremented by 1. If `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]`, then `counter` was either 2 or 3, and now it is either 3 or 4. If `a[j + 1]` is not equal to `b[j]`, then `counter` was 1, and now it is 2. The values of the other variables remain the same.
