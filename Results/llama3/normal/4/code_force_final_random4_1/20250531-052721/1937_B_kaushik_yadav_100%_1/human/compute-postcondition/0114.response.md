The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `a`. If `j` is less than `len(a) - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `a` is a binary string of length `n`. For the loop to execute again `j` must be increased by 1 so `j` is 1 and `a` is still a binary string of length `n`.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string of length `n`, `i` is `n`, `work` is False, `j` is 1, `counter` is 1 or 2**
