Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string of length `n`, `i` is `n`, `work` is False, `counter` is 1, `j` is not defined, and the string `ans` of length `n` is being printed
Code of the loop:
for j in range(len(a) - 1):
    if a[j + 1] == b[j]:
        counter += 1
    elif a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1':
        counter = 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string of length `n`, `i` is `n`, `work` is False, `j` is 0. If the character at index `j + 1` in string `a` is equal to the character at index `j` in string `b`, then `counter` is 2. Otherwise, if `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', then the current values of `a[j + 1]` and `b[j]` are maintained and `counter` is 1. In all other cases, either `a[j + 1]` is not equal to '0' or `b[j]` is not equal to '1', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `counter` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string of length `n`, `i` is `n`, `work` is False, `j` is 1. If `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]`, then `counter` is 2 or 3. If `a[j + 1]` is not equal to `b[j]`, then if `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', `counter` is 1, otherwise `counter` is 1 or 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string of length `n`, `i` is `n`, `work` is False, `j` is 2. If `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]`, then `counter` is either 2, 3, or 4 depending on the values of `a[j + 1]` and `b[j]`. Otherwise, if `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', then `counter` is 1. In all other cases, `counter` is either 1, 2, or 3 depending on the values of `a[j + 1]` and `b[j]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
