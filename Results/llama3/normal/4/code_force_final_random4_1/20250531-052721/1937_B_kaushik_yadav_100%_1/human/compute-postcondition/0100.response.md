Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string of length `n`, `i` is `n`, `work` is False, `j` is not defined, `counter` is not defined, and stdin is empty.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `t` remains an integer greater than 1, `n` remains an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` and `b` remain binary strings of length `n`, `ans` becomes a string of length `n`, `i` becomes `n`, `work` becomes False, and `j` and `counter` remain undefined. The stdin remains empty.
