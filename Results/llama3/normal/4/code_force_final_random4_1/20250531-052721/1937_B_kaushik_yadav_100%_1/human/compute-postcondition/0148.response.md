Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string of length 2, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is `n - 1`, `counter` is between 1 and `n` inclusive, and `work` is False.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `work` that is assigned the value False. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
