Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a binary string of length greater than 3 if `i` is 3, or a binary string of length 3 if `i` is less than 3, `b` is a binary string of length `n`. If `work` is True, then `i` is either 2 or 3, `work` is either False if the current value of `b` at index 1 is less than the current value of `a` at index 2, or True otherwise, and `ans` is a string consisting of the first character of `a` and the character at index 1 of `a` if `work` is True, or the first character of `b` if `work` is False, and the character at index 2 of `b` if `i` is 2, otherwise `ans` is a string consisting of the first character of `a` and the character at index 1 of `a` if `work` is True, or the first character of `b` if `work` is False, and the character at index `i` of `a`. If `work` is False, then `i` is 2, `work` is either False if the current value of `b` at index `i` is less than the current value of `a` at index `i` + 1, or True otherwise, and `ans` is a string consisting of the first character of `a` and the character of `b` at index `i`, and the character at index `i` of `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains an integer greater than 0, and the value of `n` remains an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive. The value of `a` remains a binary string of length greater than 3 if `i` is 3, or a binary string of length 3 if `i` is less than 3, and the value of `b` remains a binary string of length `n`. The value of `ans` is updated by appending the character at index `i` of `a` to its current value. The value of `i` and `work` remains the same as before, with `i` being either 2 or 3, and `work` being either False if the current value of `b` at index 1 is less than the current value of `a` at index 2, or True otherwise.
