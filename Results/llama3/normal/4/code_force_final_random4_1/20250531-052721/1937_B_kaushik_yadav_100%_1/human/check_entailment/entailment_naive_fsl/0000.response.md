Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when the lexicographically smallest string is not the one that can be attained by always choosing the top or bottom path. For example, consider the input:

3
2
10
01

The lexicographically smallest string is "010", but the program will output "100" which is incorrect. The program assumes that the lexicographically smallest string can always be attained by choosing the top or bottom path, which is not always the case.
