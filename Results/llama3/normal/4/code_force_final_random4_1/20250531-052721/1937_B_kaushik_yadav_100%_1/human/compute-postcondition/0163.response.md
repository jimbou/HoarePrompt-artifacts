Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string of length either 2, 3, or 4, `i` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `j` is `n - 1`, and `counter` is between 1 and `n` inclusive. If `work` is True, then `ans` is a string of length either 3 or 4. If `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`, then `work` is False and `ans` is a string of length 3, `i` is either 1 or 2, and `counter` is between 1 and `n` inclusive. If `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, then `ans` is a string of length 4. Otherwise, if `i` is less than the length of `a` and `b[i - 1]` is less than `a[i]`, then `work` is False and `ans` is a string of length 3, `i` is either 2 or 3, and `counter` is between 1 and `n` inclusive. Otherwise, `ans` is a string of length 3. If `work` is False, then `ans` is a string of length either 2 or 3. If `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`, then `ans` is a string of length 2, `i` is either 2 or 3, and `counter` is between 1 and `n` inclusive. Otherwise, if `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, then `ans` is a string of length 3. Otherwise, `ans` is a string of length 2.***
