Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string of length 2, `i` is either 1 or 2, `j` is `n - 1`, and `counter` is between 1 and `n` inclusive**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it can now be either 1 or 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
