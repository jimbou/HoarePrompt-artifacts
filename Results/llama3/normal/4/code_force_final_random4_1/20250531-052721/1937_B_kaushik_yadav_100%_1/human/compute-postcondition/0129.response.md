To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` (which is a throwaway variable) and `t`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be decremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string of length `n`, `i` is `n`, `work` is False, `j` is `n - 1`, and `counter` is between 1 and `n` inclusive**
