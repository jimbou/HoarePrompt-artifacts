Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a binary string of length `n` that must have at least 2 characters, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string of length `n`, `i` is `n`, `j` is 0, `counter` is 1, the string `ans` of length `n` is being printed, `a[j + 1]` is not equal to `b[j]`, and it is not the case that `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1'***
