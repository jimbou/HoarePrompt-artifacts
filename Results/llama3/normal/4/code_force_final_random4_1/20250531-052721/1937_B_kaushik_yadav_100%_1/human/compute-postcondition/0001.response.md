To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t`, as it is the only variable in the loop head. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0.

State: **stdin contains multiple test cases with two inputs remaining for each test case: two binary strings of the same length. The length of the strings is equal to the integer that was previously read. The integer is greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5. The sum of the lengths of the strings over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, t is an integer greater than 0**
