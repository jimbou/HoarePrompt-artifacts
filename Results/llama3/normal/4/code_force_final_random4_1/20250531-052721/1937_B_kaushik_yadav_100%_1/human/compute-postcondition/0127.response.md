Based on the initial state, the print statement will print the value of the variable `counter`.

The variable `counter` is described as being between 1 and `n` inclusive, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive.

Since the exact value of `counter` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `counter`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the current value of `counter`.

Output: **counter (where counter is an integer between 1 and n inclusive)**
