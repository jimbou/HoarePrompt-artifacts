To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `a`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `len(a) - 1` is at least 1, meaning `a` must have at least 2 characters. Since `j` is used as the loop variable, it should be initialized to 0, which is the starting index of the range.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a binary string of length `n` that must have at least 2 characters, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string of length `n`, `i` is `n`, `j` is 0, and `counter` is 1, and the string `ans` of length `n` is being printed**
