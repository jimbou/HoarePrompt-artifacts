Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string consisting of characters from `a` and `b`, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is either True or False, `counter` is 1, and stdin contains multiple test cases with no inputs remaining for the current test case, and the string `ans` consisting of characters from `a` and `b` is being printed.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(len(a) - 1):
    if a[j + 1] == b[j]:
        counter += 1
    elif a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1':
        counter = 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a binary string of length `n` that must have at least 2 characters, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string consisting of characters from `a` and `b`, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is either True or False, `counter` is either 1 or 2, and `j` is 0. If the character at index `j + 1` in string `a` is equal to the character at index `j` in string `b`, then `counter` is 2. Otherwise, if the character at index `j + 1` in string `a` is '0' and the character at index `j` in string `b` is '1', then the current values of `a[j + 1]` and `b[j]` are maintained and `counter` is 1. In all other cases, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a binary string of length `n` that must have at least 2 characters, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string consisting of characters from `a` and `b`, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is either True or False, and `j` is 1. If `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]`, then `counter` is either 2 or 3. If `a[j + 1]` is not equal to `b[j]`, then if `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', `counter` is 1, otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a binary string of length `n` that must have at least 3 characters, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string consisting of characters from `a` and `b`, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is either True or False, and `j` is 2. If `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]`, then `counter` is either 3 or 4. If `a[j + 1]` is not equal to `b[j]`, then if `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', `counter` is 1, otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
