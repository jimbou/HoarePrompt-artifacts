Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a binary string of length `n` that must have at least 2 characters, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string of length `n` that is being printed, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is 1, `counter` is increased by 1**

In this output state, the value of `counter` has been incremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The binary strings `a` and `b` still have a length of `n`, and `ans` is still a string of length `n` being printed. The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, and `j` are also unchanged.
