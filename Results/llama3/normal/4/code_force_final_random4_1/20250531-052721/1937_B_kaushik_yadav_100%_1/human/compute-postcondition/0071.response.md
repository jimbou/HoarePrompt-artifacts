Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string of length 1, `i` is 0, `work` is False, `j` is not defined, `counter` is not defined, and stdin is empty. The current value of `i` is less than the length of `a` minus 1, and the character at index `i` in string `b` is less than the character at index `i + 1` in string `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state except that the value of `work` has been changed to False. All other variables and conditions remain the same.
