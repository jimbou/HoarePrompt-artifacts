Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a binary string of length `n` that must have at least 2 characters, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string of length `n` that is being printed, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is 0, and `counter` is 2. The current value of `a` at index `j + 1` is equal to the current value of `b` at index `j`.**

In this output state, the value of `counter` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `counter` being equal to 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
