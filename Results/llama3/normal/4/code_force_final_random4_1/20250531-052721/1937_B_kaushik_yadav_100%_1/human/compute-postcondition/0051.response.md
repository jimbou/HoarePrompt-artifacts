Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a binary string of length `n` that must have at least 2 characters, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string consisting of characters from `a` and `b`, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is either True or False, `counter` is either 2 or 3, and `j` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `counter` has been incremented by 1, so it can now be either 2 or 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
