Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string of length `n`, `i` is `n`, `work` is False, `j` is 2, `counter` is either 1, 2, or 3 depending on the values of `a[j + 1]` and `b[j]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged.
