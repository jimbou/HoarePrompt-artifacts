The `print(ans)` statement will print the string `ans` which has a length of `n`. Since the exact value of `ans` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the string `ans` of length `n`.

Output: **ans (where ans is a string of length n)**
