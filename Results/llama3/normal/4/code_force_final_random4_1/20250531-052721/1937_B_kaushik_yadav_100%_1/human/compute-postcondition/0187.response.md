Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a binary string of length `n` that must have at least 3 characters, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string of length `n` that is being printed, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is 2, `counter` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, `i`, `j`, and `counter` retain their initial values, and we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
