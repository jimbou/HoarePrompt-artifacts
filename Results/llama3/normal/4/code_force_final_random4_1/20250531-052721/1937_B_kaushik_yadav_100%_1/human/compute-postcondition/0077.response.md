Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string of length 1 or 2, `i` is 0 or 1, `work` is True, `j` is not defined, `counter` is not defined, and stdin is empty. If `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a`, then `ans` is a string of length 2. Otherwise, `i` is 1 and `ans` is a string of length 1.***
