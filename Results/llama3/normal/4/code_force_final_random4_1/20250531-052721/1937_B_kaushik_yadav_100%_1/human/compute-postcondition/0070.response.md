Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string of length 1, `i` is 0, `work` is True, `j` is not defined, `counter` is not defined, and stdin is empty. The current value of `i` is less than the length of `a` minus 1, and the character at index `i` in string `b` is less than the character at index `i + 1` in string `a`.**
