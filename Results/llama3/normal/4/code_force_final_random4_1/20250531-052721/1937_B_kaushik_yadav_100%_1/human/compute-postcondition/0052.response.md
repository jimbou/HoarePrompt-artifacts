Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a binary string of length `n` that must have at least 2 characters, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string consisting of characters from `a` and `b`, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is either True or False, `counter` is 1, and `j` is 1**

The code sets the value of `counter` to 1, so the output state reflects this change. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and properties.
