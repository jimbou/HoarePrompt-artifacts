Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string consisting of the first character of `a`, `i` is 1, `work` is True, and stdin contains multiple test cases with no inputs remaining for the current test case. Either `i` is less than the length of `a` or `i` is equal to the length of `a`**.

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition "Either `i + 1` is less than the length of `a`" has been updated to "Either `i` is less than the length of `a` or `i` is equal to the length of `a`" because `i` has been incremented.
