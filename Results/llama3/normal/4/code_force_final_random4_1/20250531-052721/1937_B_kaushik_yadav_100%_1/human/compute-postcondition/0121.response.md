Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string of length `n`, `i` is `n`, `work` is False, `j` is 2, `counter` is either 2, 3, or 4 depending on the values of `a[j + 1]` and `b[j]`.**

In this output state, the value of `counter` has been incremented by 1, so it can now be either 2, 3, or 4, depending on the values of `a[j + 1]` and `b[j]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
