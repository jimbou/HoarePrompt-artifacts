Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string of length `n`, `i` is `n`, `work` is False, `j` is 2. If `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]`, then `counter` is either 2, 3, or 4 depending on the values of `a[j + 1]` and `b[j]`. Otherwise, if `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', then `counter` is 1. In all other cases, `counter` is either 1, 2, or 3 depending on the values of `a[j + 1]` and `b[j]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
