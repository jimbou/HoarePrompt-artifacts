Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a binary string of length `n` that must have at least 2 characters, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string consisting of characters from `a` and `b`, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is either True or False, `counter` is either 1 or 2, and `j` is 1. If `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', then `counter` is 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
