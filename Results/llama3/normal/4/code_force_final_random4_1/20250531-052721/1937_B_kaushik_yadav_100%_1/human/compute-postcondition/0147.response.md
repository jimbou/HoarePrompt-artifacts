Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string of length 2, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is `n - 1`, and `counter` is between 1 and `n` inclusive**

The value of `ans` is updated by appending the character at index `i` of the binary string `a`. Since `i` is either 0 or 1, the appended character will be either the first or second character of `a`. The length of `ans` is now 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
