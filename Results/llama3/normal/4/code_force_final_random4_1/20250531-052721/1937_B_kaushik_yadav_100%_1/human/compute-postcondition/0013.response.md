Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string consisting of the first character of `a` and either the last character of `b` if `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a`, or the first character of `a` if `i + 1` is not equal to the length of `a`, `i` is either `n - 1` if `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a`, or 1 if `i + 1` is not equal to the length of `a`, `work` is True, and stdin contains multiple test cases with no inputs remaining for the current test case.***
