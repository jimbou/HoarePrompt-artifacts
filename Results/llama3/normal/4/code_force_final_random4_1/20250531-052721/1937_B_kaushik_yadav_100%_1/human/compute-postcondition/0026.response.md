Postcondition: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a binary string of length greater than 1, b is a binary string of length n. If work is True, then if i + 1 is less than the length of a and the character at index i of b is less than the character at index i + 1 of a, then i is 2, work is False, and ans is a string consisting of the first character of b. Otherwise, i is either 2 or 3, work is either False if the current value of b at index 1 is less than the current value of a at index 2, or True otherwise, and ans is a string consisting of the first character of a and the character at index 1 of a if work is True, or the first character of b if work is False, and the character at index 2 of b if i is 2, otherwise ans is a string consisting of the first character of a and the character at index 1 of a if work is True, or the first character of b if work is False. If work is False, then ans is a string consisting of the first character of a and the character of b at index i, i is 2, and work is either False if the current value of b at index i is less than the current value of a at index i + 1, or True otherwise.**
