The only variable in the loop head is variable i and a, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i and a.  If i is less than the length of a, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is 0 or 1 and a is a binary string of length n, So for the loop to be executed one more time i must be 0 and a must be a binary string of length greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a binary string of length greater than 1, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string of length 1 or 2, `i` is 0, `work` is True or False, `j` is not defined, `counter` is not defined, and stdin is empty.**
