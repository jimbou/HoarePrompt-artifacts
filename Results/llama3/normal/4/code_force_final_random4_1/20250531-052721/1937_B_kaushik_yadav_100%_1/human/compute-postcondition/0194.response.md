Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer and two binary strings of the same length. It then generates a new string by combining the two input strings in a specific way, based on the values of the characters in the strings, and prints this new string. Additionally, it counts the number of consecutive positions where the second string has a '1' and the first string has a '0', and prints this count. The function processes all test cases and prints the results for each case.**
