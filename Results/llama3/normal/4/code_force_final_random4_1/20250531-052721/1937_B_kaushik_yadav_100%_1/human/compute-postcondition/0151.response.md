Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string of length either 2 or 3, `i` is either 0, 1, or 2, `j` is `n - 1`, and `counter` is between 1 and `n` inclusive. If `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, then `ans` is a string of length 3. Otherwise, `ans` is a string of length 2.***
