Precondition: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: first an integer, then two binary strings of the same length. The length of the strings is equal to the integer. The integer is greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5. The sum of the lengths of the strings over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
