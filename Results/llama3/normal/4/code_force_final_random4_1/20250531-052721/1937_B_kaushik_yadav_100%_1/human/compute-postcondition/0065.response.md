The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is equal to the length of `a` and `t` is an integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`. 
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string consisting of characters from `a` and `b`, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is either True or False, `j` is equal to `n - 1`, and `counter` is either 1 or greater than 1**
