The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is 0, so the new value of `i` is 1. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a binary string of length greater than 1, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string of length 2 or 3, `i` is 1, `work` is True or False, `j` is not defined, `counter` is not defined, and stdin is empty.**
