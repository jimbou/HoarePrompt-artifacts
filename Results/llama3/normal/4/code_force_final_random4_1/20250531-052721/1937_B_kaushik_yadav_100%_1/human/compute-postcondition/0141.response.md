Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string of length 1 or 2, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is `n - 1`, and `counter` is between 1 and `n` inclusive. The current value of `work` is True. Either `i + 1` is not less than the length of `a`, or `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`. If `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a`, then `ans` is a string of length 2. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1.***
