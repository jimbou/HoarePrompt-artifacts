The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is 2, so the new value of `i` is 3. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a binary string of length greater than 1, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `i` is 3, `work` is either `False` if the current value of `b` at index 1 is less than the current value of `a` at index 2, or `True` otherwise, `ans` is a string consisting of the first character of `a` and the character at index 1 of `a` if `work` is `True`, or the first character of `b` if `work` is `False`.**
