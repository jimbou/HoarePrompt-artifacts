Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `n`, `ans` is a string consisting of the first character of `a`, `i` is 0, `work` is False, and stdin contains multiple test cases with no inputs remaining for the current test case. The current value of `i` is less than the length of `a` minus 1, and the current value of `b` at index `i` is less than the current value of `a` at index `i + 1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `work` has been changed to False, while all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `t` is still greater than 0, `n` is still between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` and `b` are still binary strings of length `n`, `ans` is still a string consisting of the first character of `a`, and `i` is still 0. The condition that the current value of `i` is less than the length of `a` minus 1 and the current value of `b` at index `i` is less than the current value of `a` at index `i + 1` is still valid.
