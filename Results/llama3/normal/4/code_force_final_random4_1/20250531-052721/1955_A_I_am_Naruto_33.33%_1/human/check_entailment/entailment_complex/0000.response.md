Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts.

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. If `n` is greater than 1, it calculates two possible costs:
   - `ans1`: The cost of buying `n` yogurts at the regular price `a`.
   - `ans2`: The cost of buying `n` yogurts using the promotion price `b`. This is calculated by dividing `n` by 2 (to get the number of pairs of yogurts), multiplying by `b` (to get the cost of the pairs), and adding the cost of any remaining yogurt (if `n` is odd).
4. It then prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.
5. If `n` is 1, it simply prints the value of `a`, since there is no promotion for buying a single yogurt.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the minimum cost for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
