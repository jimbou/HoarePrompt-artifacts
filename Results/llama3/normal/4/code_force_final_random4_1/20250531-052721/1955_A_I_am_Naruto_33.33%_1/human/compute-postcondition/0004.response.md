Based on the precondition, we know that `ans1` is a multiple of `a` and `n`, and `ans2` is equal to `(b * n // 2) + (a * n % 2)`. We also know that `n` is higher than 1.

When the `print` statement is executed, it will print the minimum value between `ans1` and `ans2`. Since `ans1` is a multiple of `a` and `n`, and `n` is higher than 1, `ans1` will be a larger value compared to `ans2`. Therefore, the minimum value will be `ans2`.

Output: **(b * n // 2) + (a * n % 2)**
