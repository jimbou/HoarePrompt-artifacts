Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. 

For each test case, it calculates two possible costs: 
- `ans1` is the cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price (a * n).
- `ans2` is the cost of buying n yogurts with the promotion (b * n // 2 + a * n % 2). This is calculated by buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price (b * n // 2), and then buying any remaining yogurts at the regular price (a * n % 2).

It then prints the minimum of these two costs. If n is 1, it simply prints the regular price (a), as there is no promotion for buying a single yogurt.

Correctness: **True**
