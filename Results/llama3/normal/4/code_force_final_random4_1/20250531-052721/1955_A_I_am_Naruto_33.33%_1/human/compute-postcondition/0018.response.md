The only variable in the loop head is the variable `_` and `int(input())`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `int(input())`. If `int(input())` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `int(input())` is 1. So for the loop to execute again `int(input())` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 1, ans1 and ans2 are defined, a is defined**
