The function reads a series of inputs from standard input, where the first input is an integer t representing the number of test cases, followed by t sets of three integers n, a, and b. For each test case, if n is greater than 1, it calculates and prints the minimum of two values: a multiplied by n, and b multiplied by n divided by 2 plus a multiplied by n modulo 2. If n is 1, it simply prints the value of a. The function iterates this process t times, printing the results for each test case.
