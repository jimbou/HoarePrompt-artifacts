Output State: **a is undefined, b is undefined, n is undefined, ans1 is undefined, ans2 is undefined**

The code snippet consists of two lines that attempt to perform arithmetic operations on variables `a`, `b`, and `n`. However, the initial state indicates that a ValueError is raised because the input() function returns a single integer `t`, which cannot be split into three integers. This implies that the variables `a`, `b`, and `n` are not defined or initialized with any values.

The first line `ans1 = a * n` attempts to multiply `a` and `n`, but since `a` and `n` are undefined, `ans1` will also be undefined.

The second line `ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2` attempts to perform more complex arithmetic operations involving `a`, `b`, and `n`. However, since `a`, `b`, and `n` are undefined, the entire expression will be undefined, and `ans2` will also be undefined.

In summary, the code snippet does not provide any meaningful results due to the undefined state of the variables involved. The output state reflects this, indicating that all variables remain undefined after the code execution.
