Postcondition: **A ValueError is raised because the input() function returns a single integer t, which cannot be split into three integers. The values of the variables _ and input() are not affected. If the current value of n is higher than 1, ans1 is a multiple of a and n, ans2 is equal to (b * n // 2) + (a * n % 2), and the minimum of ans1 and ans2 is printed. Otherwise, if n is less than or equal to 1, the value of a is printed.**
