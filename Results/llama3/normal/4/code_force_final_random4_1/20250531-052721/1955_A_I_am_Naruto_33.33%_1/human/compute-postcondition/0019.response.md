Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, ans1 and ans2 are defined, stdin contains a space-separated list of three integers**.

In this output state, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to be the three integers input from the user, and the values of `ans1` and `ans2` remain unchanged. The stdin is now empty since it has been used to input the three integers.
