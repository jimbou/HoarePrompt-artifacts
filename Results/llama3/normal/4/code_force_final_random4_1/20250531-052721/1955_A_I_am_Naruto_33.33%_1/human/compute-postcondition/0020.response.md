The code snippet provided consists of two lines, each assigning a value to the variables `ans1` and `ans2`, respectively. The values of `ans1` and `ans2` are calculated based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `n`, which are defined in the initial state.

The first line assigns the value of `a * n` to `ans1`. Since `a` and `n` are integers, `ans1` will also be an integer.

The second line assigns the value of `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2` to `ans2`. This expression involves integer division (`//`) and modulus (`%`) operations. The result of `b * n // 2` will be an integer, and the result of `a * n % 2` will be either 0 or 1 (since `a` and `n` are integers). Therefore, `ans2` will also be an integer.

Since the code only modifies the values of `ans1` and `ans2`, the values of `a`, `b`, and `n` remain unchanged. The stdin input is not used in this code snippet, so its state remains the same.

Output State: **a is an integer, b is an integer, n is an integer, ans1 is an integer equal to a * n, ans2 is an integer equal to b * n // 2 + a * n % 2, stdin contains a space-separated list of three integers**
