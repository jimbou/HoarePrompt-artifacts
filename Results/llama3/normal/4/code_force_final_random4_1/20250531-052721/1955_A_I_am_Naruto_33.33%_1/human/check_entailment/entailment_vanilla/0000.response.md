Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts, considering the promotion where two yogurts can be bought for b burles.

2. The given program defines a function `func()` that iterates over the number of test cases specified in the input.

3. For each test case, it reads the number of yogurts (n), the price for one yogurt (a), and the price for two yogurts on promotion (b).

4. If n is greater than 1, the program calculates two possible costs:
   - `ans1`: The cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price (a * n).
   - `ans2`: The cost of buying n yogurts using the promotion, where the number of pairs of yogurts is `n // 2` and the remaining yogurt (if any) is bought at the regular price (a * n % 2).

5. The program then prints the minimum cost between `ans1` and `ans2`.

6. If n is 1, the program simply prints the price of one yogurt (a).

7. The program correctly handles the cases where n is 1 and where n is greater than 1, considering both the regular price and the promotion.

8. The program uses the `min()` function to find the minimum cost, ensuring that the optimal solution is chosen.

9. The program does not contain any syntax errors or logical flaws.

10. The program's output matches the expected output for the provided example inputs.

Correctness: **True**
