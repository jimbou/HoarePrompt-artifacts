Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains t+1 inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) and then t sets of three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if n > 1:
        ans1 = a * n
        ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2
        print(min(ans1, ans2))
    else:
        print(a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: A ValueError is raised because the input() function returns a single integer t, which cannot be split into three integers. The values of the variables _ and input() are not affected. If the current value of n is higher than 1, ans1 is a multiple of a and n, ans2 is equal to (b * n // 2) + (a * n % 2), and the minimum of ans1 and ans2 is printed. Otherwise, if n is less than or equal to 1, the value of a is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *If n > 1, the minimum value between ans1 and ans2 is printed. Otherwise, a ValueError is raised because the input() function returns a single integer t, which cannot be split into three integers, and the value of undefined variable a is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n`, `a`, `b` are integers, ans1 and ans2 are defined, stdin contains a space-separated list of three integers. If `n` > 1, the minimum of `a * n` and `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2` is printed. If `n` is 1, the value of `a` is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
