Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost of buying n yogurts at "Vosmiorochka". 

Here's why:

- The program iterates over each test case, reading the values of n, a, and b.
- If n is greater than 1, it calculates the cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price (a * n) and the cost of buying n yogurts with the promotion (b * n // 2 + a * n % 2). It then prints the minimum of these two costs.
- If n is 1, it simply prints the cost of buying one yogurt at the regular price (a).

The logic is sound, and the program correctly handles all possible cases. 

Correctness: **True**
