Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. It considers two cases: buying all yogurts at the regular price (a * n) and buying yogurts in pairs at the promotion price (b * n // 2 + a * n % 2). The program then prints the minimum of these two cases.

The program handles all potential cases correctly:

* If n is 1, it simply prints the price of one yogurt (a).
* If n is greater than 1, it calculates the minimum cost by considering the two cases mentioned above.
* The program handles cases where n is even and odd correctly, as the expression b * n // 2 + a * n % 2 correctly calculates the cost of buying yogurts in pairs at the promotion price, with any remaining yogurt being bought at the regular price.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly.
