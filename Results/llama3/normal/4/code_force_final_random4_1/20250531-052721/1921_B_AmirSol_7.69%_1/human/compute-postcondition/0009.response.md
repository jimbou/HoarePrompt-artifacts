The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` was 0, so the new value of `i` is 1. The other variables are not affected. The character at index i in s1 is still equal to the character at index i in s2, but now i is 1. The Output State is: n is a positive integer, s1 and s2 are strings of n characters consisting of '0's and '1's, counter is 0, i is 1, and the character at index i in s1 is equal to the character at index i in s2.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, s1 and s2 are strings of n characters consisting of '0's and '1's, counter is 0, i is 1, and the character at index i in s1 is equal to the character at index i in s2.**
