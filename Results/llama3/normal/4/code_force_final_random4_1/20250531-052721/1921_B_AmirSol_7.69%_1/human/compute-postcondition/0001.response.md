According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. Since `i` is 0 and `n` is a positive integer, the loop can certainly execute at least one time. Therefore, no state adjustments are needed.

State: **n is a positive integer, s1 and s2 are strings of n characters consisting of '0's and '1's, counter is 0, i is 0**
