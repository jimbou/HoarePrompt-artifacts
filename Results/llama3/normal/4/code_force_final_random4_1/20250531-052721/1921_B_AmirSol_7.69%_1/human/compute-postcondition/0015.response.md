Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and `n` is greater than 2, `s1` and `s2` are strings of `n` characters consisting of '0's and '1's. If `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, then `counter` is 1, and either `i` is 2 and the current value of `s1[i]` is equal to the current value of `s2[i]`, or `i` is 3 and the current value of `s1[i]` is not equal to the current value of `s2[i]`. Otherwise, `counter` is 0, `i` is 2, and the character at index `i` in `s1` is equal to the character at index `i` in `s2`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `counter`, `s1`, and `s2` are still valid, but the index `i` has moved one position forward.
