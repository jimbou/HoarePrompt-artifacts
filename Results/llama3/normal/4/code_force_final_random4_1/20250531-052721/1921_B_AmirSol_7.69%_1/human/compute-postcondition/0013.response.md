Output State: **n is a positive integer and n is greater than 2, s1 and s2 are strings of n characters consisting of '0's and '1's. If s1[i] is not equal to s2[i], then counter is 2, and either i is 2 and the current value of s1[i] is equal to the current value of s2[i], or i is 3 and the current value of s1[i] is not equal to the current value of s2[i]. Otherwise, counter is 1, i is 2, and the character at index i in s1 is equal to the character at index i in s2.**

In this output state, the value of `counter` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `i` has been incremented by 1. The conditions for the values of `s1` and `s2` remain the same, but the index `i` has changed. If `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, then `counter` is 2, and either `i` is 2 and the current value of `s1[i]` is equal to the current value of `s2[i]`, or `i` is 3 and the current value of `s1[i]` is not equal to the current value of `s2[i]`. Otherwise, `counter` is 1, `i` is 2, and the character at index `i` in `s1` is equal to the character at index `i` in `s2`.
