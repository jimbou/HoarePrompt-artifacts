According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 or 2, and `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`, so `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **n is a positive integer and n is greater than 2, s1 and s2 are strings of n characters consisting of '0's and '1's. If s1[i] is not equal to s2[i], then counter is 1, and either i is 1 and the current value of s1[i] is equal to the current value of s2[i], or i is 2 and the current value of s1[i] is not equal to the current value of s2[i]. Otherwise, counter is 0, i is 1, and the character at index i in s1 is equal to the character at index i in s2.**
