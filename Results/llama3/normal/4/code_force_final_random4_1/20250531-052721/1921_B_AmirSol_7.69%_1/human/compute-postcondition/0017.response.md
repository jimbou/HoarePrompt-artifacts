The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer and `n` is greater than 2, `i` is not specified. `n` being greater than 2 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than `i`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer and `n` is greater than `i`, `s1` and `s2` are strings of `n` characters consisting of '0's and '1's. If `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, then `counter` is 2 if `i` is 2 and the current value of `s1[i]` is equal to the current value of `s2[i]`, or `i` is 3 and the current value of `s1[i]` is not equal to the current value of `s2[i]`, or `i` is 3 and the current value of `s1[i]` is equal to the current value of `s2[i]`, or `i` is 4 and the current value of `s1[i]` is not equal to the current value of `s2[i]`. Otherwise, `counter` is 1 if `i` is 2 and the character at index `i` in `s1` is equal to the character at index `i` in `s2`, or `i` is 3 and the character at index `i` in `s1` is equal to the character at index `i` in `s2`. Otherwise, `counter` is 0 if `i` is 2 and the character at index `i` in `s1` is equal to the character at index `i` in `s2`.**
