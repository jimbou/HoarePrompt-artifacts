Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and `n` is greater than `i`, `s1` and `s2` are strings of `n` characters consisting of '0's and '1's. If `s1[i-1]` is not equal to `s2[i-1]`, then `counter` is 2 if `i-1` is 2 and the current value of `s1[i-1]` is equal to the current value of `s2[i-1]`, or `i-1` is 3 and the current value of `s1[i-1]` is not equal to the current value of `s2[i-1]`, or `i-1` is 3 and the current value of `s1[i-1]` is equal to the current value of `s2[i-1]`, or `i-1` is 4 and the current value of `s1[i-1]` is not equal to the current value of `s2[i-1]`. Otherwise, `counter` is 1 if `i-1` is 2 and the character at index `i-1` in `s1` is equal to the character at index `i-1` in `s2`, or `i-1` is 3 and the character at index `i-1` in `s1` is equal to the character at index `i-1` in `s2`. Otherwise, `counter` is 0 if `i-1` is 2 and the character at index `i-1` in `s1` is equal to the character at index `i-1` in `s2`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` has been incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `s1`, and `s2` remain the same. The condition for `counter` is now based on the previous value of `i` (i.e., `i-1`).
