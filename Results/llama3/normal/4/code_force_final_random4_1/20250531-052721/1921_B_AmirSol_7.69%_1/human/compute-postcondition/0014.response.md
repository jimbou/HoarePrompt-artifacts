Postcondition: **n is a positive integer and n is greater than 2, s1 and s2 are strings of n characters consisting of '0's and '1's. If s1[i] is not equal to s2[i], then counter is 2, and either i is 2 and the current value of s1[i] is equal to the current value of s2[i], or i is 3 and the current value of s1[i] is not equal to the current value of s2[i], or i is 3 and the current value of s1[i] is equal to the current value of s2[i], or i is 4 and the current value of s1[i] is not equal to the current value of s2[i]. Otherwise, counter is 1, i is 2, and the character at index i in s1 is equal to the character at index i in s2, or i is 3, and the character at index i in s1 is equal to the character at index i in s2.**
