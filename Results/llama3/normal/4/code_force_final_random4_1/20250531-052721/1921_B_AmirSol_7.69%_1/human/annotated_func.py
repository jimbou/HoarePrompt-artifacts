#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, s1 and s2 are strings of n characters consisting of '0's and '1's.
    counter = 0
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if s1[i] != s2[i]:
            if i < n - 1 and s1[i + 1] != s2[i + 1] and s1[i] != s1[i + 1]:
                counter += 1
                i += 2
            else:
                counter += 1
                i += 1
        else:
            i += 1
        
    #State: counter is the number of mismatched pairs of characters in s1 and s2, i is n
    return counter
    #The program returns the number of mismatched pairs of characters in strings s1 and s2.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function compares two strings of equal length, consisting of '0's and '1's, and returns the number of mismatched pairs of characters. A pair is considered mismatched if the characters at the current and next positions in both strings are different. The function iterates through the strings, incrementing a counter each time a mismatched pair is found, and returns the total count of such pairs.
