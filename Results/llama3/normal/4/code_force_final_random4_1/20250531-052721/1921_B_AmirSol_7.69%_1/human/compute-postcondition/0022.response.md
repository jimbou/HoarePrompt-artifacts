Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer and `n` is greater than `i`, `s1` and `s2` are strings of `n` characters consisting of '0's and '1's. If `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, then `counter` is increased by 1 and `i` is increased by 2 if `i` is less than `n - 1` and `s1[i + 1]` is not equal to `s2[i + 1]` and `s1[i]` is not equal to `s1[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `counter` is 3 if `i` is 2 and the current value of `s1[i]` is equal to the current value of `s2[i]`, or `i` is 3 and the current value of `s1[i]` is not equal to the current value of `s2[i]`, or `i` is 3 and the current value of `s1[i]` is equal to the current value of `s2[i]`, or `i` is 4 and the current value of `s1[i]` is not equal to the current value of `s2[i]`. Otherwise, `counter` is 2 if `i` is 2 and the character at index `i` in `s1` is equal to the character at index `i` in `s2`, or `i` is 3 and the character at index `i` in `s1` is equal to the character at index `i` in `s2`. Otherwise, `counter` is 1 if `i` is 2 and the character at index `i` in `s1` is equal to the character at index `i` in `s2`. In all cases, `i` is increased by 1. If `s1[i]` is equal to `s2[i]`, then `counter` is 2 if `i-1` is 2 and the current value of `s1[i-1]` is equal to the current value of `s2[i-1]`, or `i-1` is 3 and the current value of `s1[i-1]` is not equal to the current value of `s2[i-1]`, or `i-1` is 3 and the current value of `s1[i-1]` is equal to the current value of `s2[i-1]`, or `i-1` is 4 and the current value of `s1[i-1]` is not equal to the current value of `s2[i-1]`. Otherwise, `counter` is 1 if `i-1` is 2 and the character at index `i-1` in `s1` is equal to the character at index `i-1` in `s2`, or `i-1` is 3 and the character at index `i-1` in `s1` is equal to the character at index `i-1` in `s2`. Otherwise, `counter` is 0 if `i-1` is 2 and the character at index `i-1` in `s1` is equal to the character at index `i-1` in `s2`.**
