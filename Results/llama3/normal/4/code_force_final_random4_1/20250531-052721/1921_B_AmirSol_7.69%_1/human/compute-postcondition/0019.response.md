Output State: **n is a positive integer and n is greater than i, s1 and s2 are strings of n characters consisting of '0's and '1's. If s1[i] is not equal to s2[i], then counter is 3 if i is 2 and the current value of s1[i] is equal to the current value of s2[i], or i is 3 and the current value of s1[i] is not equal to the current value of s2[i], or i is 3 and the current value of s1[i] is equal to the current value of s2[i], or i is 4 and the current value of s1[i] is not equal to the current value of s2[i]. Otherwise, counter is 2 if i is 2 and the character at index i in s1 is equal to the character at index i in s2, or i is 3 and the character at index i in s1 is equal to the character at index i in s2. Otherwise, counter is 1 if i is 2 and the character at index i in s1 is equal to the character at index i in s2. i is i plus 1.**

The code increments the value of `counter` by 1 and then increments the value of `i` by 1. The value of `counter` depends on the values of `s1[i]` and `s2[i]`, and the value of `i`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so its new value is `i + 1`. The values of `n`, `s1`, and `s2` remain unchanged.
