Output State: **n is a positive integer and n is greater than i, s1 and s2 are strings of n characters consisting of '0's and '1's. The value of counter is increased by 1. The value of i is increased by 2.**

In this output state, the value of `counter` is increased by 1, and the value of `i` is increased by 2. The values of `n`, `s1`, and `s2` remain unchanged. The relationship between `n` and `i` remains the same, with `n` being greater than `i`. The strings `s1` and `s2` still consist of `n` characters, which are '0's and '1's.
