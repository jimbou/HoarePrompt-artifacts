Functionality: **This function compares two strings of equal length, consisting of '0's and '1's, and returns the number of mismatched pairs of characters. A pair is considered mismatched if the characters at the current and next positions in both strings are different. The function iterates through the strings, incrementing a counter each time a mismatched pair is found, and returns the total count of such pairs.**
