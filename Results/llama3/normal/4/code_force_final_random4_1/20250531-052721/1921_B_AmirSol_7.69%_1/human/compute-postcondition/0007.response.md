Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, s1 and s2 are strings of n characters consisting of '0's and '1's. If i is less than n-1, s1[i+1] is not equal to s2[i+1], and s1[i] is not equal to s1[i+1], then counter is 1, i is 2, and the current value of s1[i] is not equal to the current value of s2[i]. Otherwise, counter is 1, i is 1, and either i is not less than n-1, or s1[i+1] is equal to s2[i+1], or s1[i] is equal to s1[i+1], and the current value of s1[i] is equal to the current value of s2[i].***
