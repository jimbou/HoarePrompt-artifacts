Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, s1 and s2 are strings of n characters consisting of '0's and '1's, counter is 0, i is 0
Code of the loop:
while i < n:
    if s1[i] != s2[i]:
        if i < n - 1 and s1[i + 1] != s2[i + 1] and s1[i] != s1[i + 1]:
            counter += 1
            i += 2
        else:
            counter += 1
            i += 1
    else:
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is a positive integer, s1 and s2 are strings of n characters consisting of '0's and '1's. If s1[i] is not equal to s2[i], then counter is 1, and either i is 1 and the current value of s1[i] is equal to the current value of s2[i], or i is 2 and the current value of s1[i] is not equal to the current value of s2[i]. Otherwise, counter is 0, i is 1, and the character at index i in s1 is equal to the character at index i in s2.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is a positive integer and `n` is greater than 2, `s1` and `s2` are strings of `n` characters consisting of '0's and '1's. If `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, then `counter` is 2 if `i` is 2 and the current value of `s1[i]` is equal to the current value of `s2[i]`, or `i` is 3 and the current value of `s1[i]` is not equal to the current value of `s2[i]`, or `i` is 3 and the current value of `s1[i]` is equal to the current value of `s2[i]`, or `i` is 4 and the current value of `s1[i]` is not equal to the current value of `s2[i]`. Otherwise, `counter` is 1 if `i` is 2 and the character at index `i` in `s1` is equal to the character at index `i` in `s2`, or `i` is 3 and the character at index `i` in `s1` is equal to the character at index `i` in `s2`. Otherwise, `counter` is 0 if `i` is 2 and the character at index `i` in `s1` is equal to the character at index `i` in `s2`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is a positive integer and `n` is greater than `i`, `s1` and `s2` are strings of `n` characters consisting of '0's and '1's. If `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, then `counter` is increased by 1 and `i` is increased by 2 if `i` is less than `n - 1` and `s1[i + 1]` is not equal to `s2[i + 1]` and `s1[i]` is not equal to `s1[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `counter` is 3 if `i` is 2 and the current value of `s1[i]` is equal to the current value of `s2[i]`, or `i` is 3 and the current value of `s1[i]` is not equal to the current value of `s2[i]`, or `i` is 3 and the current value of `s1[i]` is equal to the current value of `s2[i]`, or `i` is 4 and the current value of `s1[i]` is not equal to the current value of `s2[i]`. Otherwise, `counter` is 2 if `i` is 2 and the character at index `i` in `s1` is equal to the character at index `i` in `s2`, or `i` is 3 and the character at index `i` in `s1` is equal to the character at index `i` in `s2`. Otherwise, `counter` is 1 if `i` is 2 and the character at index `i` in `s1` is equal to the character at index `i` in `s2`. In all cases, `i` is increased by 1. If `s1[i]` is equal to `s2[i]`, then `counter` is 2 if `i-1` is 2 and the current value of `s1[i-1]` is equal to the current value of `s2[i-1]`, or `i-1` is 3 and the current value of `s1[i-1]` is not equal to the current value of `s2[i-1]`, or `i-1` is 3 and the current value of `s1[i-1]` is equal to the current value of `s2[i-1]`, or `i-1` is 4 and the current value of `s1[i-1]` is not equal to the current value of `s2[i-1]`. Otherwise, `counter` is 1 if `i-1` is 2 and the character at index `i-1` in `s1` is equal to the character at index `i-1` in `s2`, or `i-1` is 3 and the character at index `i-1` in `s1` is equal to the character at index `i-1` in `s2`. Otherwise, `counter` is 0 if `i-1` is 2 and the character at index `i-1` in `s1` is equal to the character at index `i-1` in `s2`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
