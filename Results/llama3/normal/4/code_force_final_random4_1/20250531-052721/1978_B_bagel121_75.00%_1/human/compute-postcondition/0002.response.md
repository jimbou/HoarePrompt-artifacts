Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `_` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9)**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to be the first set of three integers from the input, and the stdin now contains `t-1` lines of input. The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged.
