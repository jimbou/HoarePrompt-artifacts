Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, _ is 1, t is greater than 1, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer equal to the minimum of b - a + 1 and n, ans is an integer equal to the sum of the arithmetic series from b - k + 1 to b, p2 is an integer equal to (n - k) times a, stdin contains t-4 lines of input, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9).**

The code snippet first assigns the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n` to `k`. Then, it calculates the sum of the arithmetic series from `b - k + 1` to `b` and assigns it to `ans`. Finally, it calculates the product of `(n - k)` and `a` and assigns it to `p2`. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, and `stdin` still contains `t-4` lines of input, each with three integers.
