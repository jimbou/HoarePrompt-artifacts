The only variables in the loop head are variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be increased by 1 and `t` must be decreased by 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `_` is 1, `t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains t-2 lines of input, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9). If a is greater than or equal to b, the product of n and a is being printed. Otherwise, the sum of ans and p2 is being printed.**
