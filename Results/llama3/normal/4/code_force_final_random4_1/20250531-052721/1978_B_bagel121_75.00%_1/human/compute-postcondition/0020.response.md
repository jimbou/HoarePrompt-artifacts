Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `_` is 2, `t` must be greater than 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains `t-3` lines of input, each containing three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9)**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` have been updated to the next line of input from stdin, which contains three integers. The stdin now contains `t-3` lines of input, each containing three integers. The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged.
