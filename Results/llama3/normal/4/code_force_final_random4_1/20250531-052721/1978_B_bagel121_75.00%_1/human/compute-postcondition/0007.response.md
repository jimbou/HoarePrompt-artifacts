Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, _ is 0, t must be greater than 0, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9, ans is an integer between 1 and 10^18, p2 is an integer between 1 and 10^18, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9), a is less than b**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The variable `k` is assigned the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^9. The variable `ans` is assigned the value of the sum of the arithmetic series with `k` terms, first term `b - k + 1`, and last term `b`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^18. The variable `p2` is assigned the value of the product of `n - k` and `a`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^18. The stdin remains unchanged as no input operations are performed.
