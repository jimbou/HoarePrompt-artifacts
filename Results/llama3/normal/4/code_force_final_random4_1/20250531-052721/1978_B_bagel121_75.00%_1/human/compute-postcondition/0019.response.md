The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `_` is 2, `t` must be greater than 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `n`, `a`, `b` are assigned the values of the next line of input from stdin, stdin contains `t-2` lines of input, each containing three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9)**
