Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, _ is equal to t, t must be greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin is empty. If a is greater than or equal to b, the product of n and a is printed. Otherwise, the sum of ans and p2 is printed.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the loop variable `_` has reached the value of `t`. The input from `stdin` has been fully consumed, and the variables `n`, `a`, and `b` hold the values from the last line of input. The output is either the product of `n` and `a` (if `a` is greater than or equal to `b`) or the sum of `ans` and `p2` (otherwise).
