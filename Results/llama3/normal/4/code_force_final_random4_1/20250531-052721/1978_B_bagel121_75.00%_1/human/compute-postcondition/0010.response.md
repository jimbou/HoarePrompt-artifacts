Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, _ is 0, t must be greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9). If a is greater than or equal to b, the product of n and a is being printed. Otherwise, the sum of ans and p2 is being printed.**
