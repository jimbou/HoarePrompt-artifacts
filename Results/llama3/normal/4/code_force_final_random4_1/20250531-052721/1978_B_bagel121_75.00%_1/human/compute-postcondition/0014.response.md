Output: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `_` is 1, `t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `n`, `a`, `b` are assigned the values of the next line of input from stdin, stdin contains t-3 lines of input, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9), and the product of `n` and `a` is being printed**
