Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4, _ is 2, t must be greater than 2, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9, ans is an integer between 1 and 10^18, p2 is an integer between 0 and 10^18, stdin contains t-3 lines of input, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9), n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9**

In this final state, the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The code introduces three new variables: `k`, `ans`, and `p2`. The value of `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`, which means it can be any integer between 1 and 10^9. The value of `ans` is calculated as the integer part of the average of `b` and `b - k + 1`, multiplied by `k`, which can be any integer between 1 and 10^18. The value of `p2` is the product of `n - k` and `a`, which can be any integer between 0 and 10^18. The stdin remains unchanged, containing `t-3` lines of input, each with three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.
