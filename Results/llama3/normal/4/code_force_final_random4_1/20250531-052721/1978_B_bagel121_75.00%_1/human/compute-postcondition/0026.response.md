Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `_` is 2, `t` must be greater than 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains `t-3` lines of input, each containing three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9). If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the product of `n` and `a` is printed. Otherwise, the value of `ans + p2` is printed.***
