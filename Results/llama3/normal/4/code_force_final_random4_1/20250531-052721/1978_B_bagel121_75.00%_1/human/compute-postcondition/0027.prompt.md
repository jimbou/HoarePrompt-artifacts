Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t lines of input, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if a >= b:
        print(n * a)
    else:
        k = min(b - a + 1, n)
        ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)
        p2 = (n - k) * a
        print(ans + p2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, _ is 0, t must be greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9). If a is greater than or equal to b, the product of n and a is being printed. Otherwise, the sum of ans and p2 is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, _ is 1, t must be greater than 1, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9, n, a, b are assigned the values of the next line of input from stdin, stdin contains t-3 lines of input, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9). If a is greater than or equal to b, the product of n and a is printed. Otherwise, k is an integer equal to the minimum of b - a + 1 and n, ans is an integer equal to the sum of the arithmetic series from b - k + 1 to b, p2 is an integer equal to (n - k) times a, and the sum of ans and p2 is printed, which is the sum of the sum of the arithmetic series from b - k + 1 to b and (n - k) times a.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `_` is 2, `t` must be greater than 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains `t-3` lines of input, each containing three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9). If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the product of `n` and `a` is printed. Otherwise, the value of `ans + p2` is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
