The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the first line of the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains multiple lines of input, and the first line contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4). After executing the code, the first line of the input is consumed, and the remaining lines are still in the stdin.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t lines of input, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9).**
