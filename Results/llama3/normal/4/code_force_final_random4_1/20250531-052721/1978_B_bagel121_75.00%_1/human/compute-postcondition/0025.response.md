The code prints the sum of `ans` and `p2`. Where `ans` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, and `p2` is an integer between 0 and 10^18.
Output: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4, _ is 2, t must be greater than 2, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9, ans is an integer between 1 and 10^18, p2 is an integer between 0 and 10^18, stdin contains t-3 lines of input, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9), n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9, and this is printed: ans + p2**
