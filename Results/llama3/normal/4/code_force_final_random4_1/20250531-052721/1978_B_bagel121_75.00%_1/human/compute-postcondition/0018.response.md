Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, _ is 1, t must be greater than 1, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9, n, a, b are assigned the values of the next line of input from stdin, stdin contains t-3 lines of input, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9). If a is greater than or equal to b, the product of n and a is printed. Otherwise, k is an integer equal to the minimum of b - a + 1 and n, ans is an integer equal to the sum of the arithmetic series from b - k + 1 to b, p2 is an integer equal to (n - k) times a, and the sum of ans and p2 is printed, which is the sum of the sum of the arithmetic series from b - k + 1 to b and (n - k) times a.**
