This function reads a series of input lines from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers n, a, and b, and calculates the sum of the products of n and a, or the sum of the arithmetic series from b to b-k+1 and the product of (n-k) and a, depending on whether a is greater than or equal to b. It then prints the calculated sum for each test case, until all t test cases have been processed, leaving stdin empty.
