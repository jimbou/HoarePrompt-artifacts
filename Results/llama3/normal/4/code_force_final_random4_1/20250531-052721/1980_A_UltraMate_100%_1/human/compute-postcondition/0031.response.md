Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in `s`, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `_` is 1, `i` is 'A', `ans` is `m`, and the current value of `i` is not present in `hmp`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to `m`, which is an integer. The other variables remain unchanged. The current value of `i` is still 'A' and is not present in the Counter object `hmp`. The stdin still contains `t-3` test cases.
