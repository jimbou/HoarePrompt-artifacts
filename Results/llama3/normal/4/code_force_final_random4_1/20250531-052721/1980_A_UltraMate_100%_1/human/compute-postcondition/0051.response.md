The code prints the value of `ans`, which is a calculated value based on the frequency of characters in the string `s` and the given integers `m` and `n`.

The value of `ans` is calculated as follows:

- It starts with the product of `m` and the number of characters in the string 'ABCDEFG' that are not present in the Counter object `hmp`. This means that for each character in 'ABCDEFG' that does not appear in `s`, `m` is added to `ans`.
- Then, for each character in `s` that has a frequency less than `m`, the difference between `m` and the frequency of that character is added to `ans`. This means that if a character appears less than `m` times in `s`, the difference between `m` and its actual frequency is added to `ans`.

Since the exact values of `m`, `n`, `s`, and `hmp` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `ans` based on the given conditions.

Output: **m times the number of characters in 'ABCDEFG' that are not present in hmp, plus the sum of m minus the frequency of each character in s that has a frequency less than m**
