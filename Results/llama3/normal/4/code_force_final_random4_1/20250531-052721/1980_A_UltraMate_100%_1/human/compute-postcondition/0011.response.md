Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in `s`, stdin contains `t-1` test cases, `_` is 0, `i` is 'C', `ans` is increased by `m` if 'C' is not in `hmp`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is increased by `m` if the character 'C' is not present in the string `s`. All other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains `t-1` test cases.
