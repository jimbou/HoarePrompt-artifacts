Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in `s`, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `_` is 2, `i` is 'A', and `ans` is `m`**

The value of `ans` has been updated by adding `m` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-3` test cases. The current value of `i` 'A' is still not present in `hmp`.
