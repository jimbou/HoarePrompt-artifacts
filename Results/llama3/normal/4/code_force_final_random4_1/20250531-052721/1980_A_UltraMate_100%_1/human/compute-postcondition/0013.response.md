Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000, n is an integer, m is an integer, s is a string, p is 'ABCDEFG', hmp is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in s, stdin contains t-1 test cases, _ is 0, i is 'G'. If 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', or 'G' is not in hmp, ans is increased by m for each of these characters.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the variable `ans`. The variable `ans` is increased by `m` for each character in the string `p` that is not present in the Counter object `hmp`. This means that if any of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', or 'G' are not in the string `s`, the value of `ans` will be increased by `m` for each of these characters.
