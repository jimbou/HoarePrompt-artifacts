According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and stdin contains `t` test cases. So for the loop to be executed, `t` must be at least 1 and `_` is 0.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains `t` test cases, `_` is 0**
