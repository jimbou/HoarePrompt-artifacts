Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 2 and 1000, n is an integer, m is an integer, s is a string that must have at least 1 character, p is 'ABCDEFG', hmp is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in s, stdin contains t-3 test cases, _ is 2, i is 'G', ans is the sum of m for each character in 'ABCDEFG' that is not in hmp.
Code of the loop:
for i in hmp:
    if hmp[i] < m:
        ans += m - hmp[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in `s` that must have at least 1 key, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `_` is 2, `i` is a key in `hmp`, `ans` is the sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEFG' that is not in `hmp`. If the frequency of character `i` in `s` is less than `m`, `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in `s` that must have at least 2 keys, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `_` is 2, `i` is another key in `hmp`, `ans` is the sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEFG' that is not in `hmp` plus `m - hmp[i]` if the frequency of character `i` in `s` is less than `m`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in `s` that must have at least 3 keys, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `_` is 2, `i` is another key in `hmp`, `ans` is the sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEFG' that is not in `hmp` plus `m - hmp[i]` if the frequency of character `i` in `s` is less than `m`. If the frequency of character `i` in `s` is less than `m`, `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
