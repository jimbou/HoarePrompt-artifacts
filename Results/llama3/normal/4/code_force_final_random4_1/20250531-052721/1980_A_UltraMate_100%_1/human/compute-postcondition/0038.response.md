Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in `s`, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `_` is 1. If 'C' is not present in `hmp`, then `ans` is `m` if 'A' is not present in `hmp` or 'B' is not present in `hmp`, otherwise `ans` is `m+m`.***
