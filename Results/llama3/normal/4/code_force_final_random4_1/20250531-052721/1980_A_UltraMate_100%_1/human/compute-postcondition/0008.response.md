Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in `s`, `ans` is increased by `m`, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `_` is 0, `i` is 'B'**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding `m` to it. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains t-1 test cases, and the Counter object `hmp` still contains the frequency of each character in the string `s`.
