Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in `s` that must have at least 1 element, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `_` is 1, `i` is another character in `s`, `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`**.

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is increased by the difference between `m` and the frequency of character `i` in string `s`. All other variables remain unchanged.
