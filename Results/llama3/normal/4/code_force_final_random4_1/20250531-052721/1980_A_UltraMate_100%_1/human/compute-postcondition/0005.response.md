Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string, `ans` is `m`, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in `s`, stdin contains `t-1` test cases, `_` is 0, `i` is 'A', and the current value of `i` is not present in `hmp`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to `m`, which means it now holds the value of `m`. All other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions specified in the initial state still hold true. The value of `ans` is now equal to `m`, and all other variables retain their original values and properties.
