Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 1000, n is an integer, m is an integer, s is a string that must have at least 1 character, p is 'ABCDEFG', hmp is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in s, stdin contains t-3 test cases, _ is 2, i is 'G', ans is the sum of m for each character in 'ABCDEFG' that is not in hmp.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `ans` will be the sum of `m` for each character in the string `'ABCDEFG'` that is not present in the string `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.
