Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in `s`, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `_` is 1, `ans` is `m` if 'A' is not present in `hmp`, otherwise `ans` is `m`, `i` is 'B'**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be `m` if 'A' is not present in `hmp`, otherwise it is still `m`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-3` test cases.
