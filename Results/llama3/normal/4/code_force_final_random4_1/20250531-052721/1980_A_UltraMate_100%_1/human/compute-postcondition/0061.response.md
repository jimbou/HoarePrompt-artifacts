Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `p` is `'ABCDEFG'`, `hmp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in `s`, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `_` is 2. If `i` is not in `hmp`, `ans` is either `m` or `m+m` depending on whether `'A'` is in `hmp`.***
