Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 1000, n is an integer, m is an integer, s is a string, p is 'ABCDEFG', hmp is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in s, stdin contains t-1 test cases, _ is 0, i is 'G'. If 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', or 'G' is not in hmp, ans is increased by m for each of these characters.
Code of the loop:
for i in hmp:
    if hmp[i] < m:
        ans += m - hmp[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object containing at least one key-value pair, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `_` is 0, `i` is a key in `hmp`. If the current value of `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object containing at least two key-value pairs, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `_` is 0, `i` is a key in `hmp` that has been iterated over. If the value of `i` in `hmp` is less than `m`, `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object containing at least one key-value pair, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `_` is 0, `i` is a key in `hmp` that has been iterated over. If the value of `i` in `hmp` is less than `m`, then `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
