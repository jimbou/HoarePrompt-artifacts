Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000, n is an integer, m is an integer, s is a string, p is 'ABCDEFG', hmp is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in s, stdin contains t-3 test cases, _ is 1, i is the last key in hmp, ans is 0**

The code block executes as follows:

1. `n, m = map(int, input().split())`: This line reads two integers from the standard input and assigns them to `n` and `m`, respectively. Since `stdin` initially contains `t-2` test cases, after this line, `stdin` will contain `t-3` test cases.

2. `s = input()`: This line reads a string from the standard input and assigns it to `s`.

3. `ans = 0`: This line resets the value of `ans` to 0.

4. `p = 'ABCDEFG'`: This line assigns the string 'ABCDEFG' to `p`.

5. `hmp = Counter(s)`: This line creates a Counter object `hmp` containing the frequency of each character in the string `s`.

The final state is a combination of the initial state and the changes made by the code block. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `p`, and `hmp` are updated, and `ans` is reset to 0. The value of `i` is not explicitly updated in the code, but since `hmp` is recreated, `i` will now refer to the last key in the new `hmp` object. The value of `_` remains unchanged.
