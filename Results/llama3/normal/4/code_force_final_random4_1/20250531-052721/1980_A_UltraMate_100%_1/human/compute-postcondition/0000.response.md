The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5) followed by a string `a` of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G'. The first integer `t` is assigned to `t`. The remaining test cases are still in the stdin.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5) followed by a string `a` of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G'.**
