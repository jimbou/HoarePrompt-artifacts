Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `p` is `'ABCDEFG'`, `hmp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in `s`, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `_` is 2, `i` is `'B'`, `ans` is increased by `m`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been increased by the value of `m`, while all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `t` is still between 2 and 1000, `n` and `m` are still integers, `s` is still a string with at least one character, `p` is still `'ABCDEFG'`, `hmp` still contains the frequency of each character in `s`, there are still `t-3` test cases in `stdin`, `_` is still 2, and `i` is still `'B'`.
