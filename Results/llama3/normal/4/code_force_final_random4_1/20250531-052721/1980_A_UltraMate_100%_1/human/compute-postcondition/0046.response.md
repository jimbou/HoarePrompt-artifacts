Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in `s` that must have at least 2 elements, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `_` is 1, `i` is another character in `s`. If the frequency of character `i` in `s` is less than `m`, `ans` is `m` times the number of characters in 'ABCDEFG' that are not present in `hmp`, plus `m` minus the frequency of character `i` in `s`, plus `m` minus the frequency of character `i` in `s`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
