Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object containing at least two key-value pairs, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `_` is 0, `i` is a key in `hmp` that has been iterated over, `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding the difference between `m` and the value of `hmp[i]`, where `i` is a key in the Counter object `hmp`. The value of `i` has been iterated over, so it is no longer a key that has not been iterated over yet. The other variables remain unchanged.
