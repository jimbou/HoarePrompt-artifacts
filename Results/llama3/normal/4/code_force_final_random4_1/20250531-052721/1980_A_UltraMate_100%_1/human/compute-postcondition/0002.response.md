Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000, n is an integer, m is an integer, s is a string, ans is 0, p is 'ABCDEFG', hmp is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in s, stdin contains t-1 test cases, _ is 0**

Explanation:

* The first line reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to `n` and `m`, respectively. This reduces the number of test cases in stdin by 1.
* The second line reads a string from stdin and assigns it to `s`.
* The third line initializes `ans` to 0.
* The fourth line assigns the string 'ABCDEFG' to `p`.
* The fifth line creates a Counter object `hmp` containing the frequency of each character in `s`.

Note that the value of `t` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The value of `_` also remains 0, as it is not modified by the code. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 1, as one test case is read and processed by the code.
