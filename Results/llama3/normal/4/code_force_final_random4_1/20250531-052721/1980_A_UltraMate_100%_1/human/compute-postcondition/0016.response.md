Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object containing at least one key-value pair, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `_` is 0, `i` is a key in `hmp` and the current value of `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is increased by the difference between `m` and the current value of `hmp[i]`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `p`, `hmp`, `stdin`, and `_` remain unchanged. The key `i` in `hmp` still has a value less than `m`.
