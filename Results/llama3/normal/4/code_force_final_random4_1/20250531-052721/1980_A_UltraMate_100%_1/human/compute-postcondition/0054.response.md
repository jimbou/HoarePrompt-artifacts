Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 1000, n is an integer, m is an integer, s is a string that must have at least 1 character, p is 'ABCDEFG', hmp is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in s, stdin contains t-3 test cases, _ is 2, i is the last character in s that was processed by the loop, and ans is 0.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_`, and `i` remain unchanged because they are not modified by the code. The value of `n` and `m` are updated to the integer values from the input. The value of `s` is updated to the string from the input. The value of `p` remains the same as it was not modified by the code. The value of `hmp` is updated to a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in `s`. The value of `ans` is reset to 0. The number of test cases in `stdin` is reduced by 2 because two inputs were read.
