This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers (n and m) and a string (s) of n characters. It calculates the total number of characters needed to make the frequency of each character in the string 's' at least 'm', considering the characters 'A' to 'G'. The function then prints the calculated total for each test case.
