Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5) followed by a string `a` of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G'.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    ans = 0
    p = 'ABCDEFG'
    hmp = Counter(s)
    for i in p:
        if i not in hmp:
            ans += m
    for i in hmp:
        if hmp[i] < m:
            ans += m - hmp[i]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 1 and 1000, n is an integer, m is an integer, s is a string, p is 'ABCDEFG', hmp is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in s, stdin contains t-1 test cases, _ is 0, i is the last key in hmp, ans is increased by m - hmp[i] for each key i in hmp where hmp[i] is less than m, and the value of ans which is the sum of m - hmp[i] for each key i in hmp where hmp[i] is less than m is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in `s`, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `_` is 1, `i` is the last character in `s` that was processed by the loop, and `ans` is `m` times the number of characters in 'ABCDEFG' that are not present in `hmp`, plus the sum of `m` minus the frequency of each character in `s` that has a frequency less than `m`, and the value of `ans` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 2 and 1000, n is an integer, m is an integer, s is a string that must have at least 1 character, p is 'ABCDEFG', hmp is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in s, stdin contains t-3 test cases, _ is 2, i is the last key in hmp, ans is the sum of m for each character in 'ABCDEFG' that is not in hmp plus m - hmp[i] for each character i in hmp where the frequency of character i in s is less than m, and ans is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
