To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the `hmp` Counter object. The loop will execute if `hmp` is not empty. Since `hmp` contains the frequency of each character in string `s`, for the loop to execute, `s` must have at least one character. Also, since `i` will take the value of each character in `hmp`, `i` must be one of the characters in `s`.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in `s` that must not be empty, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `_` is 1, `i` is one of the characters in `s`, `ans` is `m` times the number of characters in 'ABCDEFG' that are not present in `hmp`**
