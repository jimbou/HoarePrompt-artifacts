Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in `s`, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `_` is 1, `ans` is `m` if 'A' is not present in `hmp` or 'B' is not present in `hmp`, otherwise `ans` is `m+m`, `i` is 'C'**

The value of `ans` is increased by `m`. The previous value of `ans` was `m` if 'A' is not present in `hmp` or 'B' is not present in `hmp`, otherwise `ans` was `m`. Therefore, the new value of `ans` is `m` if 'A' is not present in `hmp` or 'B' is not present in `hmp`, otherwise `ans` is `m+m`. The states of the other variables are not affected.
