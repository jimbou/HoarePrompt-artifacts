Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object containing at least two key-value pairs, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `_` is 0, `i` is a key in `hmp` that has been iterated over. If the value of `i` in `hmp` is less than `m`, `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`.***
