The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and p, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `p`. If p is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, p is 'ABCDEFG' which ensures that the loop will execute, so it does not need to be adjusted. i is not initialized before the loop, so it needs to be adjusted to the first character in p which is 'A'. 
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000, n is an integer, m is an integer, s is a string, ans is 0, p is 'ABCDEFG', hmp is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in s, stdin contains t-1 test cases, _ is 0, i is 'A'**
