The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and p, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `p`. If `i` is less than `p`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 'A', `p` is 'ABCDEFG'. For the loop to execute again `i` is 'B' and for the loop to execute again p must be 'ABCDEFG'.
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000, n is an integer, m is an integer, s is a string, p is 'ABCDEFG', hmp is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in s, stdin contains t-1 test cases, _ is 0, i is 'B'**
