To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the Counter object `hmp`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `hmp`. If `hmp` has at least 1 key (i.e., a character in the string `s`), the loop will execute.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in `s` that must have at least 1 key, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `_` is 2, `i` is a key in `hmp`, `ans` is the sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEFG' that is not in `hmp`**
