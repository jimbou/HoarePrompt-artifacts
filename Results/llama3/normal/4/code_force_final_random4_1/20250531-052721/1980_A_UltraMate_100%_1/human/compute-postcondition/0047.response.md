To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for i in hmp:`.

Since `hmp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in `s` and must have at least 2 elements, we know that `hmp` has at least one more element to iterate over. Therefore, we can adjust the state of `i` to be the next character in `hmp`.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in `s` that must have at least 1 element, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `_` is 1, `i` is another character in `s`**
