The code `ans += m - hmp[i]` updates the value of `ans` by adding the difference between `m` and the frequency of character `i` in `s`, which is stored in `hmp[i]`. Since the frequency of character `i` in `s` is less than `m`, the value of `ans` increases by a positive amount.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in `s` that must not be empty, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `_` is 1, `i` is one of the characters in `s`, and `ans` is `m` times the number of characters in 'ABCDEFG' that are not present in `hmp`, plus `m` minus the frequency of character `i` in `s`.**
