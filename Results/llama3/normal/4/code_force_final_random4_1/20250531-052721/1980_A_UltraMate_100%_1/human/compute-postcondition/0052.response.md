Output: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in `s`, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `_` is 1, `i` is the last character in `s` that was processed by the loop, and `ans` is `m` times the number of characters in 'ABCDEFG' that are not present in `hmp`, plus the sum of `m` minus the frequency of each character in `s` that has a frequency less than `m`, and the value of `ans` is being printed**
