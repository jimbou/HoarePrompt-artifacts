Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the mathematical formula for calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions. The formula is based on the concept of greatest common divisor (GCD) and the properties of multiples.

The program uses a while loop to iterate over all possible values of i, where i is the GCD of a and b. For each value of i, it calculates the number of pairs (a, b) that satisfy the conditions and adds it to the total count.

The program correctly handles the edge cases where n or m is 1, and it also correctly handles the case where n and m are both large numbers.

The program's time complexity is O(sqrt(m)), which is efficient for the given constraints. The program's space complexity is O(1), which is also efficient.

Overall, the program is correct and efficient, and it correctly solves the problem for all possible inputs.
