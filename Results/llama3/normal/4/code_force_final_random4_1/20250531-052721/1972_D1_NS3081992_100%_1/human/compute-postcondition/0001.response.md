Output State: **`func_10()` returns a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `func_15()` returns a value that can be converted to a string, the output of `func_15()` is printed to the console followed by a newline character.**

In this output state, the values of `func_10()` and `_` remain unchanged. The value returned by `func_15()` is converted to a string and printed to the console, followed by a newline character. This means that the output of `func_15()` is now visible on the console, but the internal state of the program remains the same.
