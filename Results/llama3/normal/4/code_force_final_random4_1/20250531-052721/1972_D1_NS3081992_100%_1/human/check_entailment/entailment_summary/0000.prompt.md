Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

''' 

 Output hints for function3:  Reads two space-separated integers from the standard input and returns them as a list of two integers.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(rows_number):
    return [func_3() for _ in range(rows_number)]
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function generates a list by repeating the result of func_3() a specified number of times, as determined by the input rows_number, and returns this list.
Function number 5 :
 Code:

def func_5():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip()
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  Reads a line from the standard input, removes trailing newlines and whitespace, and returns the processed string.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip().decode()
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  Reads a line from standard input, removes trailing newlines, and decodes the input from bytes to a string, returning the resulting string.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7():
    return [int(i) for i in input().split()]
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function accepts a string of two space-separated positive integers as input, parses it, and returns a list of two positive integers.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(rows):
    return [func_7() for _ in range(rows)]
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function generates a list by repeating the result of func_7() a specified number of times, as determined by the input 'rows', and returns this list.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9():
    return input()
''' 

 Output hints for function9:  The function accepts no parameters and returns a string that represents a line of text, possibly containing multiple values separated by spaces, which is expected to be processed further to extract relevant information. The function does not perform any processing or modification on the input, but rather simply returns the input as is.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function10:  The function reads a positive integer from standard input and returns it as is, without any modifications or additional processing.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11():
    return input().split()
''' 

 Output hints for function11:  Reads a single line of input from standard input, splits it into two strings using space as a separator, and returns the resulting list of two strings, where each string represents a positive integer.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(d, processing, da, rank):
    tmp = 10 ** 9
    if len(d[da]) == 1:

            processing[di - 1] = 0
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
''' 

 Output hints for function12:  This function calculates and returns the minimum rank of a given key 'da' in a dictionary 'd' based on the values associated with 'da' and their processing status. If the list associated with 'da' has only one element, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it iterates through the list, updates the processing status, and recursively calls another function 'func_12' to calculate the minimum rank. The function returns the minimum rank plus one, which is stored in the 'rank' list.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        x = 1
        y = 0
        return (x, y, a)
    (x, y, g) = func_13(b, a % b)
    return (y, x - a // b * y, g)
''' 

 Output hints for function13:  This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two non-negative integers a and b, and returns the GCD along with the coefficients x and y such that ax + by = gcd(a, b). If b is 0, the function returns (1, 0, a). Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with b and a % b, and returns the calculated values.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14(a, n, m, k):

        if a[i] < m:

    if k >= 0:
        return 1
    return -1
''' 

 Output hints for function14:  This function evaluates a list of integers against a given threshold value. It iterates through the list, subtracting the difference between the threshold and each element from a counter if the element is less than the threshold. If the counter remains non-negative after this process, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1. The function effectively checks if the cumulative difference between the threshold and all elements below it in the list does not exceed the initial counter value.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
''' 

 Output hints for function15:  Functionality: This function calculates the sum of the integer divisions of (n + j) by (j * j) for all j from 1 to i - 1, where i is the smallest integer greater than or equal to 2 such that i * i > n + i, and then subtracts 1 from the result. It takes two positive integers n and m as input, where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, and returns the calculated value.
Function number 16 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
