The only variables in the loop head are variables `_` and `func_10()`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `_` and `func_10()`. If `_` is less than `func_10()`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `func_10()` is a positive integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `func_10()` must be greater than 2.
State: **`func_10()` returns a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, the output of `func_15()` is printed to the console followed by a newline character, and the output of `func_15()` is printed to the console followed by a newline character.**
