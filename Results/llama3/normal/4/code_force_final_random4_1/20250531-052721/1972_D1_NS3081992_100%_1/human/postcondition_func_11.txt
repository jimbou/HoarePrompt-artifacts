This function calculates and returns the minimum rank of a given key 'da' in a dictionary 'd' based on the values associated with 'da' and their processing status. If the list associated with 'da' has only one element, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it iterates through the list, updates the processing status, and recursively calls another function 'func_12' to calculate the minimum rank. The function returns the minimum rank plus one, which is stored in the 'rank' list.
