Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers, `n` is the length of list `a`, `m` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n-1`. If any element of `a` is less than `m`, then `k` is decreased by the sum of the positive values `m - a[i]` for all `i` where `a[i]` is less than `m`. The current value of `k` is greater than or equal to 0.**
