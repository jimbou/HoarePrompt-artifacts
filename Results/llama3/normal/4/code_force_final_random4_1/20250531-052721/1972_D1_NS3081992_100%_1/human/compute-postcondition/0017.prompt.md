You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a dictionary where each key is an integer and each value is a list of integers, processing is a list of integers of the same length as the number of keys in d, da is an integer key in d, and rank is a list of integers of the same length as the number of keys in d.
    tmp = 10 ** 9
    if (len(d[da]) == 1) :
        return 1
        #The program returns the integer 1.
    #State: *`d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer and each value is a list of integers, `processing` is a list of integers of the same length as the number of keys in `d`, `da` is an integer key in `d`, `rank` is a list of integers of the same length as the number of keys in `d`, and `tmp` is 1000000000. The length of the list associated with the key `da` in `d` is more than 1.
    for di in d[da]:
        if processing[di - 1] == 0:
            processing[di - 1] = 1
            tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
            processing[di - 1] = 0
        
    #State: d is a dictionary where each key is an integer and each value is a list of integers, processing is a list of integers of the same length as the number of keys in d, da is an integer key in d, rank is a list of integers of the same length as the number of keys in d, tmp is an integer less than or equal to 1000000000, and the list associated with the key da in d has been fully traversed, di is the last element in the list associated with the key da in d. If processing[di - 1] is 0, then tmp is updated to be the minimum of its original value and the result of func_12(d, processing, di, rank).
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
    #The program returns an integer value that is one more than tmp, where tmp is an integer less than or equal to 1000000000.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the integer 1.

Case_2: The program returns an integer value that is one more than tmp, where tmp is an integer less than or equal to 1000000000.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
