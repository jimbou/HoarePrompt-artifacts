    return map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains two integers that were read from the input string, which are space-separated.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads a string containing two space-separated integers from standard input, converts them to integers, and returns a map object containing the two integers.

    #The program returns a string representing a line from the standard input, with trailing newlines and other trailing whitespace removed.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads a line from the standard input, removes trailing newlines and whitespace, and returns the processed string.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No precondition can be determined from this function alone as it only reads a line from standard input and does not use any variables from the problem description.

    return [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    #The program returns a list of two positive integers that were input as a string of two space-separated positive integers.

    #The program returns a list containing the results of func_7() repeated 'rows' times, where 'rows' is a positive integer.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function generates a list by repeating the result of func_7() a specified number of times, as determined by the input 'rows', and returns this list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is a string that represents a line of text, possibly containing multiple values separated by spaces, and is expected to be processed further to extract relevant information.
    return input()
    #The program returns a string that represents a line of text, possibly containing multiple values separated by spaces, which is expected to be processed further to extract relevant information.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns a string that represents a line of text, possibly containing multiple values separated by spaces, which is expected to be processed further to extract relevant information. The function does not perform any processing or modification on the input, but rather simply returns the input as is.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains one input: a positive integer.
    return int(input())
    #The program returns a positive integer that was provided as input from stdin.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a positive integer from standard input and returns it as is, without any modifications or additional processing.

    return tmp + 1
    #The program returns an integer value that is one more than tmp, where tmp is an integer less than or equal to 1000000000.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the minimum rank of a given key 'da' in a dictionary 'd' based on the values associated with 'da' and their processing status. If the list associated with 'da' has only one element, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it iterates through the list, updates the processing status, and recursively calls another function 'func_12' to calculate the minimum rank. The function returns the minimum rank plus one, which is stored in the 'rank' list.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two non-negative integers a and b, and returns the GCD along with the coefficients x and y such that ax + by = gcd(a, b). If b is 0, the function returns (1, 0, a). Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with b and a % b, and returns the calculated values.

    return -1
    #The program returns -1, which is a negative integer.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function evaluates a list of integers against a given threshold value. It iterates through the list, subtracting the difference between the threshold and each element from a counter if the element is less than the threshold. If the counter remains non-negative after this process, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1. The function effectively checks if the cumulative difference between the threshold and all elements below it in the list does not exceed the initial counter value.

#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: This function calculates the sum of the integer divisions of (n + j) by (j * j) for all j from 1 to i - 1, where i is the smallest integer greater than or equal to 2 such that i * i > n + i, and then subtracts 1 from the result. It takes two positive integers n and m as input, where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, and returns the calculated value.
