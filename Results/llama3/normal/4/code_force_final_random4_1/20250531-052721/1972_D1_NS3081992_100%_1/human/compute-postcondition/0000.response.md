The only variables in the loop head are the variable `_` and the function `func_10()`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value returned by `func_10()`. If `func_10()` returns a positive integer, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `func_10()` returns a positive integer does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `func_10()` returns a positive integer greater than 0 and `_` is now 0.

State: **`func_10()` returns a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `func_15()` returns a value that can be converted to a string**
