This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two non-negative integers a and b, and returns the GCD along with the coefficients x and y such that ax + by = gcd(a, b). If b is 0, the function returns (1, 0, a). Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with b and a % b, and returns the calculated values.
