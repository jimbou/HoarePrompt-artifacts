The code `sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')` writes the output of `func_15()` to the console followed by a newline character. Since the output of `func_15()` is already printed to the console followed by a newline character, this code will print the same output again followed by another newline character.

Output State: **The output of `func_15()` is printed to the console twice, each followed by a newline character, `func_10()` returns a positive integer greater than 2, and `_` is 2.**
