The only variables in the loop head are variables `_` and `func_10()`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value returned by `func_10()`. If the value returned by `func_10()` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `func_10()` returns a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time the value returned by `func_10()` must be greater than 1 and `_` is 1.
State: **`func_10()` returns a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `func_15()` returns a value that can be converted to a string, the output of `func_15()` is printed to the console followed by a newline character.**
