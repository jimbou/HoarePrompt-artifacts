Functionality: This function calculates the sum of the integer divisions of (n + j) by (j * j) for all j from 1 to i - 1, where i is the smallest integer greater than or equal to 2 such that i * i > n + i, and then subtracts 1 from the result. It takes two positive integers n and m as input, where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, and returns the calculated value.
