Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).

Function 15 (`func_15`) is the core function that calculates the desired value. It takes two positive integers n and m as input and returns the calculated value.

Function 15 uses a while loop to iterate from 1 to m (inclusive) and checks if i * i is less than or equal to n + i. For each iteration, it adds the integer division of (n + i) by (i * i) to the answer.

Function 16 (`func_16`) is the main function that reads the number of test cases from standard input and calls Function 15 for each test case, printing the result to the console.

The execution summaries of the functions suggest that they are working as intended. Function 15 correctly calculates the desired value, and Function 16 correctly reads the input and prints the output.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of the functions, the given program is correct.
