Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, d is an integer, a is less than or equal to c, x is an integer equal to half of the absolute difference between a and c, l is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to b - x, r is an integer less than or equal to w and greater than or equal to b + x, stdin is empty, and the absolute difference between a and c is even.**

The code block modifies the values of `l` and `r`. The first line assigns the maximum value between 1 and `b - x` to `l`, making `l` greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `b - x`. The second line assigns the minimum value between `w` and `b + x` to `r`, making `r` less than or equal to `w` and greater than or equal to `b + x`. No other variables are affected.
