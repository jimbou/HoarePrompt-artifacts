Precondition: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains six integers: h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b. h and w are positive integers representing the dimensions of the board. x_a, y_a, x_b, and y_b are positive integers representing the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips on the board, such that 1 <= x_a, x_b <= h and 1 <= y_a, y_b <= w. Additionally, x_a != x_b or y_a != y_b.**
