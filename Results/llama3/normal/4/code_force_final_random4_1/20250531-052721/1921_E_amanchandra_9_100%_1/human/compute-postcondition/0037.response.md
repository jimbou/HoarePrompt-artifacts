To determine what will be printed, let's break down the expression inside the `print` statement step by step, based on the given initial state.

The expression is:
```python
*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1]
```
This expression involves several variables and conditions. Let's analyze them one by one:

1. `l` is the maximum value between 1 and `d - x`. Since `x` is a non-negative integer, `l` will be at least 1, and at most `d - x`.

2. `r` is the minimum value between `w` and `d + x`. This means `r` will be either `w` or `d + x`, whichever is smaller.

3. `abs(l - b)` and `abs(r - b)` are absolute differences between `l` and `b`, and `r` and `b`, respectively. These are used in the condition to check if both differences are less than or equal to `x + 1`.

4. The condition `abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1` checks if both `l` and `r` are within `x + 1` units of `b`. If this condition is true, it means that `b` is close enough to both `l` and `r`.

5. The expression `*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])` is a tuple of two lists. The `*` operator unpacks this tuple into a list of lists. However, the indexing `[abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1]` will select one of these lists based on the condition.

   - If the condition is true, the index will be `True`, which is equivalent to `1` in a boolean context. This will select the second list, `['Alice']`.
   - If the condition is false, the index will be `False`, which is equivalent to `0` in a boolean context. This will select the first list, `['Draw']`.

Given the initial state, we can't determine the exact values of `l`, `r`, `b`, and `x`, as they depend on the values of `w`, `d`, and `x`, which are not specified. However, we can describe the output based on the condition:

- If `b` is close enough to both `l` and `r` (i.e., within `x + 1` units), the output will be `['Alice']`.
- Otherwise, the output will be `['Draw']`.

Output: **['Alice'] if b is close enough to both l and r, otherwise ['Draw']**
