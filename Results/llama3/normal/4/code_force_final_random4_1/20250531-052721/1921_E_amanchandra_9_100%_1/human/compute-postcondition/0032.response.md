Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers, stdin contains a space-separated list of 5 integers**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged. The variables `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are assigned the values of the 6 integers from the input, where `input().split()` accepts a space-separated list of integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The stdin now contains a space-separated list of 5 integers.
