The code accepts a space-separated list of integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. Since stdin is empty in the initial state, it will remain empty after the code execution. The values of `t` and `_` are not affected by the code.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers, stdin is empty**
