To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t` and the loop variable `_` (although `_` is a throwaway variable and doesn't directly affect the loop's execution, its value is still determined by the range of `t`).

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, we can adjust its state to ensure it's greater than 0.

The loop variable `_` will take on values from 0 to `t-1` during the loop's execution. Since we're only concerned with the state before the first execution of the loop, we can set `_` to 0.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0**
