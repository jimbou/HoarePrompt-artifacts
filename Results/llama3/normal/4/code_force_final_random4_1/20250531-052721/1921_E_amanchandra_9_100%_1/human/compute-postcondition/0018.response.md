To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variables involved in the loop head are `_` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 0, and `t` is a positive integer greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, so `_` becomes 1. The value of `t` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

The other variables `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `stdin` are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers, stdin is empty.**
