Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged. The variables `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are assigned integer values from the input, which is a space-separated list of integers. Since the input is consumed, the stdin is now empty.
