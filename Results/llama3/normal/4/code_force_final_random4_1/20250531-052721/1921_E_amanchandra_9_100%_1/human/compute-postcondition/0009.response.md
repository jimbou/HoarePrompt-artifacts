Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, d is an integer, a is less than or equal to c, x is an integer equal to half of the absolute difference between a and c, r is an integer equal to the minimum of w and d + x, l is an integer equal to the maximum of 1 and d - x, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_`, `d`, `a`, `c`, and `x` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `r` is updated to be the minimum of `w` and `d + x`, and the value of `l` is updated to be the maximum of 1 and `d - x`. The stdin remains empty as it was initially.
