Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `r`, `w`, `d` are integers, `a` is less than or equal to `c`, `x` is an integer equal to half of the absolute difference between `a` and `c`, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `x` is calculated as half of the absolute difference between `a` and `c`. Since `a` is less than or equal to `c`, the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is equal to `c - a`. Therefore, `x` is equal to `(c - a) // 2`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
