Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers, stdin contains a space-separated list of 5 integers. If `a` > `c`, then 'Draw' is printed. Otherwise, if the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is odd, then `r` is the minimum value between `w` and `d` + `x`, and `l` is the maximum value between 1 and `d` - `x`, and either 'Draw' or 'Alice' is printed depending on whether the absolute difference between `l` and `b` is less than or equal to `x` + 1 and the absolute difference between `r` and `b` is less than or equal to `x` + 1. If the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is even, then `r` is the minimum value between `w` and `b` + `x`, and `l` is the maximum value between 1 and `b` - `x`, and either 'Draw' or 'Bob' is printed depending on whether the absolute difference between `l` and `d` is less than or equal to `x` and the absolute difference between `r` and `d` is less than or equal to `x`.***
