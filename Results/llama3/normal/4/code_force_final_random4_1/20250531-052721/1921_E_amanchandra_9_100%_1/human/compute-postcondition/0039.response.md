The code snippet consists of two lines that assign values to variables `l` and `r`, respectively. The first line assigns the maximum value between 1 and `b - x` to `l`. Since `b` and `x` are integers, the value of `l` will be an integer. The second line assigns the minimum value between `w` and `b + x` to `r`. Since `w` and `b + x` are integers, the value of `r` will be an integer.

The initial state provides information about the values of `t`, `_`, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `x`. The code snippet only modifies the values of `l` and `r`. The values of `t`, `_`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 2, _ is 2, r is an integer equal to the minimum of w and b + x, w is an integer, a is an integer, b is an integer, c is an integer, d is an integer, x is a non-negative integer, l is an integer equal to the maximum of 1 and b - x**
