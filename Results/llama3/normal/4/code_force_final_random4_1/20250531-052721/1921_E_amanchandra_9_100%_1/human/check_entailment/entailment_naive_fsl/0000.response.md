Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine the outcome of the game in all cases. 

One case where the program does not work correctly is when the difference between Alice's and Bob's row numbers is odd, and the difference between their column numbers is also odd. In this case, the program incorrectly calculates the range of columns that Bob can reach, and may incorrectly conclude that Alice wins when in fact the game is a draw.

For example, consider the input `10 10 2 3 9 8`. The program will output "Alice", but the correct output is "Draw".
