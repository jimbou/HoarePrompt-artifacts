Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `r`, `w`, `b`, `d` are integers, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` and `c` are integers**.

In this output state, the value of `x` is calculated as the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2, which results in a non-negative integer. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
