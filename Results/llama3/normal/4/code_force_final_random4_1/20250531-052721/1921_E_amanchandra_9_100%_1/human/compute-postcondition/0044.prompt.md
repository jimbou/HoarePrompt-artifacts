Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains six integers: h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b. h and w are positive integers representing the dimensions of the board. x_a, y_a, x_b, and y_b are positive integers representing the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips on the board, such that 1 <= x_a, x_b <= h and 1 <= y_a, y_b <= w. Additionally, x_a != x_b or y_a != y_b.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    r, w, a, b, c, d = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if a > c:
        print('Draw')
    else:
        x = abs(a - c) // 2
        if abs(a - c) % 2:
            l = max(1, d - x)
            r = min(w, d + x)
            print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <=
                x + 1])
        else:
            l = max(1, b - x)
            r = min(w, b + x)
            print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers, stdin is empty. If `a` is greater than `c`, 'Draw' is printed. If `a` is less than or equal to `c`, either 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob' is printed depending on the absolute difference between `a` and `c`, and the values of `r`, `w`, `d`, `x`, `l`, and `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers, stdin is empty. If `a` is greater than `c`, then 'Draw' is printed. Otherwise, if the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is odd, then `r` is the minimum of `w` and `d + x`, and either 'Draw' or 'Alice' is printed depending on whether the absolute difference between the maximum of 1 and `d - x` and `b` is less than or equal to `x + 1` and the absolute difference between `r` and `b` is less than or equal to `x + 1`. If the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is even, then `r` is the minimum of `w` and `b + x`, and either 'Draw' or 'Bob' is printed depending on whether the absolute difference between the maximum of 1 and `b - x` and `d` is less than or equal to `x` and the absolute difference between `r` and `d` is less than or equal to `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers, stdin contains a space-separated list of 5 integers. If `a` > `c`, then 'Draw' is printed. Otherwise, if the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is odd, then `r` is the minimum value between `w` and `d` + `x`, and `l` is the maximum value between 1 and `d` - `x`, and either 'Draw' or 'Alice' is printed depending on whether the absolute difference between `l` and `b` is less than or equal to `x` + 1 and the absolute difference between `r` and `b` is less than or equal to `x` + 1. If the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is even, then `r` is the minimum value between `w` and `b` + `x`, and `l` is the maximum value between 1 and `b` - `x`, and either 'Draw' or 'Bob' is printed depending on whether the absolute difference between `l` and `d` is less than or equal to `x` and the absolute difference between `r` and `d` is less than or equal to `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
