The `print` statement uses the ternary operator to select between two lists: `['Draw']` and `['Alice']`. The selection is based on the condition `abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1`.

Here's a breakdown of the variables involved:

* `l` is the maximum of 1 and `d - x`. Since `d` is an integer and `x` is a non-negative integer, `l` will be at least 1.
* `b` is an integer.
* `r` is the minimum of `w` and `d + x`. Since `w` is an integer and `d` and `x` are integers, `r` will be an integer.
* `x` is a non-negative integer.

The condition `abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1` checks whether the absolute differences between `l` and `b` and between `r` and `b` are both less than or equal to `x + 1`.

If the condition is true, the `print` statement will output `['Draw']`. Otherwise, it will output `['Alice']`.

Since the exact values of `l`, `b`, `r`, and `x` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact output. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output either `['Draw']` or `['Alice']`.

Output: **['Draw'] or ['Alice'] (depending on the values of l, b, r, and x)**
