Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `r`, `w`, `b`, `d` are integers, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` and `c` are integers. If the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is odd, then `r` is the minimum of `w` and `d + x`, and either 'Draw' or 'Alice' is printed depending on whether the absolute difference between the maximum of 1 and `d - x` and `b` is less than or equal to `x + 1` and the absolute difference between `r` and `b` is less than or equal to `x + 1`. If the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is even, then `r` is the minimum of `w` and `b + x`, and either 'Draw' or 'Bob' is printed depending on whether the absolute difference between the maximum of 1 and `b - x` and `d` is less than or equal to `x` and the absolute difference between `r` and `d` is less than or equal to `x`.***
