Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers, `x` is a non-negative integer, stdin contains a space-separated list of 5 integers**

The value of `x` is assigned the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2. The absolute difference between `a` and `c` is a non-negative integer, and dividing it by 2 results in a non-negative integer. The values of the other variables are not affected.
