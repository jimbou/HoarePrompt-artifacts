Output State: **`_` is `t`, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers, stdin is empty. If `a` is greater than `c`, 'Draw' is printed. If `a` is less than or equal to `c`, either 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob' is printed depending on the absolute difference between `a` and `c`, and the values of `r`, `w`, `d`, `x`, `l`, and `b`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop counter `_` has reached the value of `t`, indicating that the loop has executed `t` times. The variables `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers, and the standard input `stdin` is empty, indicating that all input test cases have been processed. The output of the loop depends on the values of `a` and `c`, and can be either 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob', depending on the conditions specified in the loop body.
