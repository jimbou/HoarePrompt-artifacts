Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `r`, `w`, `d` are integers, `a` is less than or equal to `c`, `x` is an integer equal to half of the absolute difference between `a` and `c`, stdin is empty. If the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is odd, `r` is an integer equal to the minimum of `w` and `d + x`, `l` is an integer equal to the maximum of 1 and `d - x`, and either 'Draw' or 'Alice' is printed depending on whether the absolute difference between `l` and `b` is less than or equal to `x + 1` and the absolute difference between `r` and `b` is less than or equal to `x + 1`. If the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is even, `l` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `b - x`, `r` is an integer less than or equal to `w` and greater than or equal to `b + x`, and either 'Draw' or 'Bob' is printed depending on whether the absolute difference between `l` and `d` is less than or equal to `x` and the absolute difference between `r` and `d` is less than or equal to `x`.***
