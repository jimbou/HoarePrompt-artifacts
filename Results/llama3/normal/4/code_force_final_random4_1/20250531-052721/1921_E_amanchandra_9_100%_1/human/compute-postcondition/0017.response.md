Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers, stdin is empty. If `a` is greater than `c`, 'Draw' is printed. If `a` is less than or equal to `c`, either 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob' is printed depending on the absolute difference between `a` and `c`, and the values of `r`, `w`, `d`, `x`, `l`, and `b`.**
