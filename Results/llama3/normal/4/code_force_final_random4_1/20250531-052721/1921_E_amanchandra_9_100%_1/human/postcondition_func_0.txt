This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains six integers representing the dimensions of a board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips. It then determines the winner of a game based on the positions of the chips and prints 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob' depending on the outcome. The function processes all test cases and prints the result for each case, leaving the standard input empty after execution.
