Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains six integers: h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b. h and w are positive integers representing the dimensions of the board. x_a, y_a, x_b, and y_b are positive integers representing the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips on the board, such that 1 <= x_a, x_b <= h and 1 <= y_a, y_b <= w. Additionally, x_a != x_b or y_a != y_b.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is now known to be a positive integer, which represents the number of test cases. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each with six integers representing the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips. The constraints on the values of these integers remain the same as in the initial state.
