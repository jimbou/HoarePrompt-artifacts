Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine the outcome of a game played on a checkered board by two players, Alice and Bob. The game's rules and constraints are provided in the problem description.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1.  The program starts by reading the number of test cases (`t`) and then iterates over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the dimensions of the board (`r` and `w`) and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips (`a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`).
3.  The program first checks if Alice's chip is initially placed below Bob's chip (`a > c`). If this condition is true, it immediately prints "Draw" as the outcome, because Alice cannot win in this scenario.
4.  If Alice's chip is not below Bob's chip, the program calculates the number of moves (`x`) required for Alice to reach Bob's row. It does this by dividing the absolute difference between their initial row positions (`abs(a - c)`) by 2.
5.  The program then checks if the number of moves is odd (`abs(a - c) % 2`). If it is, Alice will have an extra move, and the program calculates the possible column positions (`l` and `r`) that Bob's chip could be in after `x` moves.
6.  If the absolute difference between Bob's column position (`d`) and the possible column positions (`l` and `r`) is less than or equal to `x + 1`, the program prints "Alice" as the outcome, indicating that Alice can win. Otherwise, it prints "Draw".
7.  If the number of moves is even (`abs(a - c) % 2 == 0`), the program calculates the possible column positions (`l` and `r`) that Alice's chip could be in after `x` moves.
8.  If the absolute difference between Alice's column position (`b`) and the possible column positions (`l` and `r`) is less than or equal to `x`, the program prints "Bob" as the outcome, indicating that Bob can win. Otherwise, it prints "Draw".

The program's logic correctly implements the game's rules and constraints, and it accurately determines the outcome of the game based on the initial positions of the chips.

Correctness: **True**
