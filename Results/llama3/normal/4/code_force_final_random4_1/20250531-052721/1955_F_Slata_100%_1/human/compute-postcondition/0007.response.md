Output: **`a` is an integer between 0 and 200, `b` is an integer between 0 and 200, `c` is an integer between 0 and 200, `d` is an integer between 0 and 200, stdin contains an integer t-1 (0 <= t-1 <= 10^4) followed by t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), and this is printed: the sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, plus 1 if the sum of the remainders of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` modulo 2 is equal to 3, otherwise 0, where `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are the current four integers being processed in the iteration number `i`**
