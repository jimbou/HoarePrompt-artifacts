Output State: **`a` is an integer between 0 and 200, `b` is an integer between 0 and 200, `c` is an integer between 0 and 200, `d` is an integer between 0 and 200, stdin contains an integer t-1 (0 <= t-1 <= 10^4) followed by t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), and this is printed: the sum of the integer divisions of a, b, c, and d by 2, plus 1 if the sum of the remainders of a, b, c, and d modulo 2 is equal to 3, otherwise 0, i is the current iteration number + 1**

In this output state, the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are updated to the four integers read from the input, which are between 0 and 200. The stdin now contains one less line, i.e., t-1 lines, each containing four integers. The printed value is calculated based on the updated values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. The current iteration number `i` is incremented by 1.
