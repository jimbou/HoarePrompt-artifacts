Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The problem statement requires us to find the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally. This means we need to find the maximum number of times the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.

2. The XOR of a set of numbers is zero if and only if the number of odd numbers in the set is even. This is because XORing an even number of odd numbers results in zero.

3. The program calculates the sum of the integer division of the input numbers by 2, which gives the number of pairs of each number. It then adds 1 if the sum of the remainders of the input numbers divided by 2 is equal to 3. This is equivalent to checking if the number of odd numbers is even.

4. The program's logic is correct because it correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win. If the number of odd numbers is even, Bob can win by removing the numbers optimally. If the number of odd numbers is odd, Bob cannot win.

5. The program's output matches the expected output for the given examples, which further confirms its correctness.

Correctness: **True**
