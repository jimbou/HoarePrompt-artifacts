Output State: **`a` is an integer between 0 and 200, `b` is an integer between 0 and 200, `c` is an integer between 0 and 200, `d` is an integer between 0 and 200, stdin contains an integer t (0 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200)**

In this output state, the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are assigned the values of the four integers from the input, which are between 0 and 200. The stdin still contains an integer t (0 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), but one line has been consumed by the input operation.
