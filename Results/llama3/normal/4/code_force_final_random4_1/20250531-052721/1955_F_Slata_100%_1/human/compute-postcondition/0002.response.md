The code prints the sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, plus 1 if the sum of the remainders of `a`, `b`, and `c` divided by 2 is 3 (i.e., if exactly three of `a`, `b`, and `c` are odd), and 0 otherwise.

Output: **the sum of the integer divisions of a, b, c, and d by 2, plus 1 if the sum of the remainders of a, b, and c divided by 2 is 3, and 0 otherwise (where a, b, c, and d are integers between 0 and 200)**
