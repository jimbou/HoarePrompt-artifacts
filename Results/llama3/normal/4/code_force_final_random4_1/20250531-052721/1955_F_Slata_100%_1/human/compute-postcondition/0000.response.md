According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input. If the input is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200). So for the loop to be executed  the input must be at least 1 and the i is 0.
State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), i is 0**
