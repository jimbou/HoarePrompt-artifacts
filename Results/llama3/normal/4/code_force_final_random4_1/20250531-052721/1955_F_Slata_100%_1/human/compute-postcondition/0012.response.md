Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers between 0 and 200, stdin contains an integer 0 (0 <= 0 <= 10^4) followed by 0 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), and the sum of the integer division of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2 plus 1 if the sum of the remainder of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` divided by 2 is equal to 3 is being printed**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop executes all its iterations, the input `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` will be the last set of four integers processed by the loop, and the standard input `stdin` will be empty, containing no more lines of input. The loop will have printed the sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, plus 1 if the sum of the remainders of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` modulo 2 is equal to 3, otherwise 0.
