Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers between 0 and 200, stdin contains an integer t-1 (0 <= t-1 <= 10^4) followed by t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200)**

In this output state, the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` have been updated to the first four integers from the input, and the stdin now contains one less line of input. The rest of the precondition remains the same.
