Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

*   The program correctly reads the input, which consists of a series of lines, each containing four integers between 0 and 200.
*   For each line, the program calculates the sum of the integer division of these integers by 2. This is done using the expression `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2`, which correctly calculates the sum of the integer divisions.
*   The program then checks if the sum of the remainders of these integers divided by 2 is equal to 3. This is done using the expression `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3`. If this condition is true, the program adds 1 to the sum calculated in the previous step.
*   Finally, the program prints the calculated sum for each line.

The logic behind the program is correct. The program is trying to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally. The program assumes that Eve will remove the numbers in such a way that the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers is zero, which means Bob wins.

The program uses the fact that the bitwise XOR of a set of numbers is zero if and only if the sum of the remainders of these numbers divided by 2 is even. Therefore, the program checks if the sum of the remainders of the four integers divided by 2 is equal to 3, which means the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers is zero, and Bob wins.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Correctness: **True**
