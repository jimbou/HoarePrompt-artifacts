To determine what will be printed, let's break down the expression inside the `print` statement step by step, considering the initial state provided.

1. **a**, **b**, **c**, and **d** are integers between 0 and 200.
2. The expression to be printed is: `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)`

Let's analyze the parts of the expression:

- `a // 2`, `b // 2`, `c // 2`, and `d // 2`:
  - These are integer divisions of **a**, **b**, **c**, and **d** by 2, respectively. This means each of these variables is divided by 2, and the result is rounded down to the nearest whole number. Since **a**, **b**, **c**, and **d** are integers between 0 and 200, these divisions will result in integers between 0 and 100.

- `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2`:
  - The `%` operator calculates the remainder of the division of the number before it by the number after it. So, `a % 2`, `b % 2`, and `c % 2` will each be 0 if the respective variable is even and 1 if it is odd.
  - The sum `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2` will therefore be an integer between 0 and 3, depending on how many of **a**, **b**, and **c** are odd.

- `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)`:
  - This part of the expression checks if the sum of the remainders (`a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2`) equals 3. This condition is true only if all three variables **a**, **b**, and **c** are odd, because only then will the sum of their remainders be 3.
  - The `int()` function converts the result of this comparison to an integer. In Python, `True` is equivalent to 1 and `False` is equivalent to 0 when converted to integers. Therefore, this part of the expression will be 1 if **a**, **b**, and **c** are all odd and 0 otherwise.

Considering these points, the expression `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` calculates the sum of the integer divisions of **a**, **b**, **c**, and **d** by 2, plus an additional 1 if **a**, **b**, and **c** are all odd.

Output: **The sum of the integer divisions of a, b, c, and d by 2, plus 1 if a, b, and c are all odd.**
