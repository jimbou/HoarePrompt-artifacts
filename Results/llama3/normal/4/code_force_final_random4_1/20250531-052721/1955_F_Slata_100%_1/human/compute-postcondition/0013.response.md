Functionality: **The function reads a series of lines from standard input, where each line contains four integers between 0 and 200. For each line, it calculates the sum of the integer division of these integers by 2, and adds 1 if the sum of the remainders of these integers divided by 2 is equal to 3. The function then prints this calculated sum for each line. After processing all lines, the function leaves the standard input empty.**
