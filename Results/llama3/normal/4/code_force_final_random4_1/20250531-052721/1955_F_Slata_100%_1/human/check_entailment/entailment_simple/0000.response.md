Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The problem requires us to find the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally. This means we need to maximize the number of times the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.

2. The program calculates the number of pairs of each number (1, 2, 3, 4) that can be removed to make the XOR zero. This is done by integer dividing each number by 2.

3. The program then checks if the sum of the remainders of the numbers divided by 2 is equal to 3. If it is, it means that there is one extra number that can be removed to make the XOR zero.

4. The program adds the number of pairs and the extra number (if any) to get the total number of times Bob can win.

5. The program repeats this process for each test case.

The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the number of times Bob can win, and it handles all possible cases.

Correctness: **True**
