The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `int(input())`. If `i` is less than `int(input())`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the current iteration number, `int(input())` is the number of iterations. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1.
State: **`a` is an integer between 0 and 200, `b` is an integer between 0 and 200, `c` is an integer between 0 and 200, `d` is an integer between 0 and 200, stdin contains an integer t (0 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), and this is printed: the sum of the integer divisions of a, b, c, and d by 2, plus 1 if the sum of the remainders of a, b, c, and d modulo 2 is equal to 3, otherwise 0, i is the current iteration number + 1**
