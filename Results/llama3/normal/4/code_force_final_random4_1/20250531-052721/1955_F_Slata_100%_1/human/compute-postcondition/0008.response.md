The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than `int(input())`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is t-1, `int(input())` is t. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is t and for the loop to execute again `int(input())` must be greater than t.
State: **`a` is an integer between 0 and 200, `b` is an integer between 0 and 200, `c` is an integer between 0 and 200, `d` is an integer between 0 and 200, stdin contains an integer t (0 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), and this is printed: the sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, plus 1 if the sum of the remainders of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` modulo 2 is equal to 3, otherwise 0, where `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are the current four integers being processed in the iteration number `i`**
