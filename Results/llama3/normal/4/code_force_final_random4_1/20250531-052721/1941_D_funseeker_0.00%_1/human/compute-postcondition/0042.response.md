Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing all possible remainders of (q + r) divided by n and (q - r) divided by n for all q in the initial set ans, `r` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first part of the string returned by func_1(), `c` is a string equal to the second part of the string returned by func_1(), `temp` is no longer used as it has been assigned to `ans`**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be equal to `temp`, which contains all possible remainders of (q + r) divided by n and (q - r) divided by n for all q in the initial set `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged.
