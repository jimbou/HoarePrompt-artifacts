According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the set `ans`. If the set `ans` has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `ans` has at least 1 element, `q` is the first element in the set `ans`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the set `ans` must have at least 2 elements and `q` is the second element in the set `ans`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least 2 elements, `r` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first part of the string returned by func_1(), `c` is a string equal to the second part of the string returned by func_1(). If `c` is '0', `temp` is a set containing one element which is the remainder of the division of (q + r) by n, and `q` is the second element in the set `ans`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing two elements, one of which is the remainder of the division of (q + r) by n and the other is the remainder of the division of (q - r) by n, and `q` is the second element in the set `ans`.**
