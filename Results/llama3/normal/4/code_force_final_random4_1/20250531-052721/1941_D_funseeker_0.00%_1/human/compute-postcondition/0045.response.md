To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the variable `ans` and `q` since they are the only variables in the loop head.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ans`. If `ans` is not empty, the loop can execute. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `ans` to ensure it is not empty.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 2, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a non-empty set containing all possible remainders of (q + r) divided by n and (q - r) divided by n for all q in the initial set ans, `r` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first part of the string returned by func_1(), `c` is a string equal to the second part of the string returned by func_1(), `temp` is an empty set, `q` is an element in the non-empty set `ans`**
