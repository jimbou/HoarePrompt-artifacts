To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the current state.

The loop head is `for q in ans:`, which means the loop will iterate over the elements of the set `ans`. Since `ans` is a set containing at least 2 elements, we know that there is at least one more element to iterate over.

The current state is:

* `n` is a positive integer
* `m` is greater than 1
* `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n
* `ans` is a set containing at least 2 elements
* `r` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first part of the string returned by func_1()
* `c` is a string equal to the second part of the string returned by func_1()
* If `c` is '0', `temp` is a set containing two elements, one of which is the remainder of the division of (q + r) by n and the other is the remainder of the division of (q + r) by n, and `q` is the second element in the set `ans`
* If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing four elements, one of which is the remainder of the division of (q + r) by n, the other is the remainder of the division of (q - r) by n, the third is the remainder of the division of (q + r) by n, and the fourth is the remainder of the division of (q - r) by n, and `q` is the second element in the set `ans`

To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the next element in the set `ans`. Since `q` is the second element in the set `ans`, we need to increment `q` to point to the next element in the set.

The adjusted state is:

* `n` is a positive integer
* `m` is greater than 1
* `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n
* `ans` is a set containing at least 2 elements
* `r` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first part of the string returned by func_1()
* `c` is a string equal to the second part of the string returned by func_1()
* If `c` is '0', `temp` is a set containing two elements, one of which is the remainder of the division of (next_q + r) by n and the other is the remainder of the division of (next_q + r) by n, and `q` is the next element in the set `ans`
* If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing four elements, one of which is the remainder of the division of (next_q + r) by n, the other is the remainder of the division of (next_q - r) by n, the third is the remainder of the division of (next_q + r) by n, and the fourth is the remainder of the division of (next_q - r) by n, and `q` is the next element in the set `ans`

Note that we don't need to adjust the values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `r`, or `c` because they are not affected by the iteration of the loop.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least 2 elements, `r` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first part of the string returned by func_1(), `c` is a string equal to the second part of the string returned by func_1(), `q` is the next element in the set `ans`, and `temp` is adjusted accordingly based on the value of `c`**
