Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 2, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a non-empty set containing all possible remainders of (q + r) divided by n and (q - r) divided by n for all q in the initial set ans, `r` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first part of the string returned by func_1(), `c` is a string equal to the second part of the string returned by func_1(). If `c` is '1' or '?', then `temp` is a set containing the remainder of (q + r) divided by n and (q - r) divided by n, where `q` is an element in the non-empty set `ans`, `q` is the next element in the set `ans`, and `temp` now contains an additional element which is the remainder of (q + r) divided by n.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `r`, and `c` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is in the set `temp`, which now contains an additional element that is the remainder of `(q + r)` divided by `n`, where `q` is the next element in the set `ans`.
