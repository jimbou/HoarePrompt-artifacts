Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least 1 element, `r` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first part of the string returned by func_1(), `c` is a string equal to the second part of the string returned by func_1(). The current value of `c` is either '1' or '?'. If `c` was '0' or '?', the previous value of `temp` was a set containing one element which is the remainder of the division of (q + r) by n, and `q` was the first element in the set `ans`. The current values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `r`, `temp`, and `q` remain unchanged.***
