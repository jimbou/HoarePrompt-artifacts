Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is greater than 0, x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, ans is a set containing x, r is an integer, c is a string, temp is an empty set**

The code executes as follows:

- The first line assigns the result of `func_1().split()` to `r` and `c`. Since `func_1()` is not defined in the given code snippet, we assume it returns a string that can be split into two parts. The first part is converted to an integer and assigned to `r`, while the second part is assigned to `c` as a string.

- The second line converts the first part of the split result to an integer and assigns it to `r`.

- The third line creates an empty set and assigns it to `temp`.

The variables `n`, `m`, `x`, and `ans` are not modified by the code snippet. Therefore, their values remain the same as in the initial state. The final state includes the new variables `r`, `c`, and `temp`, which are introduced by the code snippet.
