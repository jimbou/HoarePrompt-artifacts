Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem described. It correctly handles the input, processes the throws, and calculates the possible positions of the ball after each throw. The program also correctly handles the case where the direction of a throw is unknown ('?') by considering both clockwise and counterclockwise directions.

The program uses a set to store the possible positions of the ball, which automatically eliminates duplicates. It also correctly handles the case where the ball's position is 0 by replacing it with n, as the problem statement requires the positions to be between 1 and n.

The program's output is also correct, as it prints the number of possible positions and then the positions themselves.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
