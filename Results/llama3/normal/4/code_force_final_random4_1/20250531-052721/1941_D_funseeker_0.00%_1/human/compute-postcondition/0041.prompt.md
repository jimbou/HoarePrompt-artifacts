Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, m is greater than 1, x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, ans is a set containing all possible remainders of (q + r) divided by n and (q - r) divided by n for all q in the initial set ans, r is an integer equal to the integer value of the first part of the string returned by func_1(), c is a string equal to the second part of the string returned by func_1(), temp is an empty set
Code of the loop:
for q in ans:
    if c == '0' or c == '?':
        temp.add((q + r) % n)
    if c == '1' or c == '?':
        temp.add((q - r) % n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least 1 element, `r` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first part of the string returned by func_1(), `c` is a string equal to the second part of the string returned by func_1(). If `c` is '0', `temp` is a set containing one element which is the remainder of the division of (q + r) by n, and `q` is the first element in the set `ans`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing two elements, one of which is the remainder of the division of (q + r) by n and the other is the remainder of the division of (q - r) by n, and `q` is the first element in the set `ans`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least 2 elements, `r` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first part of the string returned by func_1(), `c` is a string equal to the second part of the string returned by func_1(). If `c` is '0', `temp` is a set containing two elements, one of which is the remainder of the division of (q + r) by n and the other is the remainder of the division of (q + r) by n, and `q` is the second element in the set `ans`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing four elements, one of which is the remainder of the division of (q + r) by n, the other is the remainder of the division of (q - r) by n, the third is the remainder of the division of (q + r) by n, and the fourth is the remainder of the division of (q - r) by n, and `q` is the second element in the set `ans`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least 2 elements, `r` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first part of the string returned by func_1(), `c` is a string equal to the second part of the string returned by func_1(), `q` is the next element in the set `ans`. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` contains the element (q + r) % n in addition to its previous elements. If `c` is '1', `temp` contains the element (q - r) % n in addition to its previous elements.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
