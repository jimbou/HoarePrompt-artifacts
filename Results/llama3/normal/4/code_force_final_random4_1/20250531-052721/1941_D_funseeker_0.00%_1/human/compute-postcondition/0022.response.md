To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved accordingly.


The loop head is `for _ in range(m):`. The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable that takes on the value of the current iteration. The loop will execute as long as the current iteration is less than `m`.


At the end of the previous iteration, `m` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, the current iteration must be less than `m`. Since the loop has already executed once, the current iteration is now 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than 1.


The other variables `n`, `x`, `ans`, and `r` are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.


State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` <= `n`, `ans` is a set containing all possible remainders of (`q` + `r`) divided by `n` and (`q` - `r`) divided by `n` for all `q` in the initial set `ans`, `r` is an integer**
