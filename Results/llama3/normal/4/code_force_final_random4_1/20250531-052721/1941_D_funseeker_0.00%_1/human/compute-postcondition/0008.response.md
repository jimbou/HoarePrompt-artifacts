Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` <= `n`, `ans` is a set containing `x` that must have at least 1 element, `r` is an integer, `q` is the first element in the set `ans`, `c` is either '1' or '?', and if `c` is '?', then `temp` is a set containing two elements which are the remainder of (`q` + `r`) divided by `n` and the remainder of (`q` - `r`) divided by `n`, otherwise `temp` is a set containing one element which is the remainder of (`q` - `r`) divided by `n`.**

In this output state, the value of `temp` has been updated based on the initial state. If `c` is '?', then `temp` now contains two elements: the remainder of (`q` + `r`) divided by `n` (which was already present) and the remainder of (`q` - `r`) divided by `n` (which was added by the code). If `c` is not '?', then `temp` now contains only one element: the remainder of (`q` - `r`) divided by `n`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
