Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is greater than 0, x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, ans is an empty set, r is an integer, temp is a set containing all possible remainders of (q + r) divided by n and (q - r) divided by n for all q in the initial set ans.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will have the same values for n, m, x, and r as in the initial state. The set ans will be empty because all its elements have been processed by the loop. The set temp will contain all possible remainders of (q + r) divided by n and (q - r) divided by n for all q in the initial set ans. The number of elements in temp will depend on the value of c and the number of elements in the initial set ans. If c is '1', temp will contain the remainders of (q - r) divided by n for all q in ans. If c is '?', temp will contain the remainders of both (q + r) divided by n and (q - r) divided by n for all q in ans. If c is '0', temp will contain the remainders of (q + r) divided by n for all q in ans.
