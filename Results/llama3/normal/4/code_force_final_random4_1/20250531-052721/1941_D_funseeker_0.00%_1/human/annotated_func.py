#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains one input: a string
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
    #The program returns a string that was provided as input from stdin, with any leading or trailing whitespace removed.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads a string from standard input, removes any leading or trailing whitespace, and returns the resulting string.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: func_1() returns a string that represents an integer
    return int(func_1())
    #The program returns an integer that is represented by the string returned by func_1()

#Overall this is what the function does:Converts a string representation of an integer returned by func_1() to an integer and returns it.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: func_1() returns a string of space-separated integers.
    return list(map(int, func_1().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers that were originally returned as a string of space-separated integers by the function func_1().

#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes no parameters and returns a list of integers. It receives a string of space-separated integers from the function func_1(), splits the string into individual integers, converts them to integers, and returns them as a list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, m is a non-negative integer, and x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n.

    #State: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` <= `n`, `ans` is a set containing all possible remainders of (`q` + `r`) divided by `n` and (`q` - `r`) divided by `n` for all `q` in the initial set `ans`, `r` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1()`, `c` is a string equal to the second part of the string returned by `func_1()`, `temp` is not changed.
    if (0 in ans) :
        ans.discard(0)

    #State: *`n` is a positive integer, `m` is 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` <= `n`, `r` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1()`, `c` is a string equal to the second part of the string returned by `func_1()`, `temp` is not changed. `ans` is a set containing all possible remainders of (`q` + `r`) divided by `n` and (`q` - `r`) divided by `n` for all `q` in the initial set `ans`. If 0 is in the initial set `ans`, then `ans` contains `n`.
    print(len(ans))
    #This is printed: the number of unique remainders that can be obtained by adding and subtracting `r` from each element in the initial set `ans` and taking the result modulo `n`
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: the length of the set `ans` containing all possible remainders of (`q` + `r`) divided by `n` and (`q` - `r`) divided by `n` for all `q` in the initial set `ans`

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and prints the number of unique remainders that can be obtained by adding and subtracting a value `r` from each element in a set `ans` and taking the result modulo `n`, where `n` is a positive integer, `r` is an integer, and `ans` is a set containing a positive integer `x` such that 1 <= `x` <= `n`. The function also prints the set of unique remainders. If 0 is in the set `ans`, it is replaced with `n`. The function performs these calculations `m` times, where `m` is a non-negative integer.
