According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If `m` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `m` is a non-negative integer, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `m` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing `x`**
