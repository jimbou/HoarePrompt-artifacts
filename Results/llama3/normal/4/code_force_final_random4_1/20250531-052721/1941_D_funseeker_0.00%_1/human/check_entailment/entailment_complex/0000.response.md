Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described in the problem statement. The program reads input from standard input, processes it, and prints the output.

The program consists of multiple functions, each with a specific task. The functions are:

1. `func_1()`: Reads a string from standard input, removes any leading or trailing whitespace, and returns the resulting string.
2. `func_2()`: Converts a string representation of an integer returned by `func_1()` to an integer and returns it.
3. `func_3()`: Takes no parameters and returns a list of integers. It receives a string of space-separated integers from `func_1()`, splits the string into individual integers, converts them to integers, and returns them as a list.
4. `func_4()`: Calculates and prints the number of unique remainders that can be obtained by adding and subtracting a value `r` from each element in a set `ans` and taking the result modulo `n`, where `n` is a positive integer, `r` is an integer, and `ans` is a set containing a positive integer `x` such that 1 <= `x` <= `n`. The function also prints the set of unique remainders. If 0 is in the set `ans`, it is replaced with `n`. The function performs these calculations `m` times, where `m` is a non-negative integer.

The program uses a set `ans` to store the possible remainders. It iterates `m` times, each time updating the set `ans` based on the input values `r` and `c`. If `c` is '0' or '?', it adds the remainder of (`q` + `r`) divided by `n` to the set `ans`. If `c` is '1' or '?', it adds the remainder of (`q` - `r`) divided by `n` to the set `ans`. After `m` iterations, the program prints the length of the set `ans` and the set itself.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the cases where `c` is '0', '1', or '?' correctly, and it replaces 0 with `n` in the set `ans` if necessary.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments.

Correctness: **True**
