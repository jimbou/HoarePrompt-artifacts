Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least 1 element, `r` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first part of the string returned by func_1(), `c` is a string equal to the second part of the string returned by func_1() and is either '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing two elements, one of which is the remainder of the division of (q + r) by n and the other is the remainder of the division of (q - r) by n, and `q` is the first element in the set `ans`.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `r`, and `q` remain unchanged. The value of `c` is still either '1' or '?'. The value of `temp` has been updated to include the remainder of the division of (q - r) by n, in addition to its previous value which is the remainder of the division of (q + r) by n.
