Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least 2 elements, `r` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first part of the string returned by func_1(), `c` is a string equal to the second part of the string returned by func_1(). If `c` is '0', `temp` is a set containing two elements, one of which is the remainder of the division of (q + r) by n and the other is the remainder of the division of (q + r) by n, and `q` is the second element in the set `ans`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing four elements, one of which is the remainder of the division of (q + r) by n, the other is the remainder of the division of (q - r) by n, the third is the remainder of the division of (q + r) by n, and the fourth is the remainder of the division of (q - r) by n, and `q` is the second element in the set `ans`.***
