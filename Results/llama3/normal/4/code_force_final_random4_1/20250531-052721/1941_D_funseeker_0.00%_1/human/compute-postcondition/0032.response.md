Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least 2 elements, `r` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first part of the string returned by func_1(), `c` is a string equal to the second part of the string returned by func_1(). If `c` is '0', `temp` is a set containing two elements, one of which is the remainder of the division of (q + r) by n and the other is the remainder of the division of (q + r) by n, and `q` is the second element in the set `ans`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing three elements, one of which is the remainder of the division of (q + r) by n, the other is the remainder of the division of (q - r) by n, and the third is the remainder of the division of (q + r) by n, and `q` is the second element in the set `ans`.**

In this output state, the value of `temp` has been updated by adding the remainder of the division of `(q + r)` by `n`. The other variables remain unchanged. If `c` is '0', `temp` now contains two identical elements, which are the remainder of the division of `(q + r)` by `n`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` now contains three elements, two of which are the remainder of the division of `(q + r)` by `n` and the remainder of the division of `(q - r)` by `n`, and the third is the remainder of the division of `(q + r)` by `n`.
