Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 2, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a non-empty set containing all possible remainders of (q + r) divided by n and (q - r) divided by n for all q in the initial set ans, `r` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first part of the string returned by func_1(), `c` is a string equal to the second part of the string returned by func_1() and the current value of `c` is either '0' or '?', `temp` is an empty set, `q` is an element in the non-empty set `ans`***
