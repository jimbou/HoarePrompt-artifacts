Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, m is greater than 0, x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, ans is a set containing x that must have at least 1 element, r is an integer, q is the first element in the set ans, the current value of c is either '1' or '?', and if c is '?', then temp is a set containing one element which is the remainder of (q + r) divided by n, otherwise temp is an empty set.***
