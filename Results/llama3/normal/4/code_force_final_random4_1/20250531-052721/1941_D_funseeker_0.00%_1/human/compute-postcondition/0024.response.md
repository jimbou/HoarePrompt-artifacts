To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `q` and the set `ans`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the set `ans`. If the set `ans` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least 1 element, `r` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first part of the string returned by func_1(), `c` is a string equal to the second part of the string returned by func_1(), `temp` is an empty set, `q` is the first element in the set `ans`**
