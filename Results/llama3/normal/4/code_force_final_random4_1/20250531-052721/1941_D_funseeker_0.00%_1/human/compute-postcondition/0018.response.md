Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least 3 elements, `r` is an integer, `q` is the next element in the set `ans`. If `c` is '1', then `temp` is a set containing four elements which are the remainder of (q - r) divided by n, the remainder of (q + r) divided by n, the remainder of (q - r) divided by n and the remainder of (q - r) divided by n. If `c` is '?', then `temp` is a set containing five elements which are the remainder of (q + r) divided by n, the remainder of (q - r) divided by n, the remainder of (q + r) divided by n, the remainder of (q - r) divided by n and the remainder of (q - r) divided by n. If `c` is '0', then `temp` is a set containing four elements which are the remainder of (q + r) divided by n, the remainder of (q + r) divided by n, the remainder of (q - r) divided by n and the remainder of (q - r) divided by n.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `r`, and `q` remains the same. The set `temp` now contains an additional element which is the remainder of `(q - r)` divided by `n`. The size of `temp` has increased by one, and its elements depend on the value of `c`.
