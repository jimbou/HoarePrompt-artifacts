The `print(len(ans))` statement will print the number of elements in the set `ans`. The set `ans` contains all possible remainders of (`q` + `r`) divided by `n` and (`q` - `r`) divided by `n` for all `q` in the initial set `ans`. If 0 is in the initial set `ans`, then `ans` contains `n`.

Since the exact values of `n`, `r`, and the initial set `ans` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `len(ans)`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the number of unique remainders that can be obtained by adding and subtracting `r` from each element in the initial set `ans` and taking the result modulo `n`.

Output: **the number of unique remainders that can be obtained by adding and subtracting `r` from each element in the initial set `ans` and taking the result modulo `n`**
