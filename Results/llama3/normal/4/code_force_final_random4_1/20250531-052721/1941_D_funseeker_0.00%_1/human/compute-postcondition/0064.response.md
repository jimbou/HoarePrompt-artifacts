Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is 0, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` <= `n`, `ans` is a set containing all possible remainders of (`q` + `r`) divided by `n` and (`q` - `r`) divided by `n` for all `q` in the initial set `ans`, `r` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1()`, `c` is a string equal to the second part of the string returned by `func_1()`, `temp` is not changed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `n` remains a positive integer, `m` becomes 0 indicating that the loop has finished executing, `x` remains a positive integer within the range 1 to `n`, `ans` contains all possible remainders of adding and subtracting `r` from all elements in the initial set `ans` modulo `n`, `r` and `c` retain their last values from the last iteration of the loop, and `temp` is not modified as it has been assigned to `ans`.
