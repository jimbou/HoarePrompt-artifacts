Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least 1 element, `r` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first part of the string returned by func_1(), `c` is a string equal to the second part of the string returned by func_1() and its current value is either '0' or '?', `temp` is a set containing one element which is the remainder of the division of (q + r) by n, and `q` is the first element in the set `ans`.**

In this output state, the value of `temp` has been updated to include the result of the expression `(q + r) % n`, where `q` is the first element in the set `ans` and `r` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first part of the string returned by func_1(). The other variables remain unchanged.
