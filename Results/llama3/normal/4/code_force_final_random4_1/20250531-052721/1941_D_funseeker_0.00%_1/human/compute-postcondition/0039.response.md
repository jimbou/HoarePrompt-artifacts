Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least 2 elements, `r` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first part of the string returned by func_1(), `c` is a string equal to the second part of the string returned by func_1(), `q` is the next element in the set `ans`. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` contains the elements (q + r) % n in addition to its previous elements. Otherwise, `temp` contains the element (q - r) % n in addition to its previous elements.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `r`, `c`, and `q` remain unchanged. However, the value of `temp` is updated. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` contains the elements (q + r) % n in addition to its previous elements. Otherwise, `temp` contains the element (q - r) % n in addition to its previous elements.
