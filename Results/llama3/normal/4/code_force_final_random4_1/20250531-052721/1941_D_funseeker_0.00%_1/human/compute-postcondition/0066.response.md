Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is 0, x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, ans is a set containing all possible remainders of (q + r) divided by n and (q - r) divided by n for all q in the initial set ans, r is an integer equal to the integer value of the first part of the string returned by func_1(), c is a string equal to the second part of the string returned by func_1(), temp is not changed, ans contains n.**

The code snippet modifies the set `ans` by removing the element 0 and adding the value of `n`. The initial state of `ans` contains 0, so after the execution of the code, `ans` will no longer contain 0 but will contain the value of `n`. The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `r`, `c`, and `temp` remain unchanged.
