Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is an empty set, `r` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first part of the string returned by func_1(), `c` is a string equal to the second part of the string returned by func_1(), `temp` is a set containing all possible remainders of (q + r) divided by n and (q - r) divided by n for all q in the initial set ans.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the set `ans` is empty, and the set `temp` contains all possible remainders of (q + r) divided by n and (q - r) divided by n for all q in the initial set ans. The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `r`, and `c` remain unchanged.
