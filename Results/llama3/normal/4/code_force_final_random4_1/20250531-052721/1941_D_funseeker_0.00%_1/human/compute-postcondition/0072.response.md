Functionality: **This function calculates and prints the number of unique remainders that can be obtained by adding and subtracting a value `r` from each element in a set `ans` and taking the result modulo `n`, where `n` is a positive integer, `r` is an integer, and `ans` is a set containing a positive integer `x` such that 1 <= `x` <= `n`. The function also prints the set of unique remainders. If 0 is in the set `ans`, it is replaced with `n`. The function performs these calculations `m` times, where `m` is a non-negative integer.**
