Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is greater than 2, x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, ans is a non-empty set containing all possible remainders of (q + r) divided by n and (q - r) divided by n for all q in the initial set ans, r is an integer equal to the integer value of the first part of the string returned by func_1(), c is a string equal to the second part of the string returned by func_1(), temp is a set containing all possible remainders of (q + r) divided by n and (q - r) divided by n for all q in the set ans.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `r`, and `c` remain unchanged. However, `temp` is now a set containing all possible remainders of `(q + r)` divided by `n` and `(q - r)` divided by `n` for all `q` in the set `ans`. This is because the loop iterates over all elements in `ans`, adding the remainders of `(q + r)` and `(q - r)` divided by `n` to `temp` for each `q`.
