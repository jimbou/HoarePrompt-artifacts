The code accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains multiple test cases, each with three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3. Since the code only reads one integer, the remaining test cases are still in the stdin.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases, each with three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 (0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30)**
