Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `v` is a list of three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 (0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30) from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as a positive integer greater than 1. The value of `_` also remains unchanged as 1. The value of `v` is updated to a list of three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 (0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30) from the input. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus three, as one test case has been consumed by the input operation.
