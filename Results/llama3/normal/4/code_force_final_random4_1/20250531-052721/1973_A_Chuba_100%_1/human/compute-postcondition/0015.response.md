Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `v` is a list of three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 (0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30) from the input, `result` is the average of the two smallest numbers in `v` if the sum of the two smallest numbers is greater than or equal to the largest number, otherwise it is the average of the two smallest numbers plus the difference between the largest number and the sum of the two smallest numbers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three.**

In natural language, the output state is that the value of `result` is calculated based on the values of `v`, which is a list of three integers. If the sum of the two smallest numbers in `v` is greater than or equal to the largest number, then `result` is the average of the two smallest numbers. Otherwise, `result` is the average of the two smallest numbers plus the difference between the largest number and the sum of the two smallest numbers. The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged, and the stdin contains multiple test cases minus three.
