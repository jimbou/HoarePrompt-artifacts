Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly handles the case where the total score is odd, in which case it prints -1. For even total scores, it calculates the maximum possible number of draws by subtracting the maximum possible wins (which is the difference between the highest score and the sum of the two lower scores) from the total score and dividing by 2. This is because each draw contributes 2 points to the total score, so the maximum number of draws is half of the total score minus the maximum possible wins.

Correctness: **True**
