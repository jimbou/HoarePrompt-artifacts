To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `_` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 0 and `t` is a positive integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `v` is a list of three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 (0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30), stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**
