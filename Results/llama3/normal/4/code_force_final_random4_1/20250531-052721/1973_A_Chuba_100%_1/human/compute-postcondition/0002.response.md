Output State: **`t` is a positive integer that must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `v` is a list of three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 (0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30), stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**.

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `_` also remains unchanged as it is not used in the code. The variable `v` is assigned a list of three integers from the input, where `input().split()` accepts a space-separated list of integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The stdin contains multiple test cases, but one test case has been consumed by the `input()` function, so the number of test cases in stdin is reduced by one.
