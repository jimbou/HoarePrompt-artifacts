Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `v` is a list of three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 (0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30) from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four. If the sum of the elements in `v` is odd, -1 is printed. Otherwise, the result is calculated as (p_1 + p_2 + p_3 - max(0, p_3 - p_1 - p_2)) // 2 and printed.***
