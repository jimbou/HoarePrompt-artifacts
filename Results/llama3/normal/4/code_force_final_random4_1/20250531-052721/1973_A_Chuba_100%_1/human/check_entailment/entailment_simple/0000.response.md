Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the scores of the three players `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` and stores them in the list `v`.
3.  The program then checks if the sum of the scores is odd. If it is, the program prints `-1` because the sum of scores must be even (each game contributes either 2 or 0 points to the sum of scores). This is a correct check.
4.  If the sum of scores is even, the program calculates the maximum number of draws that could have happened. The formula used is `(p_1 + p_2 + p_3 - max(0, p_3 - p_1 - p_2)) // 2`.

    *   The expression `p_1 + p_2 + p_3` represents the total number of points earned by all players.
    *   The expression `max(0, p_3 - p_1 - p_2)` represents the minimum number of points that must have been earned by the players through wins (i.e., 2 points per win). This is because `p_3` is the maximum score, and `p_1` and `p_2` are the minimum and middle scores, respectively. The `max` function ensures that this value is not negative.
    *   By subtracting the minimum number of points earned through wins from the total number of points, the program gets the maximum number of points that could have been earned through draws (i.e., 1 point per draw).
    *   Finally, the program divides this value by 2 to get the maximum number of draws, because each draw contributes 1 point to the total number of points earned through draws.

    This formula is correct and ensures that the program prints the maximum possible number of draws that could have happened.

5.  The program prints the calculated result for each test case.

Therefore, the given program is correct.
