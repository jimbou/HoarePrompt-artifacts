Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the maximum number of draws that could have happened in a series of chess games between three friends, given their final scores.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the scores of the three players `v[0]`, `v[1]`, and `v[2]`, which are guaranteed to be in non-decreasing order.

3. The program then checks if the sum of the scores is odd. If it is, the program prints `-1` and moves on to the next test case. This is because the total number of points awarded in any number of games must be even (each game awards 2 points in total), so an odd sum of scores is impossible.

4. If the sum of the scores is even, the program calculates the maximum number of draws that could have happened. It does this by subtracting the maximum possible number of wins (which is `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])`) from the total number of points awarded, and then dividing the result by 2. This is because each draw awards 1 point to each player, so the maximum number of draws is half the number of points that are not accounted for by wins.

5. Finally, the program prints the calculated maximum number of draws.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
