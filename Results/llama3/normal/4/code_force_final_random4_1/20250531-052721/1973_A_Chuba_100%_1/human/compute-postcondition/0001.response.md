The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer, which ensures that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and `_` is now 0. 
State: **`t` is a positive integer that must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases, each with three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 (0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30)**
