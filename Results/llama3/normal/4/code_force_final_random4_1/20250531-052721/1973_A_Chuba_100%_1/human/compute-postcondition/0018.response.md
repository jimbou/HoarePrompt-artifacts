Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `v` is a list of three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 (0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30) from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three. If the sum of the three integers in `v` is odd, -1 is printed. Otherwise, if the sum of the two smallest numbers in `v` is greater than or equal to the largest number, the average of the two smallest numbers is printed. Otherwise, the average of the two smallest numbers plus the difference between the largest number and the sum of the two smallest numbers is printed.**
