Output State: **`t` is 0, `_` is `t`, `v` is a list of three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 (0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30) from the input, stdin is empty. If the sum of the elements in `v` is odd, -1 is printed. Otherwise, the result is calculated as (p_1 + p_2 + p_3 - max(0, p_3 - p_1 - p_2)) // 2 and printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `t` will be 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The value of `_` will be equal to the initial value of `t`, indicating the number of iterations that have been completed. The value of `v` will be the last set of three integers read from the input, and the input will be empty. The output will be either -1 if the sum of the elements in `v` is odd, or the calculated result if the sum is even.
