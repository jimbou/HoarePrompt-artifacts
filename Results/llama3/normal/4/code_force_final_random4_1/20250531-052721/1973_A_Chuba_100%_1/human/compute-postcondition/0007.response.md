Output State: **`t` is a positive integer that must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `v` is a list of three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 (0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30), `result` is an integer equal to (p_1 + p_2 + p_3 - max(0, p_3 - p_1 - p_2)) // 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and the sum of the elements in `v` is even**

In this output state, the value of `result` is calculated based on the values of `v`. The expression `max(0, p_3 - p_1 - p_2)` ensures that the result is always non-negative. The `// 2` operation performs integer division, which means the result will be an integer. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
