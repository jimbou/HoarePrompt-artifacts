Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python program correctly determines the maximum number of draws that could have happened in a series of chess games between three friends. The program takes into account the scores of the three players, which are guaranteed to be in non-decreasing order.

The program first checks if the sum of the scores is odd. If it is, the program prints -1, indicating that there is no valid set of games that could have resulted in the given scores. This is because each game can only result in an even number of points being awarded (either 2 points for a win, 0 points for a loss, or 1 point for a draw).

If the sum of the scores is even, the program calculates the maximum number of draws that could have happened. It does this by subtracting the maximum possible number of points that could have been awarded for wins and losses (i.e., `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])`) from the total number of points awarded. The result is then divided by 2, since each draw results in 1 point being awarded to each player.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible cases. For example, if the scores are (0, 0, 0), the program correctly prints 0, indicating that no games were played. If the scores are (0, 1, 1), the program correctly prints 1, indicating that one game was played and resulted in a draw.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
