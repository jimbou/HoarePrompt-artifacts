Output: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `v` is a list of three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 (0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30) from the input, `result` is an integer equal to (p_1 + p_2 + p_3 - max(0, p_3 - p_1 - p_2)) // 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four, and the result is printed, where result is (p_1 + p_2 + p_3 - max(0, p_3 - p_1 - p_2)) // 2**
