Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `v` is a list of three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 (0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30) from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four**

In this output state, the value of `v` has been updated to a list of three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 (0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30) from the input. The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus four, as one test case has been consumed by the input operation.
