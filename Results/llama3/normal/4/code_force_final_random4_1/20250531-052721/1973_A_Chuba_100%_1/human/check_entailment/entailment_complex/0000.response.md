Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the scores of the three players `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` and stores them in the list `v`.
3.  It checks if the sum of the scores is odd. If it is, the program prints `-1` because the total score must be even (each game contributes either 2 or 0 points to the total score). This is a correct condition to check for invalid scores.
4.  If the sum of the scores is even, the program calculates the maximum possible number of draws using the formula `(p_1 + p_2 + p_3 - max(0, p_3 - p_1 - p_2)) // 2`. This formula is correct because it subtracts the maximum possible number of wins (which is `max(0, p_3 - p_1 - p_2)`) from the total score and then divides by 2 to get the number of draws.
5.  The program prints the calculated result for each test case.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible number of draws given the scores of the three players.

Correctness: **True**
