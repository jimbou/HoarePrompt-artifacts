The `print(result)` statement will print the calculated value of `result`, which is an integer equal to `(p_1 + p_2 + p_3 - max(0, p_3 - p_1 - p_2)) // 2`.

Here, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are the three integers from the input, where `0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30`. The `max(0, p_3 - p_1 - p_2)` expression calculates the maximum of 0 and the difference between `p_3` and the sum of `p_1` and `p_2`. This value is then subtracted from the sum of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3`, and the result is divided by 2 using integer division (`//`).

Since the exact values of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `result`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `result` for each test case.

Output: **result (where result is the calculated value of (p_1 + p_2 + p_3 - max(0, p_3 - p_1 - p_2)) // 2 for each test case)**
