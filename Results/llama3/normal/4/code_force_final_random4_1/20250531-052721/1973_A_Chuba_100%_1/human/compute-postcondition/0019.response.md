The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `v` is a list of three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 (0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30) from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three**
