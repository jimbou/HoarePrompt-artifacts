Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases, each with three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 (0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30)
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    v = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if (v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1:
        print('-1')
    else:
        result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2
        print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `v` is a list of three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 (0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30), stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If the sum of the elements in `v` is an odd number, -1 is printed. If the sum of the elements in `v` is an even number, the result which is equal to (p_1 + p_2 + p_3 - max(0, p_3 - p_1 - p_2)) // 2 is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `v` is a list of three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 (0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30) from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three. If the sum of the three integers in `v` is odd, -1 is printed. Otherwise, if the sum of the two smallest numbers in `v` is greater than or equal to the largest number, the average of the two smallest numbers is printed. Otherwise, the average of the two smallest numbers plus the difference between the largest number and the sum of the two smallest numbers is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `v` is a list of three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 (0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30) from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four. If the sum of the elements in `v` is odd, -1 is printed. Otherwise, the result is calculated as (p_1 + p_2 + p_3 - max(0, p_3 - p_1 - p_2)) // 2 and printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
