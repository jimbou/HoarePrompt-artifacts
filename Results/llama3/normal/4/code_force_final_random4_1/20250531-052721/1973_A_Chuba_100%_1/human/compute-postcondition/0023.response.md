Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `v` is a list of three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 (0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30) from the input, `result` is an integer equal to (p_1 + p_2 + p_3 - max(0, p_3 - p_1 - p_2)) // 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains a positive integer greater than 2, and the value of `_` remains 2. The list `v` still contains three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3, which are within the range 0 to 30 and are in non-decreasing order. A new variable `result` is introduced, which is calculated based on the values in list `v`. The value of `result` is an integer that represents the minimum number of operations required to make the three integers in `v` equal. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus four.
