Reasoning:
The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of all numbers in an n x n matrix by performing a series of operations. The program reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains a single integer n. For each test case, it calculates a sum using a formula and prints the sum along with the value of n plus n. Additionally, it prints a series of numbers in a specific pattern for each iteration of a loop.

The program's logic is based on the idea of maximizing the sum of the numbers in the matrix by assigning the largest possible values to the elements of the matrix. The formula used to calculate the sum is derived from the fact that the sum of the numbers in the matrix is equal to the sum of the squares of the numbers from 1 to n.

The program's output is in the correct format, with the sum and the number of operations printed on the first line, followed by the description of each operation on subsequent lines. The operations are of type 1 and type 2, which correspond to assigning values to the elements of the matrix and swapping the rows and columns of the matrix, respectively.

The program's time complexity is O(t \* n), where t is the number of test cases and n is the size of the matrix. This is because the program reads t test cases and for each test case, it performs n iterations of the loop.

The program's space complexity is O(1), which means that it uses a constant amount of space. This is because the program only uses a fixed amount of space to store the input and output values, and it does not use any data structures that grow with the size of the input.

Overall, the program is correct and efficient. It solves the problem by using a formula to calculate the sum and by printing the description of each operation in the correct format.

Correctness: **True**
