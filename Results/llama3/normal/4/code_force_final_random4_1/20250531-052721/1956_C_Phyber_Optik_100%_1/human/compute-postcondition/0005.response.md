To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. Since `n` must be at least 2, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 3.

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 499, `n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `sum` is 1 + (2 * 2 - (2 - 1) * (2 - 1)) * 2, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `i` is 3**
