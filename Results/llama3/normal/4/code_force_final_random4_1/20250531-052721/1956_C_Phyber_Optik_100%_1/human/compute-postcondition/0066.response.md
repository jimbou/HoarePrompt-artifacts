Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 499, `n` is an integer that must be at least `n`, `sum` is 1 + (2 * 2 - (2 - 1) * (2 - 1)) * 2 + (3 * 3 - (3 - 1) * (3 - 1)) * 3 + ... + (n * n - (n - 1) * (n - 1)) * n, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four test cases, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n + 1`.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is such that `t` remains an integer between 2 and 499, `n` remains an integer that must be at least `n`, and `_` remains 2. The `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus four test cases. The value of `sum` is the sum of the expression `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` for all `i` from 2 to `n`. The loop variable `i` is now `n + 1`, and `j` is also `n + 1`.
