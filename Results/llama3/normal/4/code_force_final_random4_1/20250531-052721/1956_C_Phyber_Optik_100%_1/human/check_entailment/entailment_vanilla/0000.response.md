Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of all numbers in an n x n matrix by performing two types of operations: Type 1 operation (choosing an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, ..., p_n of integers from 1 to n, and assigning a_{i, j} := p_j for all 1 <= j <= n simultaneously) and Type 2 operation (choosing an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, ..., p_n of integers from 1 to n, and assigning a_{j, i} := p_j for all 1 <= j <= n simultaneously).

The program first calculates the maximum sum that can be obtained by performing these operations. It does this by iterating over the range from 2 to n (inclusive) and adding the difference between the square of the current number and the square of the previous number, multiplied by the current number, to the sum.

After calculating the maximum sum, the program prints the sum and the number of operations required to achieve this sum, which is 2n. Then, it prints the operations required to achieve this sum. For each row and column, it prints a Type 1 operation and a Type 2 operation, with the permutation being the range from 1 to n (inclusive).

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the correct output for the given problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
