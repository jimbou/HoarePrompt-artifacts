To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(2, n + 1):`. The variables involved are `i` and `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3, and `n` is an integer that must be at least 3.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n + 1`. Since `i` is 3, `n` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute again.

So, we adjust the states as follows:

* `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now 4.
* `n` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables in the state, such as `t`, `sum`, `_`, `stdin`, and the printed values, are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 499, `n` is an integer that must be at least 4, `sum` is 1 + ∑((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i) for `i` from 2 to `n` + ((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i) for `i` = 3, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `i` is 4, the sum which is equal to 1 + ∑((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i) for `i` from 2 to `n` and the value of `n` plus `n` which is equal to 2 * `n` are printed, and this is printed: 1, 1, and the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive, which are the numbers from 1 to `n`, and this is printed: 2, 1, and the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive, which are the numbers from 1 to `n`.**
