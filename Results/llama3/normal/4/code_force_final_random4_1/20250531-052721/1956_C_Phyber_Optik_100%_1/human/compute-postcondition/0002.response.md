Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 499, n is an integer, sum is 1, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases**

The code consists of two lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `t` is an integer between 1 and 500, and `t` must be greater than 0, `t` becomes an integer between 0 and 499 after one test case is consumed. The second line assigns the value 1 to `sum`. No other variables are affected.
