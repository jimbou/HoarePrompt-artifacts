The only variables in the loop head are variables  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 0. At the for the j is increased by 1 so j is 2 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 499, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 1, `sum` is 1 + ∑((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i) for `i` from 2 to `n`, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `i` is `n + 1`, the sum which is equal to 1 + ∑((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i) for `i` from 2 to `n` and the value of `n` plus `n` which is equal to 2 * `n` are printed, and this is printed: 1, 1, and the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive, which are the numbers from 1 to `n`, and this is printed: 2, 1, and the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive, which are the numbers from 1 to `n`, and this is printed: sum which is equal to 1 + ∑((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i) for `i` from 2 to `n` and 2 * `n`, `j` is 2, and this is printed: 1, `n` and the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive, and this is printed: 2, `n` minus `j` plus 1 which is equal to `n`, and the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive, which are the numbers from 1 to `n`**
