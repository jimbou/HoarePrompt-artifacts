The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer between 0 and 499, and `_` is 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `t` must be greater than 0 and `_` is 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 499, `n` is an integer that must be at least `n`, `sum` is 1 + ∑((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i) for i from 2 to `n`, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `i` is `n + 1`, the sum which is equal to 1 + ∑((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i) for i from 2 to `n` and the value of `n` plus `n` which is equal to 2 * `n` are printed, and this is printed: 1, 1, and the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive, which are the numbers from 1 to `n`, and this is printed: 2, 1, and the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive, which are the numbers from 1 to `n**
