The code prints the number 1, the value of `n - j + 1` which is `n - 1` since `j` is 2, and the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) in a sequence.
Output: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 499, `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `sum` is 1 + âˆ‘((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i) for i from 2 to `n`, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is 2, and this is printed: 1, n - 1, and the numbers from 1 to n**
