The `print` statement will print a sequence of numbers. The first number is 1, the second number is `n - j + 1`, and the remaining numbers are a range of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

Since `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, and `j` is at least 2 and at most `n + 1`, the value of `n - j + 1` will be between 0 and `n - 1` (inclusive).

The `*range(1, n + 1)` part of the print statement will print a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`, separated by spaces.

Therefore, the output will be a sequence of numbers starting with 1, followed by a number between 0 and `n - 1`, and then a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`.

Output: **1, [n - j + 1], 1, 2, ..., n (where n - j + 1 is a number between 0 and n - 1, and the remaining numbers are a sequence from 1 to n)**
