Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 499, `n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `sum` is 1 + (2 * 2 - (2 - 1) * (2 - 1)) * 2 + (3 * 3 - (3 - 1) * (3 - 1)) * 3, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four test cases, `i` is 3, `j` is `n + 1`**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` is still an integer between 2 and 499, `n` is still an integer that must be at least 3, `sum` has been updated to include the new calculation based on `i` which is 3, `_` remains 2, `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus four test cases, `i` is still 3, and `j` is still `n + 1`.
