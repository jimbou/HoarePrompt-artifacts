Based on the initial state, the print statement will print the following:

* The number 2
* The value of `n - j + 1`, which is equal to `n` since `j` is 1
* The numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive, which are the numbers from 1 to `n`

So, the output will be a sequence of numbers starting from 2, followed by the value of `n`, and then the numbers from 1 to `n`.

Output: **2, n, 1, 2, 3, ..., n**
