Based on the precondition, let's break down the variables and objects involved in the print statement:

* `sum`: This is a calculated value that represents the sum of a series of terms, where each term is calculated as `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` for `i` ranging from 2 to `n`. Since `n` is an integer that must be at least `n`, we can assume that `n` is a fixed value. However, without knowing the exact value of `n`, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `sum`.
* `n + n`: This is a simple arithmetic expression that doubles the value of `n`.

Given these descriptions, we can now determine what will be printed when the statement executes:

The code prints the calculated sum of the series (which is `sum`) and the doubled value of `n` (which is `n + n`).

Output: **sum (where sum is the sum of the series 1 + âˆ‘((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i) for i from 2 to n), 2n (where n is the integer that must be at least n)**
