The only variables in the loop head are variables  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at least 2 and at most `n + 1`, `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again `j` must be increased by 1 and for the loop to execute again `j` must be less than `n + 1`. So `j` is at least 3 and at most `n + 1` and `n` is at least 2.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 499, `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `sum` is 1 + (2 * 2 - (2 - 1) * (2 - 1)) * 2 + (3 * 3 - (3 - 1) * (3 - 1)) * 3 + ... + (n * n - (n - 1) * (n - 1)) * n, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus five test cases, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is at least 3 and at most `n + 1`, and this is printed: "2, [n - j + 1], 1, 2, 3, ..., n"**
