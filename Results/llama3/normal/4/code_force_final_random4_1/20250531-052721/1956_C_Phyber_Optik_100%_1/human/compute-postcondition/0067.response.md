Based on the precondition, we can analyze the code as follows:

* `sum` is a variable that contains the sum of a series of calculations, which can be described as the sum of the squares of the numbers from 2 to `n`, where each square is multiplied by the corresponding number.
* `n` is an integer that must be at least `n`, which means `n` is a fixed value that is at least as large as itself.
* `n + n` is an expression that adds `n` to itself, resulting in a value that is twice the value of `n`.

When the `print` statement is executed, it will print the value of `sum` followed by the value of `n + n`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `n`, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `sum` or `n + n`. However, based on the structure of the problem, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **sum (where sum is the sum of the squares of the numbers from 2 to n, multiplied by the corresponding number), 2n (where n is the fixed value of n)**
