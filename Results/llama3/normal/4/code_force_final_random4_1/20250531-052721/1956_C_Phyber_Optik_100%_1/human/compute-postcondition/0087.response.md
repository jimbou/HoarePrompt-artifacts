Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains a single integer n. For each test case, it calculates a sum using a formula and prints the sum along with the value of n plus n. Additionally, it prints a series of numbers in a specific pattern for each iteration of a loop. The function does not return any value but modifies the standard output by printing the calculated sum and the series of numbers.**
