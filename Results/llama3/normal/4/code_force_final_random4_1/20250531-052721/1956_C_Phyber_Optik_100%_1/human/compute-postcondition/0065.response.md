Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 499, `n` is an integer that must be at least 4, `sum` is 1 + (2 * 2 - (2 - 1) * (2 - 1)) * 2 + (3 * 3 - (3 - 1) * (3 - 1)) * 3 + (4 * 4 - (4 - 1) * (4 - 1)) * 4, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four test cases, `i` is 4, `j` is `n + 1`**

In this output state, the value of `sum` has been updated by adding the expression `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` to its previous value. Since `i` is 4, this expression evaluates to `(4 * 4 - (4 - 1) * (4 - 1)) * 4`, which is added to the previous value of `sum`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
