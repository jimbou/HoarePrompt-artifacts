To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `j` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer that must be at least `n`, which means `n` is already constrained to be at least `n`, but we need to ensure it's at least 1 for the loop to execute. Therefore, we need to adjust `n` to be at least 1. Additionally, since `j` is the loop variable, we need to set its initial value to 1, which is the starting value of the range.

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 499, `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `sum` is 1 + ∑((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i) for i from 2 to `n`, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `i` is `n + 1`, the sum which is equal to 1 + ∑((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i) for i from 2 to `n` and the value of `n` plus `n` which is equal to 2 * `n` are printed, `j` is 1**
