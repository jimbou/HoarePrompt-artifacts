The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 499. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 499, `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to `n`, `sum` is 1 + ∑((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i) for `i` from 2 to `n`, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `i` is `n + 1`, the sum which is equal to 1 + ∑((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i) for `i` from 2 to `n` and the value of `n` plus `n` which is equal to 2 * `n` are printed, and this is printed: 1, 1, and the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive, which are the numbers from 1 to `n`, and this is printed: 2, 1, and the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive,
