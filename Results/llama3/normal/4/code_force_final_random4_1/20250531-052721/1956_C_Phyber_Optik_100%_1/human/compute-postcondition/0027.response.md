Output State: `t` is an integer between 0 and 499, `n` is an integer that must be at least `n`, `sum` is 1 + ∑((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i) for i from 2 to `n`, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `i` is `n + 1`, the sum which is equal to 1 + ∑((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i) for i from 2 to `n` and the value of `n` plus `n` which is equal to 2 * `n` are printed, `j` is `n + 1`, and this is printed: 1, 0, and the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive, which are the numbers from 1 to `n`, and this is printed: 2, 0, and the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive, which are the numbers from 1 to `n`.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, with the addition of the values of `j` and the printed output. The loop iterates `n` times, and in each iteration, it prints the values of `j` and the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive. After the loop finishes, the value of `j` is `n + 1`, and the printed output includes the values of `j` and the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive for each iteration.
