The code prints the number 2, the value of `n` minus `j` plus 1, and the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

Since `j` is 3, `n` minus `j` plus 1 is equal to `n` minus 2.

So, the code prints the number 2, the value of `n` minus 2, and the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

Output: **2, n - 2, 1, 2, 3, ..., n (where n is the value of n)**
