To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is at least 2.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `i` is now 3, `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 499, `n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `sum` is 1 + ∑((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i) for `i` from 2 to `n`, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `i` is 3, the sum which is equal to 1 + ∑((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i) for `i` from 2 to `n` and the value of `n` plus `n` which is equal to 2 * `n` are printed, and this is printed: 1, 1, and the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive, which are the numbers from 1 to `n`, and this is printed: 2, 1, and the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive, which are the numbers from 1 to `n`.**
