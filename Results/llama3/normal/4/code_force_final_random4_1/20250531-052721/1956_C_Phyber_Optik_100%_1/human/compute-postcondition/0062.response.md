According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 499, `n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `sum` is 1 + (2 * 2 - (2 - 1) * (2 - 1)) * 2, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four test cases, `i` is 3, `j` is `n + 1`**
