The `print` statement will print a sequence of numbers starting from 1, followed by the value of `n - j + 1`, and then a range of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

Here's a breakdown of the values:

* `1`: This is a literal integer value that will be printed as is.
* `n - j + 1`: This expression evaluates to an integer value between 1 and `n` (inclusive), since `j` is at least 1 and at most `n`. The exact value depends on the values of `n` and `j`.
* `*range(1, n + 1)`: This will print a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), separated by spaces. The `*` operator unpacks the range object into individual arguments to the `print` function.

Since the exact values of `n` and `j` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `n - j + 1`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output a sequence of numbers starting from 1, followed by a value between 1 and `n` (inclusive), and then a range of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

Output: **1, [n - j + 1] (where n - j + 1 is an integer between 1 and n), 1, 2, ..., n (where n is the value of n)**
