Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 499, `n` is an integer that must be at least 4, `sum` is 1 + ∑((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i) for `i` from 2 to `n` + ((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i) for `i` = 3 + ((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i) for `i` = 4, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `i` is 5, the sum which is equal to 1 + ∑((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i) for `i` from 2 to `n` and the value of `n` plus `n` which is equal to 2 * `n` are printed, and this is printed: 1, 1, and the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive, which are the numbers from 1 to `n`, and this is printed: 2, 1, and the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive, which are the numbers from 1 to `n`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `sum` has been updated by adding the result of the expression `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` for `i` = 4. The value of `i` has been incremented to 5. All other variables remain unchanged.
