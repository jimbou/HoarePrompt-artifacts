Output State: `t` is an integer between 2 and 499, `n` is an integer that must be at least `n`, `sum` is 1 + (2 * 2 - (2 - 1) * (2 - 1)) * 2 + (3 * 3 - (3 - 1) * (3 - 1)) * 3 + ... + (n * n - (n - 1) * (n - 1)) * n, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four test cases, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n + 1`, and this is printed: the sum which is equal to 1 + (2 * 2 - (2 - 1) * (2 - 1)) * 2 + (3 * 3 - (3 - 1) * (3 - 1)) * 3 + ... + (n * n - (n - 1) * (n - 1)) * n and 2 times n which is equal to 2n.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, with the only difference being that `j` is now `n + 1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The values of `t`, `n`, `sum`, `_`, `stdin`, and `i` remain unchanged. The loop has printed the sum and 2 times `n` for each iteration, but the final output state does not reflect any changes to these variables.
