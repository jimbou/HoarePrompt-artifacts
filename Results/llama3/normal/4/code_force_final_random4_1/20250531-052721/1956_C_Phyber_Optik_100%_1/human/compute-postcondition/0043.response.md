The code prints the number 2, the value of `n` minus `j` plus 1, and the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
Since `j` is 1, `n` minus `j` plus 1 is equal to `n`.
The numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive are printed using the `range(1, n + 1)` function.
Output: **2, n, and the numbers from 1 to n inclusive (where n is the value of n)**
