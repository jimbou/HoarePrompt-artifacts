To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for j in range(1, n + 1):`. The objects involved are `j` and `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is at least 1 and at most `n`, and `n` is an integer that must be at least 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n + 1`. Since `j` is at most `n`, we can increment `j` by 1 to make it less than `n + 1`.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `j` is at least 2 and at most `n + 1`
* `n` remains the same, an integer that must be at least 1

The other variables (`t`, `sum`, `_`, `stdin`, `i`) are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not change.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 499, `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `sum` is 1 + (2 * 2 - (2 - 1) * (2 - 1)) * 2 + (3 * 3 - (3 - 1) * (3 - 1)) * 3 + ... + (n * n - (n - 1) * (n - 1)) * n, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four test cases, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is at least 2 and at most `n + 1`**
