According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 0 and 499, `n` is an integer, `sum` is 1, `_` is 0, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two test cases. However, these states do not ensure that the loop will execute. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be at least 2 and `i` to be 2.

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 499, `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `sum` is 1, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `i` is 2**
