The code prints the number 1, the value of `n` minus `j` plus 1, and the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive). 

Since `j` is 1, `n - j + 1` is equal to `n`. 

The `*range(1, n + 1)` expression generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

Output: **1, n, 1, 2, 3, ..., n (where n is the value of n)**
