Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when n = 1. In this case, the program prints "1 2" which means it is performing 2 operations, but it only needs to perform 1 operation to maximize the sum of the matrix. The correct output for this case should be "1 1" followed by "1 1 1". 

The issue is with the line `print(sum, n + n)`. This line always prints `n + n` as the number of operations, but it should print `n` when `n` is 1. 

To fix this, the program should add a special case for when `n` is 1.
