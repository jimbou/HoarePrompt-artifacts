The code prints the value 1, the value of `n - j + 1` (where `n` is an integer that must be at least 1 and `j` is 2), and the values of all integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), where `n` is an integer that must be at least 1.

Output: **1, n - 1, 1, 2, 3, ..., n (where n is an integer that must be at least 1)**
