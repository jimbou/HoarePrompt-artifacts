Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 499, `n` is an integer that must be at least `n`, `sum` is 1 + âˆ‘((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i) for i from 2 to `n`, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `i` is `n + 1`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is as follows:

- The value of `t` remains unchanged, still an integer between 0 and 499.
- The value of `n` is at least `n`, meaning it's the same as the initial value of `n` since `n` doesn't change within the loop.
- The value of `sum` is the result of adding the initial value of 1 to the sum of the expression `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` for all `i` from 2 to `n`. This represents the accumulation of the results of the expression for each iteration of the loop.
- The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0.
- The state of `stdin` remains unchanged, containing multiple test cases minus two test cases, as the loop does not affect `stdin`.
- The value of `i` is `n + 1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations from 2 to `n`.
