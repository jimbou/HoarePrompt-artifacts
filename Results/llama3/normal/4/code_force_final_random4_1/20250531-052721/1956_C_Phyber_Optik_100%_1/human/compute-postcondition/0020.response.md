The `print` statement will print the following values:

- The number 2
- The value of `n - j + 1`, where `n` is an integer that must be at least 1 and `j` is 2. This expression simplifies to `n - 1`.
- The numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), generated by the `range(1, n + 1)` function.

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `n - 1`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the number 2, the value of `n - 1`, and the numbers from 1 to `n`.

Output: **2, n - 1, 1, 2, 3, ..., n (where n is an integer that must be at least 1)**
