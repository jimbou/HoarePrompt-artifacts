The only objects in the loop head are variables  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer that must be at least `n`, which means `n` is at least `n`. This is a tautology, so `n` can be any integer. However, the loop will only execute if `n` is at least 1. Therefore, `n` must be at least 1. Also, `j` is `n + 1` before the loop starts, but it needs to be adjusted to be within the range of the loop, which is from 1 to `n` (inclusive). Therefore, `j` must be at least 1 and at most `n`.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 499, `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `sum` is 1 + (2 * 2 - (2 - 1) * (2 - 1)) * 2 + (3 * 3 - (3 - 1) * (3 - 1)) * 3 + ... + (n * n - (n - 1) * (n - 1)) * n, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four test cases, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is at least 1 and at most `n**
