To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 2 (since the range starts from 2). Since `i` is currently `n + 1`, we need to adjust it to be within the range of the loop. The smallest value `i` can take is 2, which is the starting value of the range.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 499, `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `sum` is 1, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four test cases, `i` is 2, `j` is `n + 1`**
