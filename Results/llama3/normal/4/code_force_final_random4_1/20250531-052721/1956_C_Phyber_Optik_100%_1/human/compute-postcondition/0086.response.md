Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to 0, `n` is an integer that must be at least `n`, `sum` is 1 + ∑((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i) for `i` from 2 to `n`, `_` is `t`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `t` test cases, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n + 1`, and the sum which is equal to 1 + ∑((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i) for `i` from 2 to `n` and the value of `n` plus `n` which is equal to 2 * `n` are printed, and this is printed: 1, `n-j+1`, and the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive, which are the numbers from 1 to `n`, and this is printed: 2, `n-j+1`, and the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive, which are the numbers from 1 to `n`, for each iteration of the loop.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `t` is 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The value of `n` remains the same, and the sum of the squares of the numbers from 2 to `n` is calculated and printed, along with the value of `n` plus `n`. The loop iterates `t` times, and in each iteration, it prints the values 1, `n-j+1`, and the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive, and then prints the values 2, `n-j+1`, and the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
