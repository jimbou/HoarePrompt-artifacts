The `print` statement will print the numbers 2, `n - j + 1`, and the numbers from 1 to `n`.

Here's a breakdown of the values:

*   `2` is a literal integer value.
*   `n - j + 1` is an expression that evaluates to `n - 2`, since `j` is 3. This is because `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, and `j` is 3.
*   `*range(1, n + 1)` is a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), since the `range` function generates numbers from the start value (1) up to but not including the stop value (`n + 1`).

So, the output will be the numbers 2, `n - 2`, and the numbers from 1 to `n`.

Output: **2, n - 2, 1, 2, 3, ..., n**
