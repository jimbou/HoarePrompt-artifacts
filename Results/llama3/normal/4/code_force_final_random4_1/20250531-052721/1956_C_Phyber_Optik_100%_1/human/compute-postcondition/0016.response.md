Output: ** `t` is an integer between 0 and 499, `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `sum` is 1 + ∑((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i) for i from 2 to `n`, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `i` is `n + 1`, the sum which is equal to 1 + ∑((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i) for i from 2 to `n` and the value of `n` plus `n` which is equal to 2 * `n` are printed, `j` is 1, this is printed: 1, `n` minus `j` plus 1 which is equal to `n`, and the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive, which are the numbers from 1 to `n`, and this is printed: 2, `n` minus `j` plus 1 which is equal to `n`, and the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive, which are the numbers from 1 to `n`**
