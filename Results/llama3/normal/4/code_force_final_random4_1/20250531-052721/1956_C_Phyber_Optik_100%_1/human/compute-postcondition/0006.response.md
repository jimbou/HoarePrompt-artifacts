Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 499, `n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `sum` is 1 + (2 * 2 - (2 - 1) * (2 - 1)) * 2 + (3 * 3 - (3 - 1) * (3 - 1)) * 3, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `i` is 3**

The code updates the value of `sum` by adding the result of the expression `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i`, where `i` is 3. The initial value of `sum` is 1 + (2 * 2 - (2 - 1) * (2 - 1)) * 2, which is a constant expression. The updated value of `sum` is the sum of this initial value and the result of the expression `(3 * 3 - (3 - 1) * (3 - 1)) * 3`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
