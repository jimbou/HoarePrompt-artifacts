Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 499, `n` is an integer that must be at least `n`, `sum` is 1 + ∑((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i) for `i` from 2 to `n`, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `i` is `n + 1`, the sum which is equal to 1 + ∑((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i) for `i` from 2 to `n` and the value of `n` plus `n` which is equal to 2 * `n` are printed, and this is printed: 1, 1, and the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive, which are the numbers from 1 to `n`, and this is printed: 2, 1, and the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive, which are the numbers from 1 to `n`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the variable `i` has reached the value of `n + 1`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations from 2 to `n`. The variable `sum` has accumulated the sum of the expression `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` for all `i` from 2 to `n`. The other variables remain unchanged, with `t` still between 1 and 499, `n` still at least `n`, `_` still 1, and `stdin` still containing multiple test cases minus three test cases. The printed output remains the same, with the sum and value of `n` plus `n` printed, followed by the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive printed twice.
