To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 2.

The state of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

The other variables, such as `t`, `sum`, `_`, `stdin`, `i`, and the printed values, are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 499, `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `sum` is 1 + âˆ‘((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i) for i from 2 to `n`, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is 2**
