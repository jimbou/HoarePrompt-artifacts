The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 4, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 4.

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 499, `n` is an integer that must be at least 5, `sum` is 1 + (2 * 2 - (2 - 1) * (2 - 1)) * 2 + (3 * 3 - (3 - 1) * (3 - 1)) * 3, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `i` is 4**
