Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', b is a list of 26 zeros, stdin contains a number of test cases t, where 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, stdin contains a single integer n, where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where 0 <= a_i < n.
Code of the loop:
for t in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    r = ''
    for i in s:
        x = b.index(i)
        r += a[x]
        b[x] += 1
    print(r)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: a is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', b is a list of 26 integers where the value at index x is equal to the number of times x appears in s and all other values are 0, t is greater than 0, n is an integer, s is an empty list, i is the last integer in the original list, r is a string containing a sequence of characters where each character is the x-th letter of the alphabet and the number of times each character appears is equal to the number of times x appears in s, stdin is empty, and r is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: a is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', b is a list of 26 integers where the value at index x is equal to the number of times x appears in s and the value at index x is incremented by the number of times x appears in s, t is greater than 1, n is an integer equal to the first input, s is an empty list, i is the last integer in the original list, r is a string that is equal to the character at index x in a plus the character at index x in a plus the character at index x in a plus ... plus the character at index x in a, where the number of additions is equal to the number of integers in the original list, and the string r is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: a is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', b is a list of 26 integers where the value at index x is equal to the number of times x appears in s plus the number of times x appears in s, t is greater than 2, n is an integer equal to the first input, s is a list of integers that must have at least n integers, i is the last integer in the list, r is a string containing the x-th letter of the alphabet plus the letter at index x in a plus the letter at index x in a plus ... (n times), and r is printed, r is a string that contains a sequence of letters, where each letter is the x-th letter of the alphabet, repeated n times, and the letters are taken from the string a, which is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
