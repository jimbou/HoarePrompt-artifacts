To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `s`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `s`. If `s` has at least 2 integers, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has at least 1 integer, `i` is the first integer in the list.

For the loop to execute again, `s` must have at least 2 integers, and `i` must be the second integer in the list.

State: **`a` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `b` is a list of 26 integers where the value at index x is equal to the number of times x appears in s plus 1 for the first integer i, `t` is greater than 2, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is the second integer in the list, `r` is a string containing the x-th letter of the alphabet, `x` is the index of the second integer i in the list `b`**
