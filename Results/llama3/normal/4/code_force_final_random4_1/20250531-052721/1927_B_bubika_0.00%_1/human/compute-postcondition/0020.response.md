Output State: **a is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', b is a list of 26 integers where the value at index x is equal to the number of times x appears in s and the value at index x is incremented by the number of times x appears in s, t is greater than 1, n is an integer equal to the first input, s is an empty list, i is the last integer in the original list, r is a string that is equal to the character at index x in a plus the character at index x in a plus the character at index x in a plus ... plus the character at index x in a, where the number of additions is equal to the number of integers in the original list.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: 

The string 'a' remains unchanged, the list 'b' now contains the correct count of each integer in the original list 's', the value of 't' is still greater than 1, the value of 'n' is still equal to the first input, the list 's' is now empty because all its elements have been processed, the value of 'i' is the last integer in the original list, and the string 'r' is a concatenation of all the characters at the indices corresponding to the integers in the original list, repeated for each occurrence of the integer in the list.
