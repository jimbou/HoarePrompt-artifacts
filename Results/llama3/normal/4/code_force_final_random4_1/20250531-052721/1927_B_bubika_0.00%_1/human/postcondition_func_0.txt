This function reads a number of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It then generates a string r by mapping each integer to its corresponding alphabet letter (0 -> 'a', 1 -> 'b', ..., 25 -> 'z') and increments a counter for each letter. The function prints the resulting string r for each test case.
