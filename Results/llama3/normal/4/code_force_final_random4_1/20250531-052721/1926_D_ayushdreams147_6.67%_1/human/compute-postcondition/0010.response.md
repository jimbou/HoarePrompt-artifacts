Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of at least 2 non-negative integers, `num` is the second element in the list `a`. If `num` is in `count`, then `count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1]` is 1 more than its original value and `res` is 1 more than its original value. Otherwise, `count[num]` is decreased by 1.***
