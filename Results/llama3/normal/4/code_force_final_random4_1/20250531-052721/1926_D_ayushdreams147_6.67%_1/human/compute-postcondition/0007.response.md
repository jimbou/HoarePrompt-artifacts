To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `num` and `a`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If `a` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` has at least 1 non-negative integer, and `num` is the first element in the list `a`.

For the loop to execute again, `a` must have at least 2 elements, and `num` must be the second element in the list `a`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of at least 2 non-negative integers, `num` is the second element in the list `a`.**
