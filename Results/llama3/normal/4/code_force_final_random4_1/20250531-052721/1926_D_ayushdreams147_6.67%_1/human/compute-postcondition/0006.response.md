Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of at least 1 non-negative integer, `num` is the first element in the list `a`. If `num` is not in the dictionary `count`, then `res` is 1 and `count` is a dictionary with the key `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` and value 1. Otherwise, `res` is 0 and `count` is a dictionary where `num` is a key and its value is decreased by 1.***
