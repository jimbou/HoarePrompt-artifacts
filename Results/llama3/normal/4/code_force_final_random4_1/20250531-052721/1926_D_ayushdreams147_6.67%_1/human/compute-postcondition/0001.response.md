To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `num` and `a`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list `a` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Since `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, we can adjust the state of `a` to have at least 1 element.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of at least 1 non-negative integer, `res` is 0, `count` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first element in the list `a`**
