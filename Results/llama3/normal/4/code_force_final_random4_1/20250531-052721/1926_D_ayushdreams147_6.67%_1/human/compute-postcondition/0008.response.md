Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of at least 2 non-negative integers, num is the second element in the list a, count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1] is 1 more than its original value, res is 1 more than its original value.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line updates the value of `count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1]` by incrementing it by 1. The second line increments the value of `res` by 1. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The value of `num` also remains the same, as it is not updated by the code.
