Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_j < 2^31 for all j, res is 0, count is an empty dictionary
Code of the loop:
for num in a:
    if num not in count:
        count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1] = count.get(num ^ (1 << 31) - 1, 0) + 1
        res += 1
    else:
        count[num] -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of at least 1 non-negative integer, `num` is the first element in the list `a`. If `num` is not in the dictionary `count`, then `res` is 1 and `count` is a dictionary with the key `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` and value 1. Otherwise, `res` is 0 and `count` is a dictionary where `num` is a key and its value is decreased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of at least 2 non-negative integers, `num` is the second element in the list `a`. If `num` is in `count`, then `count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1]` is 1 more than its original value and `res` is 1 more than its original value. Otherwise, `count[num]` is decreased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of at least 3 non-negative integers, `num` is the third element in the list `a`. If `num` is not in `count`, then `count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1]` is 1 more than its original value and `res` is 1 more than its original value. If `num` is in `count`, then `count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1]` is 1 more than its original value and `res` is 1 more than its original value. Otherwise, `count[num]` is decreased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
