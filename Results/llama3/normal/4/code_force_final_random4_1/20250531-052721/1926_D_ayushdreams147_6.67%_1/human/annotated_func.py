#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer and a is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_j < 2^31 for all j.
    res = 0
    count = {}
    for num in a:
        if num not in count:
            count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1] = count.get(num ^ (1 << 31) - 1, 0) + 1
            res += 1
        else:
            count[num] -= 1
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `res` is the number of unique non-negative integers in the original list `a`, and `count` is a dictionary where each key is a unique non-negative integer from the original list `a` and its value is 0.
    return res
    #The program returns the number of unique non-negative integers in the original list `a`, which is 0 since `a` is an empty list.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of non-negative integers as input and returns the number of unique integers in the list. It modifies the input list to empty and creates a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the original list and its value is 0. The function effectively counts the unique non-negative integers in the input list.
