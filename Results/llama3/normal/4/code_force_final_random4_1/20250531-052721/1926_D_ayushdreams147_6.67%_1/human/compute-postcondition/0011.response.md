The only variable in the loop head is variable `num` and list `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `a` has at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element in the list `a`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the `num` is the third element in the list.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of at least 3 non-negative integers, `num` is the third element in the list `a`. If `num` is in `count`, then `count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1]` is 1 more than its original value and `res` is 1 more than its original value. Otherwise, `count[num]` is decreased by 1.**
