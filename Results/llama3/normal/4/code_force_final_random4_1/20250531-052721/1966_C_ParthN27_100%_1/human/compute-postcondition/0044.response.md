Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list of integers, if `n` is equal to the length of `arr` then `s` contains the last element of `arr`, else `s` contains the last element of `arr`, the second last element of `arr` and the element at index `n`, ans is either 0 or 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 1 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to include the element at index `n` from the list `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 1 inputs.
