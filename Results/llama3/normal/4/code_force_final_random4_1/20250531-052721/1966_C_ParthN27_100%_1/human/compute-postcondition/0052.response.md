Postcondition: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a sorted list of integers with an additional 0 at the beginning, `ans` is 1, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus the original length of `arr` inputs. The current value of `s[i] - s[i - 1]` is greater than 1.**
