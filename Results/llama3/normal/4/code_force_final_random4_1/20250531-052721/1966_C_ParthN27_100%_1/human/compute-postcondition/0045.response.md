Output State: **n is equal to the length of arr, i is n, arr is a list of integers, s contains all elements of arr, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus n inputs, ans is either 0 or 1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `n` is equal to the length of the list `arr`, the variable `i` is equal to `n`, the list `arr` remains unchanged, the set `s` contains all elements of the list `arr`, the standard input `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus `n` inputs, and the variable `ans` is either 0 or 1.
