The code `ans ^= 1` performs a bitwise XOR operation between the current value of `ans` (which is 1) and 1. The result of this operation is 0.

Output State: **`n` is the length of `s`, `s` is a sorted list of integers, `s` has an additional element 0 at the beginning, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus the original length of `arr` minus (`n`+2) inputs, and `n` is not equal to 2 and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3. The difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `s` is less than or equal to 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been changed to 0, while all other variables remain the same. The list `s` is still sorted and has an extra 0 at the beginning, and the difference between consecutive elements in `s` is still at most 1. The input stream `stdin` still contains at least one test case minus the original length of `arr` minus (`n`+2) inputs.
