Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is at least 1 and at most `n-2`, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a sorted list of unique integers from `arr` with a 0 prepended to it, `ans` is 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code `break` does not change the values of any variables. However, it causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional statement it is currently inside. Therefore, the values of `n`, `i`, `arr`, `s`, and `ans` remain the same, but the program's control flow is altered.
