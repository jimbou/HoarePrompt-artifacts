To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so we need to increment `i` by 1 to get the new value of `i`. 

Additionally, since `n` is the length of `s`, and `s` has an additional element 0 at the beginning, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3 and not equal to 2.

State: **`n` is the length of `s`, `s` is a sorted list of integers, `s` has an additional element 0 at the beginning, `arr` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus the original length of `arr` minus (`n`+2) inputs, and `n` is not equal to 2 and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is incremented by 1**
