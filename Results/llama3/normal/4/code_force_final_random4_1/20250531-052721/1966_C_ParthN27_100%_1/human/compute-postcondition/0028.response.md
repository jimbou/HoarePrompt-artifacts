Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is `n-1`, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a sorted list of unique integers from `arr` with a 0 prepended to it. If the difference between any two consecutive elements of `s` is greater than 1, `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` is 0.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `n-1`, which is the last index of the loop. The value of `ans` will depend on whether there are any gaps in the sorted list `s` that are greater than 1. If there are no such gaps, `ans` will be 0, indicating that all consecutive elements in `s` are adjacent. If there are gaps, `ans` will be 1, indicating that there are non-adjacent elements in `s`. The values of `arr` and `s` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop.
