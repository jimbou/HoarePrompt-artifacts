Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is at least 2 and at most `n-1`, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a sorted list of unique integers from `arr` with a 0 prepended to it. If the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)th` elements of `s` is greater than 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `ans` is 0. Otherwise, `ans` is 1 and the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)th` elements of `s` is less than or equal to 1.**

Explanation: The code `ans ^= 1` flips the value of `ans`. Initially, if the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)th` elements of `s` is greater than 1, `ans` is 1, and if the difference is less than or equal to 1, `ans` is 0. After the code is executed, the values of `ans` are flipped. Therefore, if the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)th` elements of `s` is greater than 1, `ans` becomes 0, and if the difference is less than or equal to 1, `ans` becomes 1. The values of the other variables remain the same.
