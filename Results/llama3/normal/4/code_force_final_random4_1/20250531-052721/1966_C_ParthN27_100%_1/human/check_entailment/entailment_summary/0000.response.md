Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the provided problem description. The program first removes duplicates from the input list, sorts it, and then checks for consecutive integers. If the list contains only two unique integers, it outputs 'Alice'. Otherwise, it iterates through the list, checking for gaps between consecutive integers. If a gap is found, it outputs 'Bob'. If no gaps are found, it outputs 'Alice' if the number of iterations is odd, and 'Bob' if it's even. This logic is consistent with the problem description and the provided example.

Correctness: **True**
