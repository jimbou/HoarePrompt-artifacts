Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `i` is `n-1`, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a sorted list of unique integers from `arr` with a 0 prepended to it. If the difference between any two consecutive elements of `s` is greater than 1, then `ans` is 1 and 'Alice' is printed. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and 'Bob' is printed.***
