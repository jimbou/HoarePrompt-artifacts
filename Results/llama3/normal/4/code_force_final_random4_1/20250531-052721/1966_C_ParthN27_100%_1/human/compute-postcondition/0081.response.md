Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` contains the first three elements of `arr`, `ans` is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus the original length of arr minus 5 inputs**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to include the third element of `arr` (which is at index `i` = 2), in addition to the first two elements it already contained. The other variables remain unchanged.
