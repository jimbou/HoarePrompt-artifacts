Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` contains at least three integers including the second element of `arr` which is also added to `s`, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 1 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to include the second element of `arr`, which is `arr[i]` where `i` is 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `s` contains at least two integers is still valid, and now it also includes the second element of `arr`. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 1 inputs.
