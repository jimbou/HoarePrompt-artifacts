The code `ans ^= 1` performs a bitwise XOR operation on the variable `ans` with the value 1. This operation flips the least significant bit of `ans`, effectively changing its value from 1 to 0 or vice versa.

Considering the initial state, `ans` is 1. After the XOR operation, `ans` will become 0.

The other variables and conditions in the initial state remain unaffected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a sorted list of integers with an additional 0 at the beginning, `ans` is 0, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus the original length of `arr` inputs, and the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `s` is less than or equal to 1.**
