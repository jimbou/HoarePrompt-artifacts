Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *n is the number of unique integers in arr plus 1, i is n-1, arr is a list of integers, s is a sorted list of unique integers from arr with a 0 prepended to it, ans is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 0 inputs. n is larger than 2
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    if s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1:
        break
    else:
        ans ^= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is at least 3, `i` is at least 1 and at most `n-2`, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a sorted list of unique integers from `arr` with a 0 prepended to it. If the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)th` elements of `s` is greater than 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)th` elements of `s` is less than or equal to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is at least 3, `i` is at least 2 and at most `n-1`, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a sorted list of unique integers from `arr` with a 0 prepended to it. If the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)th` elements of `s` is greater than 1, `ans` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)th` elements of `s` is less than or equal to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is at least 4, `i` is at least 3 and at most `n-1`, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a sorted list of unique integers from `arr` with a 0 prepended to it. If the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)th` elements of `s` is greater than 1, `ans` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)th` elements of `s` is less than or equal to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
