Output State: **`n` is the length of `s`, `s` is a sorted list of integers, `s` has an additional element 0 at the beginning, `arr` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus the original length of `arr` minus (`n`+2) inputs, and `n` is not equal to 2 and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is incremented by 1, `ans` is the bitwise XOR of its previous value and 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The length of the list `s` is still `n`, and `s` remains a sorted list of integers with an additional element 0 at the beginning. The list `arr` is unchanged. The number of inputs in `stdin` is reduced by the original length of `arr` plus `n`+2. The value of `n` is still greater than or equal to 3 and not equal to 2. The value of `i` has been incremented by 1. The value of `ans` has been updated by performing a bitwise XOR operation with 1, which means its value has been toggled (i.e., 0 becomes 1 and 1 becomes 0).
