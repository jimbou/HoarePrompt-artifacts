Postcondition: ***n is the length of s, i is the original length of arr, arr is a list of integers, s is a sorted list of integers with an additional 0 at the beginning, ans is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus the original length of arr inputs. If n is 2, 'Alice' is being printed. If n is greater than or equal to 3, i is n - 1, the difference between the element at index i and the element at index i-1 in s is not greater than 1. If ans is 1, 'Alice' is being printed. Otherwise, 'Bob' is being printed.***
