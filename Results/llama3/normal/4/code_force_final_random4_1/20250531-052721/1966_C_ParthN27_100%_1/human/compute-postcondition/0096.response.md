Output State: **`n` is the length of `s`, `s` is a sorted list of integers, `s` has an additional element 0 at the beginning, `arr` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus the original length of `arr` minus (`n`+2) inputs, and `n` is not equal to 2 and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3. If the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `s` is greater than 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement and `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is toggled (i.e., 0 becomes 1 and 1 becomes 0).**

In natural language, the output state is: The length of `s` is still `n`, and `s` is still a sorted list of integers with an extra 0 at the beginning. The list `arr` remains unchanged. The number of test cases in `stdin` is still at least 1, minus the original length of `arr`, minus (`n`+2) inputs. The value of `n` is still greater than or equal to 3 and not equal to 2. The value of `ans` is toggled, meaning if it was 0, it becomes 1, and if it was 1, it becomes 0. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The program may have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement if the difference between two consecutive elements in `s` is greater than 1.
