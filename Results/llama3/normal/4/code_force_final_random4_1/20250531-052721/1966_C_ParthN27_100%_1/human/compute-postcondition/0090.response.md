Output State: **`n` is the length of `s`, `s` is a sorted list of integers, `s` has an additional element 0 at the beginning, `ans` is 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus the original length of `arr` minus (`n`+2) inputs, and `n` is not equal to 2 and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3. The current value of `i` is 1 and the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `s` is greater than 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `n`, `s`, `ans`, `i`, `arr`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
