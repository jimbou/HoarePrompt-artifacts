Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a sorted list of integers with an additional 0 at the beginning, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus the original length of `arr` inputs. If the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `s` is greater than 1, `ans` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `s` is less than or equal to 1.***
