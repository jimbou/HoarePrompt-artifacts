Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is an empty set, i is n-1, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, ans is either 0 or 1. If n is 2, 'Alice' was printed. If n is at least 3, then if the difference between any two consecutive elements of s is greater than 1, then 'Alice' was printed and ans is 1. Otherwise, 'Bob' was printed and ans is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    s.add(arr[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is at least 1, `i` is `n-1`, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a set containing the last element of `arr`, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, ans is either 0 or 1

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is at least 2, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list of integers, if `n` is equal to the length of `arr` then `s` contains the last element of `arr`, else `s` contains the last element of `arr` and the second last element of `arr`, ans is either 0 or 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is at least 3, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list of integers, if `n` is equal to the length of `arr` then `s` contains the last element of `arr`, else `s` contains the last element of `arr`, the second last element of `arr` and the element at index `n`, ans is either 0 or 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 1 inputs.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
