The code adds the element at index `i` of the list `arr` to the set `s`. Since `i` is `n-1`, the last element of the list `arr` is added to the set `s`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is `n-1`, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a set containing the last element of `arr`, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, ans is either 0 or 1**
