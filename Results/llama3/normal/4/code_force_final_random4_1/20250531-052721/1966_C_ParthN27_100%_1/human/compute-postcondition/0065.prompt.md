Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *n is the length of s, i is the original length of arr, arr is a list of integers, s is a sorted list of integers with an additional 0 at the beginning, ans is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus the original length of arr inputs. n is not equal to 2
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    if s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1:
        break
    else:
        ans ^= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a sorted list of integers with an additional 0 at the beginning, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus the original length of `arr` inputs. If the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `s` is greater than 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `s` is less than or equal to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a sorted list of integers with an additional 0 at the beginning, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus the original length of `arr` inputs. If the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `s` is greater than 1, `ans` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `s` is less than or equal to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a sorted list of integers with an additional 0 at the beginning, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus the original length of `arr` inputs. If the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `s` is greater than 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `ans` is 1. Otherwise, we do not break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `ans` is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
