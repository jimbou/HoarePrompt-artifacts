Postcondition: **`n` is the length of `s`, `s` is a sorted list of integers, `s` has an additional element 0 at the beginning, `arr` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus the original length of `arr` minus (`n`+2) inputs, and `n` is not equal to 2 and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3. If the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `s` is greater than 1, `ans` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is toggled (i.e., 0 becomes 1 and 1 becomes 0), and `i` is incremented by 1.**
