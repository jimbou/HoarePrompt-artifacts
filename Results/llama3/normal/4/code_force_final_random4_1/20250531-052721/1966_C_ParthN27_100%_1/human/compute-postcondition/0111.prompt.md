Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 2*10^5) and then n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = set()
    for i in range(n):
        s.add(arr[i])
    s = list(s)
    s.sort()
    s = [0] + s
    ans = 1
    n = len(s)
    if n == 2:
        print('Alice')
    else:
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1:
                break
            else:
                ans ^= 1
        if ans:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is the number of unique integers in arr plus 1, i is n-1, arr is a list of integers, s is a sorted list of unique integers from arr with a 0 prepended to it, ans is either 0 or 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 0 inputs. If n is 2, 'Alice' is printed. If n is at least 3, then if the difference between any two consecutive elements of s is greater than 1, then 'Alice' is printed and ans is 1. Otherwise, 'Bob' is printed and ans is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is the length of s, i is the original length of arr, arr is a list of integers, s is a sorted list of integers with an additional 0 at the beginning, ans is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus the original length of arr inputs. If n is 2, 'Alice' is being printed. If n is greater than or equal to 3, i is n - 1, the difference between the element at index i and the element at index i-1 in s is not greater than 1. If ans is 1, 'Alice' is being printed. Otherwise, 'Bob' is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is the length of s, s is a sorted list of integers, s has an additional element 0 at the beginning, ans is 1, i is greater than or equal to 0, arr is a list of integers, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus the original length of arr minus (n+2) inputs. If n is 2, 'Alice' is printed. If n is not equal to 2 and n is greater than or equal to 3, i is equal to n-1. If the difference between consecutive elements in s is greater than 1, the program has broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if the bitwise XOR of the previous value of ans and 1 is non-zero, 'Alice' is printed. If the bitwise XOR of the previous value of ans and 1 is zero, 'Bob' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
