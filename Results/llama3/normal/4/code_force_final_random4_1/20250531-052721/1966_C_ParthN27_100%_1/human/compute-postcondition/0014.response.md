To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 3, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`. Since `i` is `n-1` before the loop, it needs to be adjusted to be within the range of the loop, which is between 1 and `n-2` (inclusive). Also, since `n` is larger than 2, we can infer that `i` is at least 1.

State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is at least 1 and at most `n-2`, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a sorted list of unique integers from `arr` with a 0 prepended to it, `ans` is 1, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 0 inputs**
