Postcondition: ***`n` is the length of `s`, `s` is a sorted list of integers, `s` has an additional element 0 at the beginning, `arr` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus the original length of `arr` minus (`n`+2) inputs, and `n` is not equal to 2 and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is equal to `n-1`. The difference between consecutive elements in `s` is not greater than 1. `ans` is 0.***
