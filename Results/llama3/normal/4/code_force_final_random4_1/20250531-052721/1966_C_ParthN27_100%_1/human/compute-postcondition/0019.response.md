Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `i` is at least 1 and at most `n-2`, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a sorted list of unique integers from `arr` with a 0 prepended to it. If the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)th` elements of `s` is greater than 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)th` elements of `s` is less than or equal to 1.***
