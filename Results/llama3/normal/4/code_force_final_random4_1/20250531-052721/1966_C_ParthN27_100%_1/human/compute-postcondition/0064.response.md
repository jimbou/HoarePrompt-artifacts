Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a sorted list of integers with an additional 0 at the beginning, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus the original length of `arr` inputs. If the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `s` is greater than 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `ans` is 1. Otherwise, we do not break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `ans` is 0.***
