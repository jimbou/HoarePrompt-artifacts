Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is at least 1 and at most `n-2`, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a sorted list of unique integers from `arr` with a 0 prepended to it, `ans` is 0, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 0 inputs, and the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)th` elements of `s` is less than or equal to 1**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to 0 by performing an XOR operation with 1. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial conditions. The state of `stdin` also remains the same, containing at least 1 test case minus 0 inputs.
