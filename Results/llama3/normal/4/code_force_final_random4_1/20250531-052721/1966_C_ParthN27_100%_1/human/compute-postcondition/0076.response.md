According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is an integer does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is an empty set, `ans` is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus the original length of arr minus 2 inputs**
