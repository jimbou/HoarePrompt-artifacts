Postcondition: ***n is the number of unique integers in arr plus 1, i is n-1, arr is a list of integers, s is a sorted list of unique integers from arr with a 0 prepended to it, ans is either 0 or 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 0 inputs. If n is 2, 'Alice' is printed. If n is at least 3, then if the difference between any two consecutive elements of s is greater than 1, then 'Alice' is printed and ans is 1. Otherwise, 'Bob' is printed and ans is 0.***
