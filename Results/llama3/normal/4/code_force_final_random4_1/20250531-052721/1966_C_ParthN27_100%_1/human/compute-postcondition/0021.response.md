Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is at least 2 and at most `n-1`, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a sorted list of unique integers from `arr` with a 0 prepended to it, `ans` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `i`, `arr`, and `s` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `ans` is now 1, indicating that the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)th` elements of `s` is greater than 1. Additionally, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
