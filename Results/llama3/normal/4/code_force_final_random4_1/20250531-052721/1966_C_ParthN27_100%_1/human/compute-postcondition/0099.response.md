Output State: **`n` is the length of `s`, `s` is a sorted list of integers, `s` has an additional element 0 at the beginning, `arr` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus the original length of `arr` minus (`n`+1) inputs, and `n` is not equal to 2 and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The length of the list `s` is still `n`, and `s` remains a sorted list of integers with an additional element 0 at the beginning. The list `arr` also remains unchanged. The number of inputs in `stdin` has decreased by 1. The value of `n` is still greater than or equal to 3 and not equal to 2. The value of `i` has been incremented by 1. We have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement.
