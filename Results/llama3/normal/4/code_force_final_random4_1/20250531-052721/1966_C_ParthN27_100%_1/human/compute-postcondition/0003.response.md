Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` contains at least one integer which is the first element of `arr`, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `n` and `i` remains the same as in the initial state. The list `arr` also remains unchanged. However, the set `s` now contains at least one integer, which is the first element of the list `arr`. The `stdin` still contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, as no input operation was performed in the given code.
