Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` contains the first element of `arr`, `ans` is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus the original length of arr minus 3 inputs**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to include the first element of the list `arr`, which is `arr[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus the original length of arr minus 3 inputs, as no input has been consumed by the code.
