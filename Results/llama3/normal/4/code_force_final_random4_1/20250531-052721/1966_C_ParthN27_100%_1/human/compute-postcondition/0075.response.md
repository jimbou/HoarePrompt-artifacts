Output State: **n is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is an empty set, ans is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus the original length of arr minus 2 inputs**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. The second line assigns a list of integers from stdin to `arr`. The third line creates an empty set and assigns it to `s`. The value of `ans` remains unchanged as 1. Stdin now contains at least 1 test case minus the original length of `arr` minus 2 inputs.
