The code adds the element at index `i` of `arr` to the set `s`. Since `i` is equal to `n`, which is at least 2, the element added to `s` is the last element of `arr` or the second last element of `arr` if `n` is greater than the length of `arr`. However, since `s` already contains the last element of `arr`, if `n` is equal to the length of `arr`, then `s` will still contain only the last element of `arr`. But if `n` is greater than the length of `arr`, then `s` will contain the last element of `arr` and the second last element of `arr`. The values of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list of integers, if `n` is equal to the length of `arr` then `s` contains the last element of `arr`, else `s` contains the last element of `arr` and the second last element of `arr`, ans is either 0 or 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.**
