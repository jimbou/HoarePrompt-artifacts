Postcondition: ***n is the length of s, s is a sorted list of integers, s has an additional element 0 at the beginning, ans is 1, i is greater than or equal to 0, arr is a list of integers, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus the original length of arr minus (n+2) inputs. If n is 2, 'Alice' is printed. If n is not equal to 2 and n is greater than or equal to 3, i is equal to n-1. If the difference between consecutive elements in s is greater than 1, the program has broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if the bitwise XOR of the previous value of ans and 1 is non-zero, 'Alice' is printed. If the bitwise XOR of the previous value of ans and 1 is zero, 'Bob' is printed.***
