Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n-1`, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` contains all unique integers from `arr`, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 0 inputs.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be one less than the initial value of `n`, the set `s` will contain all unique integers from the list `arr`, and the state of the other variables remains unchanged.
