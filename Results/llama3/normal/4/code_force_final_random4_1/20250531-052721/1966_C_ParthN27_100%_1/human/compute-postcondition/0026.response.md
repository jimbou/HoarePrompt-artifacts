Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is at least 3 and at most `n-1`, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a sorted list of unique integers from `arr` with a 0 prepended to it. If the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)th` elements of `s` is greater than 1, `ans` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is 1 and the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)th` elements of `s` is less than or equal to 1.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been toggled, i.e., if it was 0, it becomes 1, and if it was 1, it becomes 0. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for breaking out of the loop or if statement is also updated accordingly.
