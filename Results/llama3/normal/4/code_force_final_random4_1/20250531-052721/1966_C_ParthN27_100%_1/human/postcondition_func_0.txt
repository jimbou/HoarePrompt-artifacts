Determines the winner of a game based on a list of integers. The function accepts a list of integers as input, removes duplicates, sorts the list, and then checks for consecutive integers. If the list contains only two unique integers, the function outputs 'Alice'. Otherwise, it iterates through the list, checking for gaps between consecutive integers. If a gap is found, the function outputs 'Bob'. If no gaps are found, the function outputs 'Alice' if the number of iterations is odd, and 'Bob' if it's even. The function processes multiple test cases from standard input.
