The code adds the second element of `arr` to `s`. Since `i` is 1, `arr[i]` refers to the second element of `arr`. The values of `n` and `stdin` are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` contains at least two integers including the second element of `arr`, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 1 inputs.**
