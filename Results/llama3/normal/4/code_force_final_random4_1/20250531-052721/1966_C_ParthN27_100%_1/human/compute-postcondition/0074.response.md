To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states accordingly.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable in the loop head is the loop variable `_`, which is not used in the loop body. The loop condition depends on the `range` object, which is created from the `int(input())` expression.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:

* `n` is the length of `s`
* `i` is the original length of `arr`
* `arr` is a list of integers
* `s` is a sorted list of integers with an additional 0 at the beginning
* `ans` is 1
* `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus the original length of `arr` inputs

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the `range` object. The `range` object is created from the `int(input())` expression, which reads an integer from the standard input.

For the loop to execute one more time, the `range` object must have at least one more element. This means that the `int(input())` expression must return a value that is at least 1 more than the current value of `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

* `n` is the length of `s` plus 1
* `i` is still the original length of `arr`
* `arr` is still a list of integers
* `s` is still a sorted list of integers with an additional 0 at the beginning
* `ans` is still 1
* `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus the original length of `arr` inputs

Note that the state of `i` and `arr` does not change, as they are not related to the loop head. The state of `s` also does not change, as it is not related to the loop head. The state of `ans` does not change, as it is not related to the loop head.

State: **`n` is the length of `s` plus 1, `i` is the original length of `arr`, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a sorted list of integers with an additional 0 at the beginning, `ans` is 1, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus the original length of `arr` inputs**
