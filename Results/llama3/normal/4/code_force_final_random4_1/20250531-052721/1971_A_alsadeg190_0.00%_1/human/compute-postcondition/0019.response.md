Based on the initial state, `x` and `y` are integers between 1 and 9. The print statement simply prints the values of `x` and `y`.

Since the exact values of `x` and `y` are not specified, we can't determine the exact output. However, we can describe the output as the values of `x` and `y`, which are integers between 1 and 9.

Output: **x (an integer between 1 and 9), y (an integer between 1 and 9)**
