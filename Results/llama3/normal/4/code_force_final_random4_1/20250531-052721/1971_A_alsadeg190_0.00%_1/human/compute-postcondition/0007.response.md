Based on the precondition, the values of `x` and `y` are integers between 0 and 9, and `x` is less than or equal to `y`. The `print` statement is executed without any additional operations or modifications to the values of `x` and `y`.

Therefore, the output will be the values of `y` and `x` as they are, without any changes.

Output: **y (an integer between 0 and 9), x (an integer between 0 and 9, where x is less than or equal to y)**
