Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input values of x and y are equal. In such cases, the program prints the values in the order they are input, rather than printing the minimum followed by the maximum. For example, if the input is "3 3", the program will print "3 3" instead of the correct output "3 3". 

However, the problem description requires the program to output the minimum of x and y followed by the maximum of x and y. In the case of equal inputs, the minimum and maximum are the same, so the program should print the same value twice. 

To fix this issue, the program should be modified to always print the minimum value first, followed by the maximum value, regardless of their order in the input. This can be achieved by using the built-in min and max functions in Python. 

Here is the corrected code:

```
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(min(x, y), max(x, y))
```

This corrected code will work correctly for all possible inputs, including cases where x and y are equal.
