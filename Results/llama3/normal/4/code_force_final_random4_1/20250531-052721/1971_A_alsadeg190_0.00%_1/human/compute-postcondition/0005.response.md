Output: **`x` is an integer between 0 and 9, `y` is an integer between 0 and 9, `i` is 0, stdin contains x-1 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9). The current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `y`, and the current values of `x` and `y` are being printed, which are integers between 0 and 9, and the current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `y`.**
