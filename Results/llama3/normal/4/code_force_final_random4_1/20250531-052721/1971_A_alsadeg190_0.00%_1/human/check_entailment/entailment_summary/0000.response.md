Reasoning:

The program is designed to read a specified number of pairs of integers, sort each pair in non-decreasing order, and print the sorted pairs. The program correctly implements this logic by comparing the two integers in each pair and printing them in the correct order.

However, the problem statement requires the program to output the minimum of x and y followed by the maximum of x and y. The program's logic is actually opposite of this, as it prints the maximum followed by the minimum when x is greater than y.

Correctness: **False**
