Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the minimum and maximum of two given integers x and y.
2. The program defines a function `func()` that takes no arguments.
3. Inside the function, it reads an integer `x` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
4. The function then iterates `x` times, reading two integers `x` and `y` from the input in each iteration.
5. For each pair of `x` and `y`, the function checks if `x` is greater than `y`. If true, it prints `x` and `y` in that order. Otherwise, it prints `y` and `x` in that order.
6. The function does not return any value.

Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the required logic to find the minimum and maximum of two integers. It reads the correct number of test cases, reads the input pairs correctly, and prints the minimum and maximum values in the correct order. The use of a simple if-else statement to determine the order of printing is also correct.
