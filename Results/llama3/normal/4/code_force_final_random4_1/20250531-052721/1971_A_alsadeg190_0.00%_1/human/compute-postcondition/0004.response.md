The code prints the current values of `x` and `y`. Since `x` is an integer between 0 and 9, and `y` is an integer between 0 and 9, and the current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `y`, the print statement will output the current values of `x` and `y` that satisfy this condition.
Output: **x (where x is an integer between 0 and 9 and greater than y), y (where y is an integer between 0 and 9 and less than x)**
