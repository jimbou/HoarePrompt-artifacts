Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of outputting the minimum and maximum of two integers x and y for a specified number of test cases. The program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads two integers x and y, and prints the minimum and maximum of the two integers.

The program uses a simple if-else statement to determine which integer is greater and prints them in the correct order. The program also correctly handles the case where x and y are equal, as it prints them in the same order.

The program's logic is correct, and it produces the expected output for the given example inputs. The program also consumes all input and leaves the input stream empty, as stated in the overall description of the function.

Correctness: **True**
