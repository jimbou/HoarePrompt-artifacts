The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `x` is an integer between 1 and 9. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `x` must be greater than 2.
State: **`x` and `y` are integers between 1 and 9, `i` is 2, stdin contains x-2 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (1 <= x, y <= 9). If `x` is greater than `y`, then the values of `x` and `y` are printed. Otherwise, the values of `y` and `x` are printed.**
