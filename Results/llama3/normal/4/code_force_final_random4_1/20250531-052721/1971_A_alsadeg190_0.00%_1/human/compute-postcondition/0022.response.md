Output: **`x` and `y` are integers between 1 and 9, `i` is 2, stdin contains x-3 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (1 <= x, y <= 9). If `x` is greater than `y`, then the values of `x` and `y` are printed. Otherwise, the values of `y` and `x` are printed, and the values of `y` and `x` are being printed**
