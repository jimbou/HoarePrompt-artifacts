Output State: **n is an integer, f is an integer minus one, k is an integer minus one, a is a sorted list of integers in descending order, x is an integer equal to the value of a at index f before sorting, _ is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.**

The code block reads two lines of input from stdin. The first line contains three integers, which are assigned to `n`, `f`, and `k`. The second line contains a list of integers, which are assigned to `a`. The value of `f` is decremented by 1, and the value of `k` is also decremented by 1. The list `a` is sorted in descending order. The value of `x` is set to the value of `a` at index `f` before sorting. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0. After the code executes, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.
