Output: **n is an integer, f is an integer minus one, k is an integer minus one, a is a sorted list of integers in descending order, x is an integer equal to the value of a at index f before sorting, _ is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. The value of a at index k is greater than or equal to x, and this is printed: 'YES' if k is equal to n - 1 or the value of a at index k + 1 is less than x, otherwise 'MAYBE'**
