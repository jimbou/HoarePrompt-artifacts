The code prints 'YES' if k is equal to n - 1 or the value of a at index k + 1 is less than x, otherwise it prints 'MAYBE'. Where n is an integer, f is an integer, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers in descending order, and x is an integer equal to the value of a at index f after sorting.
Output: **n is an integer, f is an integer, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers in descending order, x is an integer equal to the value of a at index f after sorting, _ is 2, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, and either 'YES' or 'MAYBE' is printed based on the conditions k == n - 1 or a[k + 1] < x**
