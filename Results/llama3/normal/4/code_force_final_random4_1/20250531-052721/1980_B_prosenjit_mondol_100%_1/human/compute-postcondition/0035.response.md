Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: t (the number of elements), f (an index), and k (another index). The second line contains t integers. The function sorts these integers in descending order, compares the value at index k with the value at index f, and prints 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' based on this comparison. If the value at index k is greater than the value at index f, it prints 'NO'. If the value at index k is less than the value at index f, it prints 'YES'. If the values are equal and k is not the last index, it prints 'YES' if the next value is less than the value at index f, otherwise it prints 'MAYBE'. The function processes all test cases and empties the standard input.**
