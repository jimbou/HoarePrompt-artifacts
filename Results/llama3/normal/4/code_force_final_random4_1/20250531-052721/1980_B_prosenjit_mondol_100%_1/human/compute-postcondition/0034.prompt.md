Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains three integers t, f, and k (1 <= t, f, k <= 100). The second line contains t integers a_i (1 <= a_i <= 100).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
    f -= 1
    k -= 1
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    x = a[f]
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    if a[k] > x:
        print('NO')
    elif a[k] < x:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('YES' if k == n - 1 or a[k + 1] < x else 'MAYBE')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer, f is an integer minus one, k is an integer minus one, a is a sorted list of integers in descending order, x is an integer equal to the value of a at index f before sorting, _ is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. If the current value of a at index k is greater than the current value of x, 'NO' is printed. If the current value of a at index k is less than x, 'YES' is printed. If the current value of a at index k is greater than or equal to x, 'YES' is printed if k is equal to n - 1 or the value of a at index k + 1 is less than x, otherwise 'MAYBE' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer, f is an integer minus one, k is an integer minus one, a is a sorted list of integers in descending order, x is an integer equal to the value of a at index f before sorting, _ is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. If a[k] is greater than x, 'NO' is printed. If a[k] is less than x, 'YES' is printed. If a[k] is equal to x, either 'YES' or 'MAYBE' is printed depending on whether k is equal to n - 1 or a[k + 1] is less than x.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer, f is an integer, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers in descending order, x is an integer equal to the value of a at index f after sorting, _ is 2, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. If a[k] is greater than x, 'NO' is printed. If a[k] is less than x, 'YES' is printed. If a[k] is not less than x and k is not the last index of a, either 'YES' or 'MAYBE' is printed based on the condition a[k + 1] < x.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
