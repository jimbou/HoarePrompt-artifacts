The code prints 'YES' if k is equal to n minus 1 or the value of a at index k plus 1 is less than x, otherwise it prints 'MAYBE'. Where k is an integer minus 1, n is an integer, x is an integer equal to the value of a at index f before sorting, and a is a sorted list of integers in descending order.
Output: **YES if k is equal to n minus 1 or the value of a at index k plus 1 is less than x, otherwise MAYBE**
