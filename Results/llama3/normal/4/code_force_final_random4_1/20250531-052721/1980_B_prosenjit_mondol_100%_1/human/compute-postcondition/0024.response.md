The only variable in the loop head is variable _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than the number of test cases, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. So for the loop to be executed one more time _ must be 2 and stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 1 inputs.
State: **n is an integer, f is an integer minus one, k is an integer minus one, a is a sorted list of integers in descending order, x is an integer equal to the value of a at index f before sorting, _ is 2, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 1 inputs**
