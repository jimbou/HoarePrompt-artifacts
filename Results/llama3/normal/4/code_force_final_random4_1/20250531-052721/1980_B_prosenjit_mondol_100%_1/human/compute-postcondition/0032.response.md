Postcondition: ***n is an integer, f is an integer, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers in descending order, x is an integer equal to the value of a at index f after sorting, _ is 2, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. If a[k] is less than x, 'YES' is printed. If a[k] is not less than x, either 'YES' or 'MAYBE' is printed based on the conditions k == n - 1 or a[k + 1] < x.***
