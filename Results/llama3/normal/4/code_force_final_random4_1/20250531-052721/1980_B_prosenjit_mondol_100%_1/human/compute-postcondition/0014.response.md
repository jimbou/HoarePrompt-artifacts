The only variable in the loop head is variable _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than the value returned by int(input()), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 0, int(input()) is at least 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time _ is 1 and int(input()) is at least 2.
State: **n is an integer, f is an integer minus one, k is an integer minus one, a is a sorted list of integers in descending order, x is an integer equal to the value of a at index f before sorting, _ is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 1 inputs. If the current value of a at index k is greater than the current value of x, 'NO' is printed. If the current value of a at index k is less than x, 'YES' is printed. If the current value of a at index k is greater than or equal to x, 'YES' is printed if k is equal to n - 1 or the value of a at index k + 1 is less than x, otherwise 'MAYBE' is printed.**
