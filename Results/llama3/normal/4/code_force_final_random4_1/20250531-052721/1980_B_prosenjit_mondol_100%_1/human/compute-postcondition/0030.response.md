Based on the initial state, we can analyze the print statement as follows:

* `k` is an integer, and `n` is also an integer. The condition `k == n - 1` checks if `k` is equal to `n` minus 1.
* `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, and `x` is an integer equal to the value of `a` at index `f` after sorting. This means that `x` is the `f`-th largest element in the list `a`.
* The expression `a[k + 1] < x` checks if the element at index `k + 1` in the list `a` is less than `x`.

Now, let's consider the possible cases:

1. If `k` is equal to `n - 1`, then the condition `k == n - 1` is true, and the print statement will print `'YES'`.
2. If `k` is not equal to `n - 1`, then the condition `a[k + 1] < x` is evaluated. If this condition is true, it means that the element at index `k + 1` in the list `a` is less than the `f`-th largest element `x`. In this case, the print statement will print `'MAYBE'`.
3. If `k` is not equal to `n - 1` and the condition `a[k + 1] < x` is false, it means that the element at index `k + 1` in the list `a` is not less than the `f`-th largest element `x`. In this case, the print statement will also print `'MAYBE'`.

Therefore, the print statement will print either `'YES'` or `'MAYBE'`, depending on the values of `k`, `n`, `a`, and `x`.

Output: **'YES' if k is equal to n - 1, otherwise 'MAYBE'**
