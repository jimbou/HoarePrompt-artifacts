Postcondition: ***n is an integer, f is an integer minus one, k is an integer minus one, a is a sorted list of integers in descending order, x is an integer equal to the value of a at index f before sorting, _ is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. If a[k] is less than x, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, either 'YES' or 'MAYBE' is printed depending on whether k is equal to n - 1 or a[k + 1] is less than x.***
