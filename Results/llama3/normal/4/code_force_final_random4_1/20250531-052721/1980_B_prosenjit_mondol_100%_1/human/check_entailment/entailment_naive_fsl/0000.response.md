Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the favorite cube's value is equal to the value of the cube at the k-th position after sorting, and there are other cubes with the same value that are not removed. In this case, the program will print "YES" if k is not equal to n-1 or if the next cube's value is less than the favorite cube's value. However, it should print "MAYBE" because the favorite cube may or may not be removed depending on its position among the cubes with the same value.

For example, if the input is:

5 2 2
4 3 3 2 3

The program will print "YES", but the correct answer is "MAYBE" because the favorite cube (with value 3) may or may not be removed depending on its position among the three cubes with value 3.
