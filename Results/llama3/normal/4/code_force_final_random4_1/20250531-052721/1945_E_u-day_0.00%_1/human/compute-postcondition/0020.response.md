The variables in the loop head are low and high, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables low and high. If low + 1 is less than high, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, low is updated based on the comparison of arr[mid] and k, and high is updated based on the comparison of arr[mid] and k. To ensure the loop can execute again, low + 1 must be less than high. Since low and high are updated based on the comparison of arr[mid] and k, we need to adjust the state of mid. mid is the integer part of the average of low and high. To ensure low + 1 is less than high, mid must be greater than low and less than high - 1. Also, since mid is the integer part of the average of low and high, low must be less than high - 1.

State: **n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, and k is an element in arr, pos is the index of k in arr, i is equal to n, low is less than high - 1, high is updated based on the comparison of arr[mid] and k, mid is greater than low and less than high - 1, st is a set containing mid.**
