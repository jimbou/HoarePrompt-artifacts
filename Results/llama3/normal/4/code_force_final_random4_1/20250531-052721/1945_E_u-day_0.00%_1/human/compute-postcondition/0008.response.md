To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is some value and `n` is a positive integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `n` remains a positive integer greater than 0
* `k` remains a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n
* `arr` remains a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, and `k` is an element in `arr`
* `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now `i + 1`
* `pos` remains unchanged, as it is not an object in the loop head

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `arr` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, and `k` is an element in `arr`, `i` is `i + 1`, `pos` is unchanged**
