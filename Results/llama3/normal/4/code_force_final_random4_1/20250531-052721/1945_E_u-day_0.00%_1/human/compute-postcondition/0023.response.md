Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `arr` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, and `k` is an element in `arr`, `pos` is the index of `k` in `arr`, `i` is equal to `n`, `low` is equal to `mid`, `high` is updated based on the comparison of `arr[mid]` and `k`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `st` is a set containing `mid` and the previous value of `mid`.**

In this output state, the value of `low` has been updated to be equal to `mid`, which is the result of the comparison between `arr[mid]` and `k`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the set `st` still contains the current value of `mid` and its previous value.
