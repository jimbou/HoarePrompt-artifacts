Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `arr` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, and k is an element in arr, `pos` is the index of k in arr, `i` is equal to n, `low` is less than `mid`, `high` is equal to `mid`, `mid` is equal to `(low + mid) // 2`, `st` is a set containing `mid` and the previous value of `mid`.**

In this output state, the value of `high` has been updated to be equal to `mid`, which is the result of the comparison of `arr[mid]` and `k`. The other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `low` and `mid` is still valid, and `st` still contains the current and previous values of `mid`.
