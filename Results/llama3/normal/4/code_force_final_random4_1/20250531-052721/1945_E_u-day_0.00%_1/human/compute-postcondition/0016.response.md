Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, and k is an element in arr, pos is the index of k in arr, i is equal to n, low is 0, high is the integer part of the average of 0 and n - 1, mid is the integer part of the average of 0 and the integer part of the average of 0 and n - 1, st is a set containing the integer part of the average of 0 and the integer part of the average of 0 and n - 1. The current value of arr[the integer part of the average of 0 and the integer part of the average of 0 and n - 1] is greater than k.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of high has been updated to be the integer part of the average of low and high, which is the integer part of the average of 0 and n - 1. The value of mid is also updated to be the integer part of the average of low and high, which is the integer part of the average of 0 and the integer part of the average of 0 and n - 1. The set st still contains the updated mid value. The current value of arr at the updated mid index is still greater than k. All other variables remain unchanged.
