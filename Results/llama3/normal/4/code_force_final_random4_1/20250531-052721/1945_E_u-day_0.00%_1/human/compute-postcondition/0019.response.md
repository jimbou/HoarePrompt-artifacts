Postcondition: **n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, and k is an element in arr, pos is the index of k in arr, i is equal to n, low and high are updated based on the comparison of arr[mid] and k, mid is the integer part of the average of low and high, st is a set containing mid. If arr[mid] is greater than k, low is updated to 0 and high is updated to the integer part of the average of 0 and n - 1. Otherwise, low is updated to mid and high is updated to n - 1.**
