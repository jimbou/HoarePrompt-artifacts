Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `arr` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, and k is an element in arr, `pos` is the index of k in arr, `i` is equal to n, `low` is equal to mid, `high` is n - 1, `mid` is the integer part of the average of low and high, `st` is a set containing mid. The element at index mid in arr is less than or equal to k.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `low` has been updated to be equal to `mid`, which is the integer part of the average of the previous `low` and `high`. All other variables remain unchanged. The list `arr` still contains distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, with `k` being an element in `arr` at index `pos`. The value of `i` is still equal to `n`, and the set `st` still contains `mid`. The element at index `mid` in `arr` is still less than or equal to `k`.
