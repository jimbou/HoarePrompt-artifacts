Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, and k is an element in arr, pos is the index of k in arr, i is equal to n, low is less than high - 1, high is updated based on the comparison of arr[mid] and k, mid is equal to (low + high) // 2, st is a set containing mid and the previous value of mid.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line calculates the value of `mid` as the average of `low` and `high`, rounded down to the nearest integer. The second line adds the newly calculated `mid` to the set `st`. 

The value of `mid` is updated to be the average of `low` and `high`. The set `st` now contains the new value of `mid` in addition to its previous value. No other variables are affected by the code snippet.
