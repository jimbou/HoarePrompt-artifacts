Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer greater than 0, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, and k is an element in arr, pos is the index of k in arr, i is equal to n, low is 0, high is n - 1, st is an empty set.
Code of the loop:
while low + 1 < high:
    mid = (low + high) // 2
    st.add(mid)
    if arr[mid] > k:
        high = mid
    else:
        low = mid


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, and k is an element in arr, pos is the index of k in arr, i is equal to n, low and high are updated based on the comparison of arr[mid] and k, mid is the integer part of the average of low and high, st is a set containing mid. If arr[mid] is greater than k, low is updated to 0 and high is updated to the integer part of the average of 0 and n - 1. Otherwise, low is updated to mid and high is updated to n - 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, and k is an element in arr, pos is the index of k in arr, i is equal to n, low and high are updated based on the comparison of arr[mid] and k, mid is equal to (low + high) // 2, st is a set containing mid and the previous value of mid. If arr[mid] > k, then low is less than mid and high is equal to mid. Otherwise, low is equal to mid. !
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `arr` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, and k is an element in arr, `pos` is the index of k in arr, `i` is equal to n, `low` is less than mid and `low` + 1 is less than `high`, `mid` is equal to (`low` + `high`) // 2, `st` is a set containing (`low` + `high`) // 2 and the previous value of (`low` + `high`) // 2. If `arr[mid]` > k, then `high` is equal to (`low` + `high`) // 2. Otherwise, `low` is equal to mid which is equal to (low + high) // 2.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
