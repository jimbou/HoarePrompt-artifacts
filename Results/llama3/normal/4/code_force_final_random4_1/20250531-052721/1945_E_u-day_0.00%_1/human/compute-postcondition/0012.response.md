Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 0, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, and k is an element in arr, pos is the index of k in arr, i is equal to n, low is 0, high is n - 1, st is an empty set.**

The code initializes two new variables, `low` and `high`, and assigns them the values 0 and `n - 1`, respectively. It also creates an empty set `st`. The values of `n`, `k`, `arr`, `pos`, and `i` remain unchanged.
