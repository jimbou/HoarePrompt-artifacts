Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `arr` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, and `k` is an element in `arr`. If the first element of `arr` is equal to `k`, then `pos` is 0 and `i` is 0. Otherwise, the state of `pos` and `i` remains unchanged.***
