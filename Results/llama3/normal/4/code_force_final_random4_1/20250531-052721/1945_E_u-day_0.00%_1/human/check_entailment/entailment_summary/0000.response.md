Reasoning: 
The given program is designed to solve a problem where a binary search algorithm is applied to an unsorted permutation of integers. The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm so that after the algorithm is executed, the target value `x` is found at the index `l`. The program uses a binary search approach to find the target value and prints the number of operations required to achieve this, along with the indices of the elements that need to be swapped.

The program consists of three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`. `func_1` reads a space-separated list of integers from standard input and returns a map object containing these integers. `func_2` takes no parameters and returns a list of values produced by the iterator `func_1`. `func_3` is the main function that performs the binary search and prints the result.

The execution summaries of the functions suggest that the program is correct. `func_1` and `func_2` are used to read the input and convert it into a list of integers, respectively. `func_3` performs the binary search and prints the result, which includes the number of operations required and the indices of the elements that need to be swapped.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the binary search algorithm. The use of a set `st` to keep track of the indices that have been visited during the binary search is also a good practice to avoid infinite loops.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of the functions, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
