Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, and k is an element in arr, pos is the index of k in arr, i is equal to n, low and high are updated based on the comparison of arr[mid] and k, mid is equal to (low + high) // 2, st is a set containing mid and the previous value of mid. If arr[mid] > k, then low is less than mid and high is equal to mid. Otherwise, low is equal to mid. !***
