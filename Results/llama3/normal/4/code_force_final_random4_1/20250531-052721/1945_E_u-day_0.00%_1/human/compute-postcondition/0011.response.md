Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `arr` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, and `k` is an element in `arr`. `pos` is the index of `k` in `arr`, and `i` is equal to `n`.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `pos` will be the index of the element `k` in the list `arr`, and the loop counter `i` will have reached the end of the list, i.e., `i` will be equal to `n`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `arr` remain unchanged throughout the loop's execution.
