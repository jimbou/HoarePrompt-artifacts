Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, and k is an element in arr, pos is the index of k in arr, i is equal to n, low is less than mid and low + 1 is less than high, high is equal to mid, mid is equal to (low + high) // 2, st is a set containing (low + high) // 2 and the previous value of (low + high) // 2.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line updates the value of `mid` to be the average of `low` and `high`, which is a common operation in binary search algorithms. The second line adds the new value of `mid` to the set `st`. 

Since `low` is less than `mid` and `low + 1` is less than `high`, the new value of `mid` will be less than `high` but greater than or equal to `low`. The set `st` now contains the new value of `mid` and the previous value of `mid`. 

All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `n` is still a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is still a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `arr` is still a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, and `k` is still an element in `arr`. The index of `k` in `arr` is still `pos`, and `i` is still equal to `n`.
