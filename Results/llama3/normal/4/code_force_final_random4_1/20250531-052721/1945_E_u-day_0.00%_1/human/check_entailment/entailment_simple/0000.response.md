Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the binary search algorithm on a permutation array after at most two swaps. The program first finds the position of the target value `k` in the array `arr`. Then, it performs a binary search on the array. If the value at the final `low` index is equal to `k`, it prints 0, indicating that no swaps are needed. Otherwise, it prints 1 and the indices of the swap operation needed to move `k` to the correct position.

The program correctly handles the case where `k` is already at the correct position and the case where one swap is needed to move `k` to the correct position. The use of a set `st` to store the mid values is unnecessary and can be removed, but it does not affect the correctness of the program.

Correctness: **True**
