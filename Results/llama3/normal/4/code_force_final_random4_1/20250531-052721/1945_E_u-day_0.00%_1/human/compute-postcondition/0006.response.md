Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `arr` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, and `k` is an element in `arr`. If the first element of `arr` is equal to `k`, then `pos` is 1 and `i` is 1. Otherwise, `pos` is equal to the previous value of `i` and `i` remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `pos` is updated to be equal to the value of `i`. If the first element of `arr` is equal to `k`, then `pos` is now 1, and `i` is also 1. If the first element of `arr` is not equal to `k`, then `pos` is equal to the previous value of `i`, and `i` remains unchanged. The values of `n`, `k`, and `arr` are not affected by the code.
