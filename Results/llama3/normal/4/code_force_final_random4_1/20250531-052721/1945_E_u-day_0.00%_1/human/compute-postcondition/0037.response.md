The code prints the value of `low + 1` and `pos + 1`. Since `low` is equal to `high`, and `mid` is equal to `low`, we can infer that `low` and `mid` have the same value. Additionally, since the value at index `low` in the array `arr` is not equal to `k`, we can conclude that `low` does not point to the desired value `k` in the array.

The value of `pos` is not explicitly defined in the precondition, but based on the context, it is likely that `pos` represents the position of the desired value `k` in the array. Since `pos` is being printed, we can assume that it has a valid value.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `low + 1` and `pos + 1`. Since `low` is equal to `high`, we can substitute `high` for `low` in the expression, resulting in `high + 1`. Similarly, we can substitute `pos` for `pos + 1`.

Output: **high + 1, pos + 1 (where high is the value of high and pos is the position of the desired value k in the array)**
