Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `arr` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, and k is an element in arr, `pos` is the index of k in arr, `i` is equal to n, `low` is equal to mid which is equal to (low + high) // 2, `high` is equal to mid, `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2, `st` is a set containing (low + high) // 2 and the previous value of (low + high) // 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `k`, `arr`, `pos`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `low` is updated to be equal to `mid`, which is the average of the previous `low` and `high` values. The values of `high`, `mid`, and `st` also remain unchanged.
