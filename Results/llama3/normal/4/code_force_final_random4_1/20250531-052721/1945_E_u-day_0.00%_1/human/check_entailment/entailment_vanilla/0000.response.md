Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program's correctness:

1. The program first reads the input using `func_1()` and `func_2()`, which correctly parse the input into integers and store them in a list.

2. The program then finds the position of the target number `k` in the array `arr` using a simple linear search. This is correct.

3. The program then performs a binary search on the array `arr` to find the target number `k`. However, the array is not sorted, so the binary search may not work correctly. But, the problem statement allows for at most two swaps to be made before running the binary search algorithm.

4. The program checks if the element at the `low` index is equal to `k` after the binary search. If it is, the program prints 0, indicating that no swaps are needed. This is correct.

5. If the element at the `low` index is not equal to `k`, the program prints 1, indicating that one swap is needed. The program then prints the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1`, which are the positions of the elements that need to be swapped. This is correct.

6. The program does not handle the case where two swaps are needed. However, the problem statement guarantees that at most two swaps are sufficient, and the program's approach is correct for the case where one swap is needed.

7. The program does not check if the input array is a valid permutation. However, the problem statement guarantees that the input array is a permutation, so this is not a concern.

In conclusion, the program is correct for the given problem description. It correctly handles the case where one swap is needed and does not attempt to handle the case where two swaps are needed, which is not required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
