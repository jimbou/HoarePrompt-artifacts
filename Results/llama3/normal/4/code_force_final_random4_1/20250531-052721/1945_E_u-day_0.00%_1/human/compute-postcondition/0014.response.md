Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, and k is an element in arr, pos is the index of k in arr, i is equal to n, low is 0, high is n - 1, mid is the integer part of the average of low and high, st is a set containing mid.**

In this output state, the value of mid is calculated as the integer part of the average of low and high. The set st now contains the value of mid. All other variables remain unchanged.
