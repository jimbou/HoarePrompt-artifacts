To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to examine the loop condition: `low + 1 < high`. This condition must be true for the loop to execute at least once.

Given the initial states:
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 0.
- `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n.
- `arr` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, and k is an element in arr.
- `pos` is the index of k in arr.
- `i` is equal to n.
- `low` is 0.
- `high` is n - 1.
- `st` is an empty set.

The variables in the loop head are `low` and `high`. The condition `low + 1 < high` must be satisfied for the loop to execute. Given that `low` is 0 and `high` is n - 1, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 to satisfy the condition `low + 1 < high`.

Thus, the only adjustment needed is to ensure `n` is greater than 1. All other states remain unchanged as they do not affect the loop condition directly.

State: **n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, and k is an element in arr, pos is the index of k in arr, i is equal to n, low is 0, high is n - 1, st is an empty set.**
