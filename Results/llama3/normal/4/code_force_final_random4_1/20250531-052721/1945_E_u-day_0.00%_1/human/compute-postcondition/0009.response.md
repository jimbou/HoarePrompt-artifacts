Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `arr` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, and `k` is an element in `arr`, `i` is `i + 1`, `pos` is `i + 1`**

In this output state, the value of `pos` has been updated to be equal to `i + 1`, which is the new value of `i` after the increment operation. The other variables remain unchanged, with `n` still being a positive integer greater than 0, `k` still being a positive integer between 1 and `n`, and `arr` still being a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, with `k` being an element in `arr`.
