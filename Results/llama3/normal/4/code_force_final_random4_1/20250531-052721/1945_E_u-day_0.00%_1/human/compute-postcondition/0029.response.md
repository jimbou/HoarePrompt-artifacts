Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `arr` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, and k is an element in arr, `pos` is the index of k in arr, `i` is equal to n, `low` is less than mid and `low` + 1 is less than `high`, `mid` is equal to (`low` + `high`) // 2, `st` is a set containing (`low` + `high`) // 2 and the previous value of (`low` + `high`) // 2. If `arr[mid]` > k, then `high` is equal to (`low` + `high`) // 2. Otherwise, `low` is equal to mid which is equal to (low + high) // 2.**
