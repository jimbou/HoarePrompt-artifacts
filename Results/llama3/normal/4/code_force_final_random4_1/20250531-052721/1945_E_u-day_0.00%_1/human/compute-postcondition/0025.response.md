According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `low` and `high`. If `low + 1` is less than `high`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `low` is less than `mid` and `high` is equal to `mid`. Since `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, we know that `low` is less than `high`. However, we cannot guarantee that `low + 1` is less than `high` based on the current state. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `low` and `high` to ensure that `low + 1` is less than `high`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `arr` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, and `k` is an element in `arr`, `pos` is the index of `k` in `arr`, `i` is equal to `n`, `low` is less than `mid` and `low + 1` is less than `high`, `high` is equal to `mid`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `st` is a set containing `mid` and the previous value of `mid`.**
