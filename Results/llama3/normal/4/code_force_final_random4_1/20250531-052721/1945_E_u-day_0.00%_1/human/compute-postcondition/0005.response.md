The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, `n` is greater than `i`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `arr` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, and `k` is an element in `arr`. If the first element of `arr` is equal to `k`, then `pos` is 0 and `i` is 1. Otherwise, the state of `pos` and `i` remains unchanged.**
