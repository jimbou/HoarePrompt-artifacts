Output State: **low is equal to high, mid is equal to low, st is a set containing all the mid values from previous iterations.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the `low` and `high` variables have converged to the same value, which is also equal to the `mid` value. The `st` set contains all the `mid` values from previous iterations. The other variables, `n`, `k`, `arr`, `pos`, and `i`, remain unchanged.
