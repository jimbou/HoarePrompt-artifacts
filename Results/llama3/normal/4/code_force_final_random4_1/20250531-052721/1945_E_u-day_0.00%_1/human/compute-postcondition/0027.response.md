Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `arr` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, and k is an element in arr, `pos` is the index of k in arr, `i` is equal to n, `low` is less than mid and `low` + 1 is less than `high`, `mid` is equal to (`low` + `high`) // 2, `st` is a set containing (`low` + `high`) // 2 and the previous value of (`low` + `high`) // 2, `high` is equal to (`low` + `high`) // 2.**

In this output state, the value of `high` has been updated to be equal to `mid`, which is equal to (`low` + `high`) // 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The set `st` still contains the previous value of (`low` + `high`) // 2, which is now equal to the current value of `high`.
