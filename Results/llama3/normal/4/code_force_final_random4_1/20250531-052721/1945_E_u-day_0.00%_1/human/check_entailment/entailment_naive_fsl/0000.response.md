Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, if the input is:

5
1 2 3 4 5

The program will output:

0

However, the correct output should be:

1
1 1

Because the binary search algorithm requires the array to be sorted, and the given array is already sorted, no swaps are needed. But the program does not handle this case correctly.

Also, the program does not handle the case when the target element is not present in the array. In this case, the program should output an error message or a special value to indicate that the element is not found. But the program does not handle this case correctly.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
