Output State: **n is an integer such that 0 <= n < k, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^18, n is not equal to k, n is less than k, costs is a list containing two integers: n - k + 1 and 1 that must have at least 2 elements, i is 1, h is equal to the original value of n divided by i, rounded down, plus the current value of n divided by i, rounded down, plus the current value of n divided by i, rounded down, n is equal to the original value of n minus i times the current value of n divided by i, rounded down, minus i times the current value of n divided by i, rounded down.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated twice, first by subtracting `i` times the current value of `n` divided by `i`, rounded down, and then again by subtracting `i` times the new value of `n` divided by `i`, rounded down. The value of `h` has also been updated by adding the current value of `n` divided by `i`, rounded down, twice. The values of `k`, `costs`, and `i` remain unchanged.
