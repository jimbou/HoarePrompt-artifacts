Output: **n is 0, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^18, n is not equal to k, and n is less than k, costs is a list containing two integers: n - k + 1 and 1 that must have at least 2 elements, i is 1, h is equal to or larger than k, and h is equal to the original value of n divided by i, rounded down, plus the current value of n divided by i, rounded down, plus the current value of n divided by i, rounded down, plus ... (until n becomes 0), n is equal to the original value of n minus i times the current value of n divided by i, rounded down, minus i times the current value of n divided by i, rounded down, minus i times the current value of n divided by i, rounded down, minus ... (until n becomes 0), 'YES' is printed, and the number 2 is printed**
