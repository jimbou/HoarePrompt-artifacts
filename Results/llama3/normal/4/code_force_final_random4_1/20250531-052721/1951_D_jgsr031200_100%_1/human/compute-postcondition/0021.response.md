Output State: **n is 0, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^18, n is not equal to k, and n is less than k, costs is a list containing two integers: n - k + 1 and 1 that must have at least 2 elements, i is 1, h is equal to the original value of n divided by i, rounded down, plus the current value of n divided by i, rounded down, plus the current value of n divided by i, rounded down, plus ... (until n becomes 0), n is equal to the original value of n minus i times the current value of n divided by i, rounded down, minus i times the current value of n divided by i, rounded down, minus i times the current value of n divided by i, rounded down, minus ... (until n becomes 0).**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the value of `n` becomes 0, while the value of `k` remains unchanged. The list `costs` still contains two integers, but the value of `i` is always 1. The value of `h` is the sum of the quotients of the original value of `n` divided by `i` (which is always 1), rounded down, plus the current value of `n` divided by `i` (which is always 1), rounded down, and so on, until `n` becomes 0. The value of `n` is reduced by `i` times the current value of `n` divided by `i`, rounded down, in each iteration, until it becomes 0.
