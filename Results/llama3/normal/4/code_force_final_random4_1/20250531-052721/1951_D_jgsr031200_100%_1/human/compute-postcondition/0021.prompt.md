Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^18, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^18, n is not equal to k, and n is greater than or equal to k, costs is a list containing two integers: n - k + 1 and 1, h is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in costs:
    curr = n // i
    h += curr
    n -= i * curr


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer such that 0 <= n < k, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^18, n is not equal to k, and n is less than k, costs is a list containing two integers: n - k + 1 and 1 that must have at least 1 element, i is the first element in the list, h is equal to the original value of n divided by i, rounded down.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer such that 0 <= n < k, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^18, n is not equal to k, and n is less than k, costs is a list containing two integers: n - k + 1 and 1 that must have at least 2 elements, i is 1, h is equal to the original value of n divided by i, rounded down, plus the current value of n divided by i, rounded down, n is equal to the original value of n minus i times the current value of n divided by i, rounded down.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer such that 0 <= n < k, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^18, n is not equal to k, n is less than k, costs is a list containing two integers: n - k + 1 and 1 that must have at least 2 elements, i is 1, h is equal to the original value of n divided by i, rounded down, plus the current value of n divided by i, rounded down, plus the current value of n divided by i, rounded down, n is equal to the original value of n minus i times the current value of n divided by i, rounded down, minus i times the current value of n divided by i, rounded down.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
