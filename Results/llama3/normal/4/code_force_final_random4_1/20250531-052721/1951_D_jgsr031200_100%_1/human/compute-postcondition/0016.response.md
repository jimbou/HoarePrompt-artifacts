Output State: **n is an integer such that 0 <= n < k, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^18, n is not equal to k, and n is less than k, costs is a list containing two integers: n - k + 1 and 1 that must have at least 1 element, i is the first element in the list, h is equal to the original value of n divided by i, rounded down.**

The code first calculates the integer division of `n` by `i` and assigns it to `curr`. Then, it increments `h` by `curr`. After that, it subtracts the product of `i` and `curr` from `n`. As a result, `n` becomes less than `k`, and `h` becomes equal to the original value of `n` divided by `i`, rounded down. The values of `k`, `costs`, and `i` remain unchanged.
