Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Bob can set up at most 60 stalls and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels. The program takes two inputs, n and k, representing the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy, respectively.

The program first checks if n is equal to k. If so, it prints "YES" and sets up a single stall with a price of 1, which will result in Alice buying exactly k jewels.

If n is not equal to k, the program checks if n is less than k. If so, it prints "NO" because it is impossible for Alice to buy exactly k jewels with less than k coins.

If n is greater than or equal to k, the program calculates the number of jewels Alice can buy with the first stall by dividing n by the price of the first stall (n - k + 1). It then calculates the remaining number of coins Alice has after buying jewels from the first stall.

The program then sets up a second stall with a price of 1 and calculates the number of jewels Alice can buy from this stall using the remaining coins. The total number of jewels Alice buys is the sum of the jewels bought from the first and second stalls.

If the total number of jewels Alice buys is less than k, the program prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES" and sets up two stalls with prices n - k + 1 and 1, respectively.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
