To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that must be met for the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for i in costs:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `i` and `costs`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `costs` is a list containing two integers: `n - k + 1` and `1`, and `i` is the first element in the list.

For the loop to execute again, `costs` must have at least one more element, and `i` must be the next element in the list.

Since `costs` has only two elements, the next element would be the second element, which is `1`.

So, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `1`, and `costs` should still have at least two elements.

The other variables, `n`, `k`, and `h`, are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 0 <= n < k, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^18, `n` is not equal to `k`, and `n` is less than `k`, `costs` is a list containing two integers: `n - k + 1` and `1` that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `h` is equal to the original value of `n` divided by `i`, rounded down**

Note that the value of `h` is not explicitly updated, as it is not part of the loop head. However, its value can be recalculated based on the new value of `i`.
