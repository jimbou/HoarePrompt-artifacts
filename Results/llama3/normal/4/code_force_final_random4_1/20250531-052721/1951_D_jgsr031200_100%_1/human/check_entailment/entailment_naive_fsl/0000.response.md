Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when `n` is equal to `k` and `n` is greater than 1. In this case, the program prints 'YES' and then prints 1 and 1, which is incorrect because it does not fulfill the condition that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. The correct output should be 'YES' followed by 1 and `n`, not 1 and 1.

For example, if the input is `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the program prints 'YES' and then 1 and 1, but the correct output should be 'YES' and then 1 and 2.
