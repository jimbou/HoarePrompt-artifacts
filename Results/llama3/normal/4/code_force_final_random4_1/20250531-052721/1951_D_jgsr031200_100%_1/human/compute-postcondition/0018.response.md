Output State: **n is an integer such that 0 <= n < k, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^18, n is not equal to k, and n is less than k, costs is a list containing two integers: n - k + 1 and 1 that must have at least 2 elements, i is 1, h is equal to the original value of n divided by i, rounded down, plus the current value of n divided by i, rounded down, n is equal to the original value of n minus i times the current value of n divided by i, rounded down.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `h` and `n`. The first line calculates the current value of `n` divided by `i`, rounded down, and assigns it to `curr`. The second line increments `h` by the value of `curr`. The third line subtracts `i` times the value of `curr` from `n`. 

The value of `h` is updated by adding the current value of `n` divided by `i`, rounded down, to its original value. The value of `n` is updated by subtracting `i` times the current value of `n` divided by `i`, rounded down, from its original value. 

The values of `k`, `costs`, and `i` remain unchanged. The list `costs` still contains two integers: `n - k + 1` and `1`, and `i` is still equal to `1`. The value of `k` is still an integer such that `1 <= k <= 10^18`, and `n` is still not equal to `k` and less than `k`.
