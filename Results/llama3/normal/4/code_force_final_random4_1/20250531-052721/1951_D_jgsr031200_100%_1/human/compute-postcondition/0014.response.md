Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^18, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^18, n is not equal to k, and n is greater than or equal to k, costs is a list containing two integers: n - k + 1 and 1, h is 0**

In this output state, the values of n and k remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The code creates a new list called costs and assigns it two values: n - k + 1 and 1. The value of n - k + 1 is calculated using the initial values of n and k. The variable h is assigned a value of 0.
