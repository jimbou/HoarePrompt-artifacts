Reasoning: The given program is correct. It correctly determines whether it is possible to reach a target value `k` by subtracting a sequence of decreasing integers from a starting value `n`. The program handles all possible cases correctly: if `n` is equal to `k`, it prints 'YES' and 1 twice; if `n` is less than `k`, it prints 'NO'; if `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, it calculates the minimum number of subtractions required to reach `k` and prints 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether the calculated value is less than or greater than or equal to `k`. If 'YES' is printed, it also prints the number 2 and the sequence of subtractions used to reach `k`.

Correctness: **True**
