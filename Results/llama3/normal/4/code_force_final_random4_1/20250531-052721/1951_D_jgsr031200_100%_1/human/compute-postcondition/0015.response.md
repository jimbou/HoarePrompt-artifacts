According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `costs`. If the list has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^18, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^18, n is not equal to k, and n is greater than or equal to k, h is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 element and the i is the first element in the list.
State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^18, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^18, n is not equal to k, and n is greater than or equal to k, costs is a list containing two integers: n - k + 1 and 1 that must have at least 1 element, i is the first element in the list, h is 0**
