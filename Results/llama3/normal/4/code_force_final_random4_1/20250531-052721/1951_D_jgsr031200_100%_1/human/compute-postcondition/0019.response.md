To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the current state.

The loop head is `for i in costs:`, which means the loop will iterate over the elements of the `costs` list. The current state is:

* `n` is an integer such that 0 <= n < k
* `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^18
* `n` is not equal to `k`
* `n` is less than `k`
* `costs` is a list containing two integers: `n - k + 1` and `1` that must have at least 2 elements
* `i` is 1
* `h` is equal to the original value of `n` divided by `i`, rounded down, plus the current value of `n` divided by `i`, rounded down
* `n` is equal to the original value of `n` minus `i` times the current value of `n` divided by `i`, rounded down

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider what happens when the loop iterates over the second element of the `costs` list.

Since `i` is currently 1, the next iteration will assign the second element of `costs` to `i`, which is 1. Therefore, the state of `i` will not change.

The state of `n` will also not change, as it is not affected by the loop iteration.

The state of `h` will change, as it depends on the value of `n` and `i`. However, since `i` is still 1, the calculation of `h` will not change.

The state of `costs` will not change, as it is not modified by the loop iteration.

The state of `k` will not change, as it is not affected by the loop iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 0 <= n < k, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^18, `n` is not equal to `k`, `n` is less than `k`, `costs` is a list containing two integers: `n - k + 1` and `1` that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `h` is equal to the original value of `n` divided by `i`, rounded down, plus the current value of `n` divided by `i`, rounded down, `n` is equal to the original value of `n` minus `i` times the current value of `n` divided by `i`, rounded down**

Note that the state of `costs` is still the same, as the loop iteration does not modify the list.
