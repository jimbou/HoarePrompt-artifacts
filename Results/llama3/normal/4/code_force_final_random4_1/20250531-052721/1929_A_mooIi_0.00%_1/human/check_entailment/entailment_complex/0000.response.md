Reasoning: 
The given Python program is incorrect because it does not calculate the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement. Instead, it simply sorts the input integers in ascending order, converts them to strings, and prints them joined by a space. The program does not perform any calculations to determine the maximum beauty of the array.

Correctness: **False**
