To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and understand what conditions must be met for the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. Here, the only variable in the loop head is the loop variable `_`, which is not explicitly used in the loop body (hence the underscore). The loop will execute as long as there are remaining iterations in the `range` object, which is created from the integer value read from `input()`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `n` is an integer, `ar` is a map object containing sorted integers as strings, `stdin` contains 0 test cases, and the sorted integers in the map object `ar` are printed as a string separated by spaces.

To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the following:

* The loop will execute again if there are remaining iterations in the `range` object. This means that the integer value read from `input()` must be greater than the current iteration count.
* Since the loop variable `_` is not used, we don't need to adjust its value.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is an integer, `ar` is a map object containing sorted integers as strings, `stdin` contains 1 test case, and the sorted integers in the map object `ar` are printed as a string separated by spaces**

Note that we've incremented the test case count in `stdin` to 1, indicating that the loop has executed once and is ready to execute again. The other variables remain unchanged.
