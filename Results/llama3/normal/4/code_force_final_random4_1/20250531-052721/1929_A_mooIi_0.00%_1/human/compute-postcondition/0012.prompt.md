Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (2 <= n <= 100). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    ar = map(str, sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))
    print(' '.join(ar))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer, ar is a map object containing sorted integers as strings, stdin contains 0 test cases, and the sorted integers in the map object ar are printed as a string separated by spaces

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer equal to the input value, ar is a map object containing the sorted integers from the input as strings, stdin is empty, and the sorted integers from the input as strings are printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer equal to the new input value, ar is a map object containing the sorted integers from the new input as strings, stdin is empty, the sorted integers from the new input as strings are printed, _ is 1, and the sorted integers from the new input as strings joined by a space are printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
