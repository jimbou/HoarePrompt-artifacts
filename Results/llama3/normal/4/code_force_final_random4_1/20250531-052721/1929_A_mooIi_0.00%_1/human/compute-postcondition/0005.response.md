Output State: **n is an integer equal to the input value, ar is a map object containing the sorted integers from the input as strings, stdin is empty**

In this final state, the value of `n` has been updated to the integer value read from the input. The `ar` map object now contains the sorted integers from the input as strings. The `stdin` is empty, indicating that all input has been consumed by the program.
