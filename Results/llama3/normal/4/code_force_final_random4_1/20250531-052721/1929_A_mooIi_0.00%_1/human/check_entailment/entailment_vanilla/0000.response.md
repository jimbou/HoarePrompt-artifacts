Reasoning:

The given program is supposed to solve the problem of finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

However, the provided program does not correctly solve this problem. Here's why:

1. The program sorts the array in ascending order, which is correct. This is because the maximum beauty can be achieved by arranging the elements in ascending order, so that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

2. However, the program then prints the sorted array as a string, joined by spaces. This is not what the problem asks for. The problem asks for the maximum beauty of the array, which is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

3. The program does not calculate this sum. It simply prints the sorted array, which is not the correct output.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
