Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The problem requires the program to calculate the maximum beauty of the array, which is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. However, the program is currently sorting the array and printing the sorted elements as strings, rather than calculating the sum of the differences.

The program is missing the calculation of the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. It should calculate the sum of the differences by iterating over the sorted array and adding the difference between each pair of consecutive elements to a running total.

Correctness: **False**
