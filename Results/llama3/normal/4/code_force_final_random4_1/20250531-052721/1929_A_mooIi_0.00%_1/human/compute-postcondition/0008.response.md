To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the given state.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable in the loop head is the loop variable `_`, which is not explicitly used in the loop body. The `range` function is used to generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `int(input()) - 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

* `n` is an integer equal to the input value
* `ar` is a map object containing the sorted integers from the input as strings
* `stdin` is empty
* The sorted integers from the input as strings are printed

To execute the loop one more time, the loop head needs to be adjusted as follows:

* `_` should be incremented by 1, since it is the loop variable.
* `int(input())` should be decremented by 1, since the range function generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to `int(input()) - 1`. If `int(input())` is 0, the loop will not execute again.

Note that the state of `ar`, `stdin`, and the printed output does not affect the loop head and can remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is an integer equal to the input value minus 1, `ar` is a map object containing the sorted integers from the input as strings, `stdin` is empty, and the sorted integers from the input as strings are printed, `_` is 1**
