Output State: **n is an integer, ar is a map object containing sorted integers as strings, stdin contains 0 test cases**

The first line of the code assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since stdin contains at least 1 test case, `n` becomes an integer. The second line assigns to `ar` a map object containing the sorted integers from the input as strings. The `sorted` function sorts the integers in ascending order, and the `map` function converts them to strings. The `list` function is used to convert the input to a list, and the `map` function is used to convert the integers to strings. The `input().split()` function splits the input into a list of strings, which are then converted to integers by the `map(int, ...)` function. 

After the execution of the code, `n` is an integer, and `ar` is a map object containing sorted integers as strings. Stdin is empty, as all the test cases have been consumed by the `input()` function.
