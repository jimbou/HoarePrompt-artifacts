Output State: **n is an integer equal to the new input value, ar is a map object containing the sorted integers from the new input as strings, stdin is empty, the sorted integers from the new input as strings are printed, _ is 1**

In this code snippet, the first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. The second line assigns to `ar` a map object containing the sorted integers from the new input as strings. The sorted integers from the new input as strings are printed. The value of `_` remains unchanged. No other variables are affected.
