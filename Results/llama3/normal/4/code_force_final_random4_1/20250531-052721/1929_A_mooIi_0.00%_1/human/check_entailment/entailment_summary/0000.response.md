Reasoning:

The provided program is not correct. The task is to find the maximum beauty of the array, which is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. However, the program simply sorts the array and prints the sorted elements, without calculating the sum of the differences.

The correct approach would be to calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array, which can be done by iterating over the sorted array and adding the differences to a running total.

Correctness: **False**
