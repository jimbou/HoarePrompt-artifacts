Output State: **n is an integer equal to the input value, ar is a map object containing the sorted integers from the input as strings, stdin is empty, the sorted integers from the input as strings are printed, _ is equal to the number of test cases, and the sorted integers from the input as strings joined by a space are printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable n will hold the value of the last test case, the map object ar will contain the sorted integers from the last test case as strings, the standard input (stdin) will be empty because all test cases have been processed, the sorted integers from the last test case will be printed as strings, the loop counter _ will be equal to the total number of test cases, and the sorted integers from the last test case will be printed joined by a space.
