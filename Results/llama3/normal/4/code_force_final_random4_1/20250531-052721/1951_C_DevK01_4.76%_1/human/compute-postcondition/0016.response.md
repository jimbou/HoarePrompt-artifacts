Based on the precondition, we can determine the values of the variables and objects involved in the print statement.

The value of `cost` depends on whether `n * m` equals `k`. If `n * m` equals `k`, then `N` is a list of the `q` smallest integers from `M`, where `q` is the ceiling of `k/m`. In this case, `cost` is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.

If `n * m` does not equal `k`, then `N` is a list of the `q-1` smallest integers from `M`, where `q` is the ceiling of `k/m`. In this case, `cost` is calculated as `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`, where `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m` and `w` is the largest integer from `N`.

Since the exact values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `M` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `cost`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated cost.

Output: **cost (where cost is the calculated cost based on the values of n, m, k, and M)**
