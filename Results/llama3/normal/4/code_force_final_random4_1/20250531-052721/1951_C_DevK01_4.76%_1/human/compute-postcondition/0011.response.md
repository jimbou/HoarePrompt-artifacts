The only variable in the loop head is variable  `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `t` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 and `t` must be decreased by 1.
State: **`t` is a positive integer minus 1, `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is the length of the list N, m is the minimum of the original m and k, k is the same as the original k, L is a list of three integers n, m, and k, M is a sorted list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, N is a list of the q smallest integers from M, q is the ceiling of k/m. If n * m equals k, then cost is m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2). Otherwise, n is the length of the list N minus 1, L is a list of three integers n+1, m, and k, N is a list of the q-1 smallest integers from M, w is the qth smallest integer from M, mu is k - (n - 1) * m, and cost is mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu**
