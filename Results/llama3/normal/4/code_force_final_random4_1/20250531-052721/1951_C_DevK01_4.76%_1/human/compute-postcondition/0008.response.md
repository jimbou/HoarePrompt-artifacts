Based on the initial state, the print statement will print the calculated cost.

If n * m equals k, then the cost is the sum of three terms:
- m times the sum of the q smallest integers from the sorted list M (i.e., m * sum(N))
- m squared times the sum of the first n-1 positive integers (i.e., m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2))

Otherwise, the cost is the sum of four terms:
- mu (k - (n - 1) * m) times the qth smallest integer from the sorted list M (i.e., mu * w)
- m times the sum of the q-1 smallest integers from the sorted list M (i.e., m * sum(N))
- m squared times the sum of the first n-2 positive integers (i.e., m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2))
- n times m times mu (i.e., n * m * mu)

Output: **cost (where cost is the calculated cost based on the given conditions and values of n, m, k, M, N, q, mu, and w)**
