Output State: **t is a positive integer, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is the length of the list N, m is the minimum of the original m and k, k is the same as the original k, L is a list of three integers n, m, and k, M is a sorted list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, N is a list of the q smallest integers from M, q is the ceiling of k/m.**

The code reads two lines of input for each test case, so the number of test cases in stdin decreases by 1. The list L contains the three integers n, m, and k from the first line of input. The list M contains the n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n from the second line of input, sorted in ascending order. The variable m is updated to be the minimum of the original m and k. The variable q is calculated as the ceiling of k/m. The list N contains the q smallest integers from M. The variable n is updated to be the length of the list N. The variables t and _ are not affected by the code.
