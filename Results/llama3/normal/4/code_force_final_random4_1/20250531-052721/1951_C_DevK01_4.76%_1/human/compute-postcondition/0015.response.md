Postcondition: **t is a positive integer minus 1, _ is 1, stdin is empty, n is q, m is the minimum of the original m and k, k is the same as the original k, L is a list of three integers n, m, and k, M is a sorted list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. If n * m equals k, then N is a list of the q smallest integers from M, q is the ceiling of k/m, and cost is m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2). Otherwise, N is a list of the q-1 smallest integers from M, q is the ceiling of k/m, w is the largest integer from N, mu is k - (n - 1) * m, and cost is mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu.**
