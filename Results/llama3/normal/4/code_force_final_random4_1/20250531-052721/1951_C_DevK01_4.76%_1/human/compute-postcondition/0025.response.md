Output: **t is a positive integer minus 1, _ is 2, stdin is empty, n is q if n * m equals k, otherwise n is the length of N, m is the minimum of the original m and k, k is the same as the original k, L is a list of three integers n, m, and k, M is a sorted list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, N is a list of the q smallest integers from M if n * m equals k, otherwise N is a list of the q-1 smallest integers from M, q is the ceiling of k/m, w is the largest integer from N if n * m does not equal k, mu is k - (n - 1) * m if n * m does not equal k, and cost is m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) if n * m equals k, otherwise cost is mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu, and the cost is printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
