Based on the precondition, the print statement will print the calculated cost.

If n * m equals k, the cost is calculated as m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2). Here, N is a list of the q smallest integers from M, where q is the ceiling of k/m. The sum(N) is the sum of these q smallest integers.

If n * m does not equal k, the cost is calculated as mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu. Here, mu is k - (n - 1) * m, w is the largest integer from N, and N is a list of the q-1 smallest integers from M.

In both cases, the cost is a calculated value based on the given variables and lists.

Output: **the calculated cost (which is m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) if n * m equals k, otherwise mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu)**
