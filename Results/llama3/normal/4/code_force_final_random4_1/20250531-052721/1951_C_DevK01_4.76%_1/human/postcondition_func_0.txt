This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines of input. The first line contains three integers n, m, and k, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. The function calculates the minimum cost based on the given integers and prints the result for each test case. The cost is calculated by sorting the integers, selecting the smallest q integers, and applying a formula that depends on whether n * m equals k or not. The function processes all test cases and empties the standard input.
