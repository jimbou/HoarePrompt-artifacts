Output State: **t is 0, _ is t, stdin is empty, n is q if n * m equals k, otherwise n is the length of N, m is the minimum of the original m and k, k is the same as the original k, L is a list of three integers n, m, and k, M is a sorted list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, N is a list of the q smallest integers from M if n * m equals k, otherwise N is a list of the q-1 smallest integers from M, q is the ceiling of k/m, w is the largest integer from N if n * m does not equal k, mu is k - (n - 1) * m if n * m does not equal k, and cost is m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) if n * m equals k, otherwise cost is mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing all the test cases in the input. The variable t, which represents the number of test cases, is now 0. The variable _, which is used to iterate over the range of t, is now equal to the original value of t. The input (stdin) is empty because all the test cases have been processed. The variables n, m, k, L, M, N, q, w, and mu have the same values as they did after the last iteration of the loop. The cost has been calculated and printed for each test case.
