Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines of input. The first line contains three integers n, m, and k (1 <= n <= 3*10^5, 1 <= m <= 10^9, 1 <= k <= min(n*m, 10^9)). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).**

In natural language, the output state is: The variable `t` is assigned a positive integer value from the input, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases, each with two lines of input. The first line of each test case contains three integers n, m, and k within the specified ranges, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n within the specified range.
