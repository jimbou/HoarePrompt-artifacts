Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets. 

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases t, and then for each test case, it reads the number of sale days n, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day m, and the number of tickets to be bought k.

2. It then reads the prices per ticket for each of the upcoming n days and stores them in the list M.

3. The program then sorts the list M in ascending order.

4. It calculates the minimum number of days q required to buy k tickets, which is the ceiling of k/m.

5. If the total number of tickets that can be bought in q days (i.e., n*m) is equal to k, it calculates the cost by multiplying the sum of the prices of the tickets in the first q days by m, and then adds the additional cost due to the increase in prices.

6. If the total number of tickets that can be bought in q days is not equal to k, it calculates the cost by multiplying the price of the ticket on the last day by the number of tickets to be bought on that day, and then adds the cost of buying the remaining tickets in the previous days.

7. Finally, it prints the minimum cost.

The program correctly handles the edge cases and the logic is sound. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
