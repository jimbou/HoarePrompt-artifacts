Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when the number of tickets to be bought (k) is not a multiple of the maximum number of tickets that can be purchased per day (m). In this case, the program incorrectly calculates the cost of the tickets.

For example, if n = 4, m = 2, k = 3, and the prices per ticket for each day are [8, 6, 4, 2], the program will output 10, which is incorrect. The correct output should be 12, because the optimal way to buy 3 tickets is to buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4, and 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6, and the prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 3].

The program incorrectly assumes that the number of tickets to be bought is always a multiple of the maximum number of tickets that can be purchased per day, which is not always the case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
