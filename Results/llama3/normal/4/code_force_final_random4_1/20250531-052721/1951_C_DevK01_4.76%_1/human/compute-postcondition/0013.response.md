Output State: **t is a positive integer minus 1, _ is 1, stdin is empty, n is q, m is the minimum of the original m and k, k is the same as the original k, L is a list of three integers n, m, and k, M is a sorted list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, N is a list of the q smallest integers from M, q is the ceiling of k/m, cost is m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)**

In this output state, the value of cost is calculated based on the values of m, N, n, and q. The value of cost is the sum of two terms: m times the sum of the q smallest integers from M (which is stored in N), and m squared times the sum of the first n-1 positive integers (which is calculated as (n-1)*n//2). The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
