Output State: **t is a positive integer minus 1, _ is 1, stdin is empty, n is the number of elements in N after popping one element, m is the minimum of the original m and k, k is the same as the original k, L is a list of three integers n, m, and k, M is a sorted list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, N is a list of the q-1 smallest integers from M, q is the ceiling of k/m, w is the largest integer from N, mu is k - (n - 1) * m, cost is mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu.**

The code executes as follows: The first line removes the largest integer from N and assigns it to w. The second line calculates mu as k - (n - 1) * m. The third line calculates the initial cost as mu * w. The fourth line updates n to be the number of elements in N after popping one element. The fifth line updates the cost by adding m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu.
