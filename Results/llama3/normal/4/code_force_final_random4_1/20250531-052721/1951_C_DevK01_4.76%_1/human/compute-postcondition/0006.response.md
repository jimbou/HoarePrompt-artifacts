Output State: **t is a positive integer, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is the length of the list N minus 1, m is the minimum of the original m and k, k is the same as the original k, L is a list of three integers n+1, m, and k, M is a sorted list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, N is a list of the q-1 smallest integers from M, q is the ceiling of k/m, w is the qth smallest integer from M, mu is k - (n - 1) * m, cost is mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `n`, `N`, `w`, `mu`, and `cost`. The value of `n` is updated to be the length of the list `N` minus 1, since one element is removed from `N` and assigned to `w`. The list `N` is also updated by removing its last element, which is assigned to `w`. The value of `mu` is calculated as `k - (n - 1) * m`, and the value of `cost` is calculated using the updated values of `mu`, `w`, `N`, and `n`. The other variables, including `t`, `_`, `stdin`, `m`, `k`, `L`, `M`, and `q`, remain unchanged.
