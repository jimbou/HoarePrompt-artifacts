Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines of input. The first line contains three integers n, m, and k (1 <= n <= 3*10^5, 1 <= m <= 10^9, 1 <= k <= min(n*m, 10^9)). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    L = list(map(int, input().split()))
    M = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n, m, k = L[0], L[1], L[2]
    m = min(m, k)
    M.sort()
    q = int(math.ceil(k / m))
    N = M[:q]
    n = len(N)
    if n * m == k:
        cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)
    else:
        w = N.pop()
        mu = k - (n - 1) * m
        cost = mu * w
        n = len(N)
        cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu
    print(cost)
    continue


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is the length of the list N, m is the minimum of the original m and k, k is the same as the original k, L is a list of three integers n, m, and k, M is a sorted list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, N is a list of the q smallest integers from M, q is the ceiling of k/m. If n * m equals k, then cost is m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2). Otherwise, n is the length of the list N minus 1, L is a list of three integers n+1, m, and k, N is a list of the q-1 smallest integers from M, w is the qth smallest integer from M, mu is k - (n - 1) * m, and cost is mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is a positive integer minus 1, _ is 1, stdin is empty, n is q, m is the minimum of the original m and k, k is the same as the original k, L is a list of three integers n, m, and k, M is a sorted list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. If n * m equals k, then N is a list of the q smallest integers from M, q is the ceiling of k/m, and cost is m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2). Otherwise, N is a list of the q-1 smallest integers from M, q is the ceiling of k/m, w is the largest integer from N, mu is k - (n - 1) * m, and cost is mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu, and the cost is printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is a positive integer minus 1, _ is 2, stdin is empty, n is q if n * m equals k, otherwise n is the length of N, m is the minimum of the original m and k, k is the same as the original k, L is a list of three integers n, m, and k, M is a sorted list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, N is a list of the q smallest integers from M if n * m equals k, otherwise N is a list of the q-1 smallest integers from M, q is the ceiling of k/m, w is the largest integer from N if n * m does not equal k, mu is k - (n - 1) * m if n * m does not equal k, and cost is m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) if n * m equals k, otherwise cost is mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
