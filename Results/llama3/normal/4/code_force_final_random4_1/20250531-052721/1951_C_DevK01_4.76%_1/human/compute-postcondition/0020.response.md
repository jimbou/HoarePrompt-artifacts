Output State: **t is a positive integer minus 1, _ is 2, stdin is empty, n is q, m is the minimum of the original m and k, k is the same as the original k, L is a list of three integers n, m, and k, M is a sorted list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. If n * m equals k, then N is a list of the q smallest integers from M, q is the ceiling of k/m, and cost is m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2). Otherwise, N is a list of the q-1 smallest integers from M, q is the ceiling of k/m, w is the largest integer from N, mu is k - (n - 1) * m, and cost is mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu, and the cost is printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `L`, and `M` remain unchanged from the initial state. The value of `q` is updated to be the ceiling of `k/m`, and the value of `N` is updated to be a list of the `q` smallest integers from `M`. If `n * m` equals `k`, then the value of `cost` is updated to be `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Otherwise, the value of `cost` is updated to be `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`, where `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m` and `w` is the largest integer from `N`.
