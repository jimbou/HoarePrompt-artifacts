Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets based on the given problem description. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases (t) and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of sale days (n), the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day (m), and the number of tickets to be bought at the end (k).
3. It then reads the prices per ticket for each of the upcoming n days (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n) and sorts them in ascending order.
4. The program calculates the minimum cost by selecting the smallest q integers (where q is the ceiling of k/m) and applying a formula that depends on whether n * m equals k or not.
5. If n * m equals k, the cost is calculated as m times the sum of the selected integers plus m squared times the sum of the first n-1 positive integers.
6. If n * m does not equal k, the program removes the last integer from the selected list, calculates the cost for the remaining integers, and adds the cost of the removed integer times the remaining number of tickets to be bought.
7. The program prints the calculated cost for each test case.

The execution summary confirms that the program processes all test cases and empties the standard input, which is consistent with the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
