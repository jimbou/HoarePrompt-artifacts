Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is the length of the list `N`, `m` is the minimum of the original `m` and `k`, `k` is the same as the original `k`, `L` is a list of three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, `M` is a sorted list of `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n`, `N` is a list of the `q` smallest integers from `M`, `q` is the ceiling of `k/m`, `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1.**

In this output state, the value of `cost` is calculated based on the given variables `m`, `N`, `n`, and the formula provided in the code. The other variables remain unchanged, and their values are still valid as specified in the initial state. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 1.
