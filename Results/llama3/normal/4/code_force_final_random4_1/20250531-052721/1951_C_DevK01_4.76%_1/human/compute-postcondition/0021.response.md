Output State: **`t` is a positive integer minus 1, `_` is 2, `n` is `q`, `m` is the minimum of the original `m` and `k`, `k` is the same as the original `k`, `L` is a list of three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, `M` is a sorted list of `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n`, `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`, `N` is a list of the `q` smallest integers from `M` if `n * m` equals `k`, otherwise `N` is a list of the `q-1` smallest integers from `M`, `q` is the ceiling of `k/m`, `w` is the largest integer from `N` if `n * m` does not equal `k`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m` if `n * m` does not equal `k`, and the cost is printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` remains a positive integer minus 1, `_` is still 2, `n` is still `q`, `m` is still the minimum of the original `m` and `k`, `k` is still the same as the original `k`, `L` is still a list of three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, `M` is still a sorted list of `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n`. The cost is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` and assigned to the variable `cost`. If `n * m` equals `k`, then `N` is a list of the `q` smallest integers from `M`, otherwise `N` is a list of the `q-1` smallest integers from `M`. `q` is the ceiling of `k/m`. If `n * m` does not equal `k`, then `w` is the largest integer from `N` and `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`. The cost is printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
