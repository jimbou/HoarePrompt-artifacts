The only variable in the loop head is variable `j` and `b`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `b` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, which ensures that the loop will execute. So, we only need to adjust `j` to be 0, since it will start from 0 in the range.

State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `b` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `c` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `d` is a binary string of length between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `e` is a binary string of length between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `k` is 0, `j` is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases.**
