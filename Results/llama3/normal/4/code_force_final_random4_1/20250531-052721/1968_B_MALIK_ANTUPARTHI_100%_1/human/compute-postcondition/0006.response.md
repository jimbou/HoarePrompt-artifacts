Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `b` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `c` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `d` is a binary string of length between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `e` is a binary string of length between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `k` is the index of the first occurrence of `d[j]` in the substring of `e` starting from index `k` plus 1 plus the previous value of `k`, `j` is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases. The current value of `k` is either equal to `c` or the current value of `j` is equal to `b - 1`***
