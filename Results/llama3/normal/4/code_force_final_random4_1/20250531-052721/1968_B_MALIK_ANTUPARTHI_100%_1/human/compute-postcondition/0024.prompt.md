Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 0, b is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, c is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, d is a binary string of length between 1 and 2 * 10^5, e is a binary string of length between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(b):
    if d[j] in e[k:]:
        k = e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k
        if k == c or j == b - 1:
            k = j + 1
            break
    else:
        k = j
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `b` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `c` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `d` is a binary string of length between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `e` is a binary string of length between 1 and 2 * 10^5. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, then if `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b` minus 1, `k` is set to `j` plus 1 and `j` is set to 0. Otherwise, the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `i`, `j`, `k` remain unchanged. If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, then `k` is equal to `j`, `j` is 0, and stdin contains t-2 test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *a is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 0, b is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, c is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, d is a binary string of length between 1 and 2 * 10^5, e is a binary string of length between 1 and 2 * 10^5, j is 1. If d[j] is in e[k:], then if k is equal to c or j is equal to b - 1, k is 2. Otherwise, the values of a, b, c, d, e, i, j, and k remain unchanged. If d[j] is not in e[k:], then k is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *a is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 0, b is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5, c is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, d is a binary string of length between 1 and 2 * 10^5, e is a binary string of length between 1 and 2 * 10^5, j is 2. If d[j] is in e[k:], then if k is equal to c or j is equal to b - 1, k is 3. Otherwise, the values of the variables remain unchanged. If d[j] is not in e[k:], then k is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
