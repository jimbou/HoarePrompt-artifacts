Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `i` is 2, `b` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5, `c` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `d` is a binary string of length between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `e` is a binary string of length between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `j` is 3. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, then if `k` is equal to `c` or `j` is equal to `b - 1`, `k` is 4. Otherwise, the values of `k` and `j` are unchanged. If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, then `k` is 3.***
