Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `b` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `c` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `d` is a binary string of length between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `e` is a binary string of length between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `k` is the index of the first occurrence of `d[j]` in the substring of `e` starting from index `k` plus 1 plus the previous value of `k`, `j` is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated to be the index of the first occurrence of `d[j]` in the substring of `e` starting from index `k`, plus 1, plus the previous value of `k`. This means that `k` now points to the position in `e` where the character `d[j]` is found, relative to the previous position of `k`. The other variables remain unchanged.
