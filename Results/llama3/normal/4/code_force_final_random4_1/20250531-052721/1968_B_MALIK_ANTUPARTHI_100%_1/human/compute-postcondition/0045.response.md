Output State: **a is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 1, b is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5, c is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, d is a binary string of length between 1 and 2 * 10^5, e is a binary string of length between 1 and 2 * 10^5. If d[j] is in e[k:], then if k equals c or j equals b - 1, k is j + 1. Otherwise, the values of k, j remain unchanged. If d[j] is not in e[k:], then j is 0 and k is 0. k is now the index of d[j] in e[k:] plus 1 plus the old value of k.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of k is updated to be the index of d[j] in the substring of e starting from the old value of k, plus 1, plus the old value of k. The values of a, i, b, c, d, and e remain unchanged.
