Postcondition: ***a is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 1, b is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, c is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, d is a binary string of length between 1 and 2 * 10^5, e is a binary string of length between 1 and 2 * 10^5. If d[j] is in e[k:], then if k equals c or j equals b - 1, k is j + 1. Otherwise, the values of k, j remain unchanged. If d[j] is not in e[k:], then j is 0 and k is 0.***
