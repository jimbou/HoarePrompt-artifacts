Postcondition: ***a is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 0, b is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5, c is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, d is a binary string of length between 1 and 2 * 10^5, e is a binary string of length between 1 and 2 * 10^5, j is 2. If d[j] is in e[k:], then if k is equal to c or j is equal to b - 1, k is 3. Otherwise, the values of the variables remain unchanged. If d[j] is not in e[k:], then k is 2.***
