Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `i` is 2, `b` is an integer between 4 and 2 * 10^5, `c` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `d` is a binary string of length between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `e` is a binary string of length between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `j` is 4. If `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b` minus 1, then `k` is 5. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
