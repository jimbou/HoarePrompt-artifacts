Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 1, `b` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `c` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `d` is a binary string of length between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `e` is a binary string of length between 1 and 2 * 10^5. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, then if `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, `j` is 0 and `k` is 1. Otherwise, the values of `j` and `k` remain unchanged. If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, then `j` is 0 and `k` is 0.***
