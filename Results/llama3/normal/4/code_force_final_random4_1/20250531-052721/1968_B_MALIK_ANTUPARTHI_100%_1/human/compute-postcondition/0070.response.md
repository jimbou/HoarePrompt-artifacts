The only variable in the loop head is variable `j` and `b`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `b`. If `j` is less than `b`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3, `b` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5. For the loop to execute again `j` is increased by 1 so `j` is 4 and for the loop to execute again `b` must be greater than 4.
State: **`a` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `i` is 2, `b` is an integer between 4 and 2 * 10^5, `c` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `d` is a binary string of length between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `e` is a binary string of length between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `j` is 4**
