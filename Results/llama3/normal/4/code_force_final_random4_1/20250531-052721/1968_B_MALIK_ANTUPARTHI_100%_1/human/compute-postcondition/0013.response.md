Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `b` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, `c` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `d` is a binary string of length between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `e` is a binary string of length between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `j` is 1, `k` is equal to the index of the first occurrence of `d[1]` in `e` plus 2.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated to be equal to the index of the first occurrence of `d[1]` in `e` plus 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
