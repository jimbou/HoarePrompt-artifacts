According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `j` is `b`, so for the loop to execute, `j` must be 0 and `b` must be greater than 0.

State: **`a` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `i` is 2, `b` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `c` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `d` is a binary string of length between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `e` is a binary string of length between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `j` is 0, `k` is 0**
