Based on the initial state, the variable `k` is assigned the value of `b`, which is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5.

When the `print(k)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `k`, which is the same as the value of `b`.

Output: **an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (which is the value of b)**
