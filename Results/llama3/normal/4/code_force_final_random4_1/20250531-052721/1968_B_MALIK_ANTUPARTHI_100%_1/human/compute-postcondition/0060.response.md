Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `i` is 2, `b` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `c` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `d` is a binary string of length between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `e` is a binary string of length between 1 and 2 * 10^5. If `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, then `j` is 0 and `k` is equal to `j + 1`. Otherwise, the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged.***
