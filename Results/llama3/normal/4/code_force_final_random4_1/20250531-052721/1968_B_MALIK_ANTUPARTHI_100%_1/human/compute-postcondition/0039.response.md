Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 1, `b` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, `c` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `d` is a binary string of length between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `e` is a binary string of length between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `k` is the index of `d[j]` in `e[k:]` plus 1 plus the original value of `k`. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, then `k` is updated to its new value. If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, then `k` is 0. The values of `j` remain unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `a`, `i`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e` remain the same. The value of `k` is updated to the index of `d[j]` in `e[k:]` plus 1 plus the original value of `k`, but only if `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`. If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, then `k` becomes 0. The value of `j` does not change.
