Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 1, `b` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `c` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `d` is a binary string of length between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `e` is a binary string of length between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `j` is 0, `k` is the index of the first occurrence of the character at index `j` in string `d` in the substring of `e` starting from index `k` plus 1 plus `k`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, and `j` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `k` is updated to be the index of the first occurrence of the character at index `j` in string `d` in the substring of `e` starting from index `k`, plus 1 plus `k`. This means that `k` now points to the position right after the first occurrence of the character at index `j` in string `d` in the substring of `e` starting from index `k`.
