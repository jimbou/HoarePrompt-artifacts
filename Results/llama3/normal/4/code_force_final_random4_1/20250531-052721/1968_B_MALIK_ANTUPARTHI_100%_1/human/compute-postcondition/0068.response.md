Output State: **a is an integer between 2 and 10^4, i is 2, b is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5, c is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, d is a binary string of length between 1 and 2 * 10^5, e is a binary string of length between 1 and 2 * 10^5, j is 3, k is 3**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `k = j` and `break`. The first line assigns the value of `j` to `k`, making `k` equal to 3. The second line, `break`, is a control flow statement that terminates the loop or switch statement it is enclosed in. However, since there is no loop or switch statement in the provided code snippet, the `break` statement has no effect. 

Therefore, the only change in the output state is that `k` is now 3, which was previously an integer between 0 and 2 * 10^5. All other variables remain unchanged.
