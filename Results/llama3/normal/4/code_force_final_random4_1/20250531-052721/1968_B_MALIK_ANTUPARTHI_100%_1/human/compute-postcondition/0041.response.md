Postcondition: ***a is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 1, b is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, c is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, d is a binary string of length between 1 and 2 * 10^5, e is a binary string of length between 1 and 2 * 10^5. If k equals c or j equals b - 1, then k is j + 1. Otherwise, the values of k, j remain unchanged.***
