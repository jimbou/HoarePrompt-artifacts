The only variable in the loop head is variable `j` and `b`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `b`. If `j` is less than `b`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `b` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5. For the loop to execute again `j` is increased by 1 so `j` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `b` must be greater than 2.
State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 1, `b` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, `c` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `d` is a binary string of length between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `e` is a binary string of length between 1 and 2 * 10^5. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, then if `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, `j` is 0 and `k` is 1. Otherwise, the values of `j` and `k` remain unchanged. If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, then `j` is 0 and `k` is 0.**
