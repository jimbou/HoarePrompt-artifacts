Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `b` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `c` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `d` is a binary string of length between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `e` is a binary string of length between 1 and 2 * 10^5. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, then if `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b` minus 1, `k` is set to `j` plus 1 and `j` is set to 0. Otherwise, the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `i`, `j`, `k` remain unchanged. If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, then `k` is equal to `j`, `j` is 0, and stdin contains t-2 test cases.***
