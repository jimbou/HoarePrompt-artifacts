Based on the precondition, the value of `k` is `b - 1`, where `b` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5.

Since `b` can take any value within this range, we cannot determine the exact value of `k`. However, we can describe its value as `b - 1`, where `b` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5.

Output: **b - 1 (where b is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5)**
