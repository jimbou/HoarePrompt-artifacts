Output State: **`a` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `i` is 2, `b` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5, `c` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `d` is a binary string of length between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `e` is a binary string of length between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `j` is 3, `k` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and is equal to the index of `d[j]` in `e[k:]` plus 1 plus the old value of `k`.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated to be the index of `d[j]` in `e[k:]` plus 1 plus the old value of `k`. The other variables remain unchanged. The new value of `k` is at least 1 because the index of `d[j]` in `e[k:]` is at least 0, and we add 1 and the old value of `k` which is at least 0. The new value of `k` is at most 2 * 10^5 because the length of `e` is at most 2 * 10^5, and we are adding at most the length of `e` to the old value of `k` which is at most 2 * 10^5.
