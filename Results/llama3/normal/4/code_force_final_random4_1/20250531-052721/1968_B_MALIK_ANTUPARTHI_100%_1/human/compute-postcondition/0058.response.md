Postcondition: **`a` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `i` is 2, `b` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `c` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `d` is a binary string of length between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `e` is a binary string of length between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `j` is 0, `k` is equal to the index of the first occurrence of `d[j]` in the substring of `e` starting from index `k` plus 1 plus `k`. The current value of `k` is either equal to `c` or the current value of `j` is equal to `b - 1`.**
