Output State: **`a` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `i` is 2, `b` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `c` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `d` is a binary string of length between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `e` is a binary string of length between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `j` is 0, `k` is equal to the index of the first occurrence of `d[j]` in the substring of `e` starting from index `k` plus 1 plus `k`**.

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `k` has been updated to be the index of the first occurrence of the character at index `j` in string `d` within the substring of `e` starting from index `k`, plus 1 plus the original value of `k`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
