Reasoning: 

The problem requires determining the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants according to their preferences. The given program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2.

func_1 takes two non-negative integers, extroverts and universals, as input. It first checks if the sum of extroverts modulo 3 and universals is less than 3 when extroverts is not divisible by 3. If this condition is true, it returns None, indicating that it is impossible to accommodate the participants. Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the sum of extroverts and universals divided by 3, which represents the number of complete sets of three people that can be formed.

func_2 takes three non-negative integers (introverts, extroverts, and universals) as input. It calls func_1 with extroverts and universals as arguments and checks the return value. If func_1 returns None, func_2 returns -1, indicating that it is impossible to accommodate the participants. Otherwise, it returns the sum of introverts and the result of calling func_1, which represents the total number of tents needed.

The given program correctly implements the problem description. It respects the wishes of each participant by accommodating introverts alone, extroverts in groups of three, and universals in any option. The program also handles cases where it is impossible to accommodate the participants, returning -1 in such cases.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
