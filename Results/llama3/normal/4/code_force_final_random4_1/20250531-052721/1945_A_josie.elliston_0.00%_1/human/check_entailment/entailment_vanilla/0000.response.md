Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants according to their preferences. The given program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` takes the number of extroverts and universals as input and returns the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate them. It first checks if the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3. If it's not, it checks if the remaining extroverts (i.e., `extroverts % 3`) plus the number of universals is less than 3. If it is, it returns `None`, indicating that it's impossible to accommodate the participants. Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the total number of extroverts and universals divided by 3, which represents the minimum number of tents needed.

`func_2` takes the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals as input and returns the total minimum number of tents needed. It calls `func_1` with the number of extroverts and universals and adds the number of introverts to the result. If `func_1` returns `None`, it returns -1, indicating that it's impossible to accommodate the participants.

The program correctly handles the following cases:

* Introverts: Each introvert needs a separate tent, so the number of introverts is added to the total number of tents.
* Extroverts: Each extrovert needs to be in a tent with two others. If the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3, the remaining extroverts are accommodated with universals. If there are not enough universals, it's impossible to accommodate the participants.
* Universals: Universals can be accommodated in any tent, so they are used to fill the remaining spaces in tents with extroverts.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the number of extroverts is 0 or when the number of universals is 0.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
