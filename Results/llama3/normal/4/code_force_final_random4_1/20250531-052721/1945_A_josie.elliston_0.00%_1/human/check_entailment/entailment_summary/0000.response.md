Reasoning: 
The problem requires determining the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants according to their preferences. The given program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2. 

func_1 takes two non-negative integers, extroverts and universals, as input and returns the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate them. It first checks if the sum of extroverts modulo 3 and universals is less than 3 when extroverts is not divisible by 3. If this condition is true, it returns None, indicating that it is impossible to accommodate the participants. Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the sum of extroverts and universals divided by 3, which represents the minimum number of tents needed.

func_2 takes three non-negative integers (introverts, extroverts, and universals) as input and returns either -1 or the sum of introverts and the result of calling func_1 with extroverts and universals as arguments. If func_1 returns None, func_2 returns -1, indicating that it is impossible to accommodate the participants. Otherwise, it returns the sum of introverts and the result of func_1, which represents the total minimum number of tents needed.

The given program correctly implements the problem's requirements. It first checks if it is possible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, and if not, it returns -1. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum number of tents needed for the extroverts and universals, and then adds the number of introverts to get the total minimum number of tents needed.

Correctness: **True**
