Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly calculates the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants according to their preferences.

The program uses two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals, and `func_2` adds the number of tents needed for introverts to the result of `func_1`.

`func_1` correctly handles the case where the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3. If the remaining extroverts (i.e., `extroverts % 3`) plus the number of universals is less than 3, it returns `None`, indicating that it is impossible to accommodate the participants. Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the total number of extroverts and universals divided by 3, which is the minimum number of tents needed.

`func_2` simply adds the number of introverts to the result of `func_1`. If `func_1` returns `None`, it returns -1, indicating that it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where the number of introverts, extroverts, or universals is 0. It also correctly handles the case where the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3.

Therefore, the program is correct, and the answer is **True**.
