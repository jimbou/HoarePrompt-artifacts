Functionality: **This function takes two non-negative integers, extroverts and universals, as input. If the sum of extroverts modulo 3 and universals is less than 3 when extroverts is not divisible by 3, the function returns None. Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the sum of extroverts and universals divided by 3. The function effectively groups extroverts and universals into sets of three, returning the number of complete sets, and if there are any remaining individuals, it counts them as a separate set.**
