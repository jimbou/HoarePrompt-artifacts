Output State: **`introverts` is a non-negative integer, `extroverts` is a non-negative integer, `universals` is a non-negative integer, `ret` is the value returned by `func_1(extroverts, universals)`**

In this output state, the values of `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals` remain unchanged as non-negative integers. The variable `ret` is assigned the value returned by the function `func_1` when called with the arguments `extroverts` and `universals`. The exact value of `ret` depends on the implementation of `func_1`, which is not provided.
