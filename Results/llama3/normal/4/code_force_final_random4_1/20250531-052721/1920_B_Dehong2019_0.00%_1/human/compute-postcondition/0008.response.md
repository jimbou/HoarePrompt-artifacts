Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the first integer in `a` minus twice the second integer in `a` minus twice the third integer in `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `x` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans1` has been updated by subtracting twice the third integer in the list `a` from its previous value. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
