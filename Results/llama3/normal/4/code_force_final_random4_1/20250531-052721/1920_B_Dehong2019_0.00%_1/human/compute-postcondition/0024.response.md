Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers in descending order, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `x` is an integer, `i` is 2, and `ans1` is increased by `a[1]` plus `a[2]` minus twice `a[i + x]` if `i + x` is less than `n`, otherwise `ans1` is increased by `a[1]` plus `a[2]` minus twice `a[i + x]`**

The code decreases the value of `ans1` by twice the value of `a[i + x]`. Since `i` is 2 and `x` is an integer, `i + x` is an integer greater than or equal to 2. If `i + x` is less than `n`, then `ans1` is increased by `a[1]` plus `a[2]` minus twice `a[i + x]`. Otherwise, `ans1` is increased by `a[1]` plus `a[2]` minus twice `a[i + x]`. The values of the other variables are not affected.
