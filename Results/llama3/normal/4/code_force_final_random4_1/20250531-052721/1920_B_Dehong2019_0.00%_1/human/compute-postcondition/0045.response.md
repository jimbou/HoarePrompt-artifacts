Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers in descending order, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a` plus `a[0]`, `i` is 0, `x` is an integer, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If the current value of `i` plus `x` is less than `n`, then `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a` plus `a[0]` minus 2 times the value of the integer at index `i + x` in `a`.***
