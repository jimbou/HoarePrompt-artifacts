Output State: **t is an integer greater than or equal to 0, _ is t-1, n is an integer, k is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of n integers in descending order, ans is the maximum of ans1 and ans2, stdin contains no test cases, x is an integer, i is k-1, ans1 is the sum of the integers in a minus twice the sum of the x largest integers in a plus the sum of the first k integers in a minus 2 times the sum of the integers at indices i + x in a where i ranges from 0 to k-1 if k+x-1 is less than n, otherwise ans1 is the sum of the integers in a minus twice the sum of the x largest integers in a plus the sum of the first k integers in a, ans2 is the sum of the integers in a minus twice the sum of the x largest integers in a, and the maximum of ans1 and ans2 is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing all the test cases in the input. The variable `_` has reached its final value of `t-1`, indicating that the loop has executed `t` times. The variables `n`, `k`, `a`, `x`, `i`, `ans1`, `ans2`, and `ans` have their final values after the last iteration of the loop. The input has been fully processed, and there are no more test cases left in `stdin`. The final maximum value of `ans1` and `ans2` has been printed.
