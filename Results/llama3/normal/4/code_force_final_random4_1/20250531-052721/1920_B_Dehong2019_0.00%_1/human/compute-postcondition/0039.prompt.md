Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of n integers in descending order, ans is the maximum of ans1 and ans2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, x is an integer, i is k-1, ans1 is the sum of the integers in a, and the maximum of ans1 and ans2 is printed
Code of the loop:
for i in range(x):
    ans1 -= a[i] * 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers in descending order, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the largest integer in `a`, `i` is 0, `x` is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers in descending order, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the largest integer in `a` minus twice the second largest integer in `a`, `i` is 1, `x` is at least 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers in descending order, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the largest integer in `a` minus twice the second largest integer in `a` minus twice the third largest integer in `a`, `i` is 2, `x` is at least 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
