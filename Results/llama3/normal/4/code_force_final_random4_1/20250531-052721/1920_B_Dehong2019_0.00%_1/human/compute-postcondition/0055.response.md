Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers in descending order, `ans` is the maximum of the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a` plus `a[0]` minus 2 times the value of the integer at index `i + x` in `a` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a` plus `a[0]` minus 4 times the value of the integer at index `i + x` in `a` plus `a[i]`, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`, `i` is 2, `x` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three. If `i + x` is less than `n`, then `ans` is updated to include `a[i]` minus 2 times the value of the integer at index `i + x` in `a`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
