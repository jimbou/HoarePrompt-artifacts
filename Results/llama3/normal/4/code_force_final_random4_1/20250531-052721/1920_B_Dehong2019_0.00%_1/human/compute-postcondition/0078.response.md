Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a` plus `a[0]` plus `a[1]` minus twice `a[i + x]`, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans1` has been updated by subtracting twice the value of `a[i + x]` from its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still 1, and the list `a` is still in descending order. The values of `n`, `k`, `x`, `t`, and `_` are unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two.
