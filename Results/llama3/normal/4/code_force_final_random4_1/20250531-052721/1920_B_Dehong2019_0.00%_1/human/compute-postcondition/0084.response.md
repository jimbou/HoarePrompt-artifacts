Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a` plus `a[0]` plus `a[1]` plus `a[2]`, `i` is 2, `t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2` after updating `ans1` by subtracting twice `a[i + x]` if `i + x` is less than `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If `i + x` is less than `n`, `ans1` is updated by subtracting twice `a[i + x]`.**
