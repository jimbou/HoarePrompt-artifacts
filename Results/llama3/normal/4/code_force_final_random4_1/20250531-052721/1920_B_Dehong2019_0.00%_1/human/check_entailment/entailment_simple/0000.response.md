Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the strategy for Alice and Bob to play optimally. 

Alice's strategy is to remove the k largest numbers from the array, and Bob's strategy is to multiply the x largest remaining numbers by -1. 

The program first calculates the sum of the array after Bob's move, assuming Alice doesn't remove any numbers (ans1). Then, it iteratively adds the k largest numbers back to the sum and subtracts the x largest remaining numbers multiplied by -1. 

The maximum sum obtained during this process is the optimal sum that Alice can achieve. 

The program correctly handles the edge cases where k or x is 0, and it also handles the case where k + x is greater than n.

Correctness: **True**
