Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers in descending order, `ans` is the maximum of the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a` plus `a[0]` minus 2 times the value of the integer at index `i + x` in `a` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a` plus `a[0]` minus 2 times the value of the integer at index `i + x` in `a`, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`, `i` is 0, `x` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`. The value of `ans1` is still the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a` plus `a[0]` minus 2 times the value of the integer at index `i + x` in `a`, and the value of `ans2` is still the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`. The values of the other variables remain the same.
