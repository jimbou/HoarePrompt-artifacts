Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers in descending order, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`, `i` is `x-1`, `x` is an integer, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In this output state, the value of `ans2` has been updated to be equal to `ans1`, which is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two.
