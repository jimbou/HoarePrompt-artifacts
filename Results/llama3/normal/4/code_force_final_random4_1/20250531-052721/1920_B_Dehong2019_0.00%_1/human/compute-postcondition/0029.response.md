Output: **The maximum of ans1 and ans2 (where ans1 is the sum of the integers in a minus twice the sum of the integers in the slice of a from index 0 to x-1 plus the sum of the integers in the slice of a from index 0 to k-1 minus twice the sum of the integers in the slice of a from index x to k+x-1 if k+x-1 is less than n, otherwise ans1 is the sum of the integers in a minus twice the sum of the integers in the slice of a from index 0 to x-1 plus the sum of the integers in the slice of a from index 0 to k-1, and ans2 is not defined in the initial state)**
