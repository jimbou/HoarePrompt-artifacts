Output State: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers in descending order, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `x` is an integer, and `i` is `k-1`. If `i + x` is less than `n`, then the current value of `i + x` is less than `n`. The value of `ans1` is increased by the sum of the integers in the slice of `a` from index 0 to `k-1` minus twice the sum of the integers in the slice of `a` from index `x` to `k+x-1`. Otherwise, `ans1` is increased by the sum of the integers in the slice of `a` from index 0 to `k-1`.
