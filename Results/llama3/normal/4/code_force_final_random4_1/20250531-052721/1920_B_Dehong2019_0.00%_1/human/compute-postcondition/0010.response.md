Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the integers in the slice of `a` from index 0 to `x-1`, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the integers in the slice of `a` from index 0 to `x-1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `x` is an integer, `i` is `x-1`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans2` has been updated to be equal to `ans1`, which is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the integers in the slice of `a` from index 0 to `x-1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
