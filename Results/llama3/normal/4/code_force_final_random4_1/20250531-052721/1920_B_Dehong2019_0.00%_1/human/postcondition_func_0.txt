This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: n, k, and x. The second line contains n integers. The function then calculates the maximum possible sum of the integers in each test case by subtracting twice the sum of the x largest integers and adding the sum of the integers up to index k-1, minus twice the sum of the integers from index x to k+x-1. It prints the maximum sum for each test case. The function processes all test cases and does not return any value.
