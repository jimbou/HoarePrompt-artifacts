Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers in descending order, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `x` is an integer, `i` is 2. If `i + x` is less than `n`, `ans1` is increased by `a[1]` plus `a[2]` minus twice `a[i + x]`. Otherwise, `ans1` is increased by `a[1]` plus `a[2]`.***
