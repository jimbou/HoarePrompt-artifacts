Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, k, and x, and the second line contains n integers. The function then calculates the maximum possible sum of the integers in each test case by applying certain operations, which involve subtracting twice the sum of the x largest integers and adding the sum of the first k integers, and prints the maximum sum for each test case. The function processes all test cases and prints the maximum sum for each case.**
