Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers in descending order, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the largest integer in `a` minus twice the second largest integer in `a` minus twice the third largest integer in `a`, `i` is 2, `x` is at least 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three**

The value of `ans1` is updated by subtracting twice the third largest integer in `a` (since `i` is 2 and `a` is in descending order). The other variables remain unchanged.
