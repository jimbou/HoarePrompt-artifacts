Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers in descending order, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a` plus `a[0]`, `i` is 0, `x` is an integer, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans1` has been updated by adding the first element of the list `a` to it. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still 0, indicating that only the first element of the list `a` has been processed so far.
