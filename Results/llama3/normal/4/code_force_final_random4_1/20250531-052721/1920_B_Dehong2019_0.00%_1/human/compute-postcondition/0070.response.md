To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `k`. The loop will execute if `k` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `i` is `x-1`, but for the loop to execute, `i` should be 0 (the starting value of the range). 

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`, `i` is 0, `t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `ans` is the maximum of the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a` plus the sum of the first `k` integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers at indices `i + x` in `a` where `i` ranges from 0 to `k-1` which is being printed**
