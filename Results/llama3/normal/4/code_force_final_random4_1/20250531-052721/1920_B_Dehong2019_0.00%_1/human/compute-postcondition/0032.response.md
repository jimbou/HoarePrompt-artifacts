Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of n integers in descending order, ans is the maximum of ans1 and ans2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, x is an integer, i is k-1, ans1 is the sum of the integers in a, and the maximum of ans1 and ans2 is printed**

The code snippet reads two lines of input from stdin, containing three integers (n, k, x) and a list of n integers, respectively. The list of integers is sorted in descending order and assigned to the variable 'a'. The variable 'ans1' is assigned the sum of all integers in the list 'a'. The variables 'n', 'k', and 'x' are updated with the values read from the input. The variable 'ans' remains unchanged as the maximum of 'ans1' and 'ans2', but 'ans1' is updated to be the sum of the integers in 'a'. The variable 'i' remains unchanged as k-1. Stdin now contains multiple test cases minus two.
