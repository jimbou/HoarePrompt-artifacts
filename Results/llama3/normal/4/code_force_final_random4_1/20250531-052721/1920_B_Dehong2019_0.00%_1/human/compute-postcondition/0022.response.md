To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `k`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `k` is an integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `k` remains the same.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers in descending order, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `x` is an integer, `i` is 2, and `ans1` is increased by `a[1]` minus twice `a[i + x]` if `i + x` is less than `n`, otherwise `ans1` is increased by `a[1]`.**
