To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t` and the variable `_` in the loop head.


According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer equal to the number of test cases, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and `_` is now 0.


State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, k, and x. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.**
