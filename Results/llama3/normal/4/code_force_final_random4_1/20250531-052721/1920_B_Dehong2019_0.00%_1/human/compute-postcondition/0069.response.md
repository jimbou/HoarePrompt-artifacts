Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`, `i` is `x-1`, `t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `ans` is the maximum of the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a` plus the sum of the first `k` integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers at indices `i + x` in `a` where `i` ranges from 0 to `k-1` which is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that `ans2` is now equal to `ans1`, which is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
