Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers in descending order, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a` plus `a[0]` minus 2 times the value of the integer at index `i + x` in `a`, `i` is 0, `x` is an integer, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. The current value of `i` plus `x` is less than `n`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans1` has been updated by subtracting twice the value of the integer at index `i + x` in the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` is still in descending order, and the relationship between `ans`, `ans1`, and `ans2` remains the same. The value of `i` is still 0, and the current value of `i` plus `x` is still less than `n`.
