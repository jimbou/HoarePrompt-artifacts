Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers in descending order, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the largest integer in `a` minus twice the second largest integer in `a`, `i` is 1, `x` is at least 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In this output state, the value of `ans1` has been updated by subtracting twice the second largest integer in `a` (since `a` is in descending order, `a[i]` is the second largest integer). The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
