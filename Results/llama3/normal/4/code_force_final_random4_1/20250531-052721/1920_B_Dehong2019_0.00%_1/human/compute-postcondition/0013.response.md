Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the integers in the slice of `a` from index 0 to `x-1` plus `a[0]`, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the integers in the slice of `a` from index 0 to `x-1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `x` is an integer, `i` is 0, and the current value of `i + x` is less than `n`.**
