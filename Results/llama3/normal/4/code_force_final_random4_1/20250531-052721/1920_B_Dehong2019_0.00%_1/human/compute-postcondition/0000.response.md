The code reads the number of test cases from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This means that the first line of each test case, which contains three integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, is not read yet. The second line of each test case, which contains `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n`, is also not read yet.

Output State: **t is an integer equal to the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, k, and x. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.**
