Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `x` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the integer at index `i+1` in `a` minus twice the integer at index `i` in `a` minus twice the integer at index `i` in `a`, `i` is 2, `t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `ans` is the maximum of the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a` plus the sum of the first `k` integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers at indices `i + x` in `a` where `i` ranges from 0 to `k-1` which is being printed, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans1` has been updated to be the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the integer at index `i+1` in `a` minus twice the integer at index `i` in `a` minus twice the integer at index `i` in `a`, which is equivalent to the original value of `ans1` minus twice the integer at index `i` in `a`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
