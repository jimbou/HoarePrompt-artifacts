Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers in descending order, `ans` is the maximum of the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the integers in the slice of `a` from index 0 to `x` plus `a[0]` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the integers in the slice of `a` from index 0 to `x-1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `x` is an integer, `i` is 1, and `ans1` is increased by `a[1]` minus twice `a[i + x]`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `ans1` has been updated to be increased by `a[1]` minus twice `a[i + x]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
