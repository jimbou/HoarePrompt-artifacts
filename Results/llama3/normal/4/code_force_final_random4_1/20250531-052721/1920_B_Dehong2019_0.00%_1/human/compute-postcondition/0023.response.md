Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers in descending order, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `x` is an integer, `i` is 2, and `ans1` is increased by `a[1]` plus `a[2]` minus twice `a[i + x]` if `i + x` is less than `n`, otherwise `ans1` is increased by `a[1]` plus `a[2]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` is still greater than 0, `_` remains 0, `n` and `k` are still integers with `k` being greater than 0, `a` is still a list of `n` integers in descending order, `ans` is still the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, there is one less test case in `stdin`, `x` is still an integer, `i` is still 2, and `ans1` has been increased by the value of `a[2]` because `i` is 2 and `a` is a list of `n` integers in descending order.
