Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers in descending order, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `x` is an integer, `i` is `k-1`, and `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the integers in the slice of `a` from index 0 to `x-1` plus the sum of the integers in the slice of `a` from index 0 to `k-1` minus twice the sum of the integers in the slice of `a` from index `x` to `k+x-1` if `k+x-1` is less than `n`, otherwise `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the integers in the slice of `a` from index 0 to `x-1` plus the sum of the integers in the slice of `a` from index 0 to `k-1`.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the variables in the loop head and body. The variable `i` is now `k-1`, and `ans1` has been updated to include the sum of the integers in the slice of `a` from index 0 to `k-1` minus twice the sum of the integers in the slice of `a` from index `x` to `k+x-1` if `k+x-1` is less than `n`, otherwise `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the integers in the slice of `a` from index 0 to `x-1` plus the sum of the integers in the slice of `a` from index 0 to `k-1`. The variable `ans` is still the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.
