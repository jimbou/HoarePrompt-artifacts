Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers in descending order, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`, `i` is `x-1`, `x` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `ans1` will be the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`. The value of `i` will be `x-1`, indicating that the loop has executed `x` times. The other variables remain unchanged.
