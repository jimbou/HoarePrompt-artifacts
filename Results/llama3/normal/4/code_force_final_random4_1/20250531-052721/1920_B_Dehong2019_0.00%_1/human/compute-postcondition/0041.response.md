The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers in descending order, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`, `i` is `x-1`, `x` is an integer, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `k` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0. 
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers in descending order, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`, `i` is 0, `x` is an integer, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two**
