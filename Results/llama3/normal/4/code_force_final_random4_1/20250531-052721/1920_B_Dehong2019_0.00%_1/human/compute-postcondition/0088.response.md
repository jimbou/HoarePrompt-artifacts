Output: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a` plus the sum of the first `k` integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers at indices `i + x` in `a` where `i` ranges from 0 to `k-1`, `i` is `k-1`, `t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2` after updating `ans1` by subtracting twice `a[i + x]` if `i + x` is less than `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, and the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2` is being printed**
