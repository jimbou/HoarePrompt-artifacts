Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a` plus `a[0]`, `i` is 0, `t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

The code assigns `ans` the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The state of `ans` is updated to be the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.
