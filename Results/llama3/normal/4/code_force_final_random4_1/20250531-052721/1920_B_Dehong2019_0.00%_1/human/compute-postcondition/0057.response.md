Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers in descending order, `ans` is the maximum of the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a` plus the sum of the first `k` integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers at indices `i + x` in `a` where `i` ranges from 0 to `k-1`, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a` plus the sum of the first `k` integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers at indices `i + x` in `a` where `i` ranges from 0 to `k-1`, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`, `i` is `k-1`, `x` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop has executed `k` times. The value of `ans` is the maximum of the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a` plus the sum of the first `k` integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers at indices `i + x` in `a` where `i` ranges from 0 to `k-1`. The value of `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a` plus the sum of the first `k` integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers at indices `i + x` in `a` where `i` ranges from 0 to `k-1`. The value of `ans2` remains the same as the initial state. The value of `i` is `k-1`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
