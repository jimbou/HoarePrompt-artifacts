Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a` plus `a[0]` plus `a[1]` plus `a[2]` minus twice `a[i + x]` if `i + x` is less than `n`, `i` is 2, `t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2` after updating `ans1` by subtracting twice `a[i + x]` if `i + x` is less than `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `i`, `t`, and `_` remain the same. The value of `ans1` is updated by subtracting twice the value of `a[i + x]` if `i + x` is less than `n`. The values of `ans2` and `ans` are not changed. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two.
