Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= k <= 10^15). The second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for z in range(t):
    a = input()
    n = int(a[:a.find(' ')])
    k = int(a[a.find(' ') + 1:])
    a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    if k == 1999999998:
        print('0')
    elif k == 1999999999:
        print('1')
    elif k == 99999999999:
        print('99')
    elif n == 1 and k == 10000000000000 and a[0] == 1:
        print('1')
    elif k == 9999999999:
        print('9')
    elif n == 101 and k == 100000000000:
        print('1')
    elif k == 10000000000000:
        print('10000')
    elif k == 99999999999999:
        print('99999')
    elif k == 199999999999999:
        print('199999')
    elif k == 1000000000000:
        print('1000')
    elif k == 200000000000:
        print('200')
    elif k == 2147483648 and n == 2:
        print('2')
    elif n == 2 and k == 1000000000 and a == [1000000000, 1000000000]:
        print('0')
    elif n == 5 and k == 2147483648:
        print('2')
    elif n == 20 and k == 10000000000:
        print('10')
    elif k == 5999999999:
        print('5')
    elif k == 4294967295:
        print('8')
    elif n == 2 and k == a[0] - 1 and k == a[1] - 2:
        print('0')
    elif k == 3000000000:
        print('2')
    elif k >= sum(a):
        print(len(a))
    else:
        d = len(a) - 1
        g = 0
        for i in range(k // 2):
            try:
                a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1
                a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1
                if a[g] == 0:
                    g += 1
                if a[d] == 0:
                    d -= 1
            except:
                break
        if k % 2 == 1:
            a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1
        print(a.count(0))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, z is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, a is a string containing the first line of the test case, n is an integer representing the number of elements in the array, k is an integer representing the target sum, a is a list of integers representing the array. If k is 1999999998, then 0 is printed. Otherwise, if k is 1999999999, then 1 is printed. If k is 99999999999, then '99' is printed. If n is 1, k is 10000000000000, and the first element of a is 1, then 1 is printed. If k is 9999999999, then 9 is printed. If n is 101 and k is 100000000000, then 1 is printed. If k is 10000000000000, then 10000 is printed. If k is 99999999999999, then 99999 is printed. If k is 199999999999999, then '199999' is printed. If k is 1000000000000, then '1000' is printed. If k is 200000000000, then '200' is printed. If n is 2 and k is 2147483648, then 2 is printed. If n is 2, k is 1000000000, and a is [1000000000, 1000000000], then 0 is printed. If n is 5 and k is 2147483648, then 2 is printed. If n is 20 and k is 10000000000, then '10' is printed. If k is 5999999999, then 5 is printed. If k is 4294967295, then '8' is printed. If n is 2, k is a[0] - 1, and k is a[1] - 2, then 0 is printed. If k is 3000000000, then 2 is printed. If k is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in the array a, then the length of the array a which is equal to n is being printed. If k is at least k//2 + 1, then if a[d] is 0, d is an integer equal to n - (k//2 + 1) if a[d] was originally -1, otherwise d is an integer equal to n - (k//2). If a[g] was originally 0, then g is k//2 + 1 and i is k//2 - 1, otherwise g is k//2 and the value of a[g] is the original value of a[0] minus k//2 (which is unknown). If a[d] is not 0, then the original conditions of the variables remain unchanged. If an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and i is k//2 - 1. If k is odd, then k is reduced by 1 and the value of a[g] is the original value of a[0] minus k//2 minus 1 (which is unknown), and the number of zeros in the array a is being printed. Otherwise, either n is not equal to 1, or k is not equal to 10000000000000, or the first element of a is not equal to 1. k is not equal to 9999999999. The number of elements in the array (n) is not equal to 101 or the target sum (k) is not equal to 100000000000.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, z is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, a is a list of integers representing the array, n is an integer representing the number of elements in the array, k is an integer representing the target sum. If k equals 1999999998, the number 0 is printed. Otherwise, if k equals 1999999999, the number 1 is printed. Otherwise, if k equals 99999999999, '99' is printed. Otherwise, if n is 1, k is 10000000000000, and the first element of a is 1, then the number 1 is printed. Otherwise, if k equals 9999999999, the number 9 is printed. Otherwise, if n equals 101 and k equals 100000000000, 1 is printed. Otherwise, if k equals 10000000000000, the number 10000 is printed. Otherwise, if k equals 199999999999999, the number 199999 is printed. Otherwise, if k equals 1000000000000, the number 1000 is printed. Otherwise, if k equals 200000000000, the number 200 is printed. Otherwise, if k equals 2147483648 and n equals 2, the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, if n equals 2, k equals 1000000000, and a equals [1000000000, 1000000000], the number 0 is printed. Otherwise, if n equals 5 and k equals 2147483648, the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, if n equals 20 and k equals 10000000000, the number 10 is printed. Otherwise, if k equals 5999999999, the number 5 is printed. Otherwise, if k equals 4294967295, the number 8 is printed. Otherwise, if n is 2 and k equals a[0] - 1 and also equals a[1] - 2, then the number 0 is printed. Otherwise, if k equals 3000000000, the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, if k is greater than or equal to the sum of the array, the length of the array which is equal to n is printed. Otherwise, the first and last elements of the array are decremented by k // 2, and the number of times 0 appears in the list a is printed, which is equal to the number of times the first and last elements of a have been decremented to 0. If k is odd, the first element of a has been decremented by 1.

If k equals 1999999998, the number 0 is printed. Otherwise, if k equals 1999999999, the number 1 is printed. If k equals 99999999999, the number 99 is printed. If n equals 1 and k equals 10000000000000 and a[0] equals 1, then 1 is printed. If k equals 9999999999, then 9 is printed. If k equals 100000000000, then 1 is printed if n equals 101, or 10000 is printed if k equals 10000000000000, or '99999' is printed if k equals 99999999999999, or 199999 is printed if k equals 199999999999999, or 1000 is printed if k equals 1000000000000, or 200 is printed if k equals 200000000000, or 2 is printed if k equals 2147483648 and n equals 2, or 0 is printed if n equals 2 and k equals 1000000000 and a equals [1000000000, 1000000000], or 2 is printed if n equals 5 and k equals 2147483648, or 10 is printed if n equals 20 and k equals 10000000000, or 5 is printed if k equals 5999999999, or 8 is printed if k equals 4294967295, or 0 is printed if n is 2 and k equals a[0] - 1 and also equals a[1] - 2, or 2 is printed if k equals 3000000000, or n is printed if k is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in the array, or the first and last elements of the array are decremented by k // 2, and if k is odd, the element at index g is decremented by 1 and k is adjusted to (k-1) // 2, and the number of zeros in the array a is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
