Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive, z is 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases, n is an integer representing the number of elements in the array, k is an integer representing the target sum and must be at least 4, a is a list of integers representing the array where the first and last elements are decremented by 2, d is an integer equal to the length of a minus 1, g is either 0 or 1, and i is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `t`, `z`, `n`, `k`, `d`, `g`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The only change occurs in the list `a`, where the first and last elements are decremented by 2 (1 in each line of the code). The rest of the information from the precondition remains valid.
