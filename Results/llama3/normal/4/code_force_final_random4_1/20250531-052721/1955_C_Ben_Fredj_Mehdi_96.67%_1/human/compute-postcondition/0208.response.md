Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, z is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, a is a list of integers representing the array with the first and last elements decremented by k // 2, n is an integer representing the number of elements in the array, k is an odd integer representing the target sum, d is an integer equal to n-1 minus the number of times the last element of a has been decremented to 0, g is equal to the number of times the first element of a has been decremented to 0, and i is equal to k // 2 - 1, unless an exception occurs, in which case the program breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement.**
