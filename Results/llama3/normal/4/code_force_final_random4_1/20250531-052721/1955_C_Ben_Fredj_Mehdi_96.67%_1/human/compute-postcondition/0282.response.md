Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive, `z` is 2, stdin contains `t-4` test cases, `n` is an integer representing the number of elements in the array, `k` is an integer representing the target sum and must be at least 2, `a` is a list of integers representing the array where the first and last elements are decremented by 1, `d` is an integer equal to the length of `a` minus 2, `g` is either 0 or 1, and `i` is 0. If the first element of `a` is 0, then `g` is 1, otherwise `g` remains 0. The current value of the last element of `a` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `d` has been decremented by 1, so it is now equal to the length of `a` minus 2. All other variables remain unchanged. The array `a` still has its first and last elements decremented by 1, and the last element is still 0. The value of `g` is still dependent on the first element of `a`. The number of test cases in stdin and the values of `t`, `z`, `n`, `k`, and `i` are unchanged.
