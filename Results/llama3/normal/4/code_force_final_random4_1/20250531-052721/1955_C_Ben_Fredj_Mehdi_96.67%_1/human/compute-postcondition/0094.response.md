The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and k, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k // 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is unknown, `k` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 and `k` must be at least 3.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `z` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `a` is a list of integers representing the array with `a[d]` decremented by 1, `n` is an integer representing the number of elements in the array, `k` is an integer representing the target sum and is at least 3. If `a[d]` is 0, then `d` is an integer equal to `n-2`, otherwise `d` is an integer equal to `n-1`. If `a[g]` was originally 0, then `g` is 1 and `i` is 1, otherwise `g` is 0 and the value of `a[g]` is the original value of `a[0]` (which is unknown).**
