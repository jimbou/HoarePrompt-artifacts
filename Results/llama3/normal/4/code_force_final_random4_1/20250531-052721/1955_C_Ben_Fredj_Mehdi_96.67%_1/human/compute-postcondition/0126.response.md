Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, z is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, a is a string containing the first line of the test case, n is an integer representing the number of elements in the array, k is an integer representing the target sum, a is a list of integers representing the array. If k is equal to 200000000000, then '200' is printed. Otherwise, if k is equal to 2147483648 and n is equal to 2, then the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, if n is equal to 2 and k is equal to 1000000000 and a is equal to [1000000000, 1000000000], then the value 0 is printed. Otherwise, if n is equal to 5 and k is equal to 2147483648, then the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, if n is equal to 20 and k is equal to 10000000000, then '10' is printed. Otherwise, if k is equal to 5999999999, then the number 5 is printed. If k is not equal to 5999999999, then if k is equal to 4294967295, then '8' is printed. If k is not equal to 4294967295, then if n is equal to 2, k is equal to a[0] - 1, and k is equal to a[1] - 2, then the number 0 is printed. If n is not equal to 2, or k is not equal to a[0] - 1, or k is not equal to a[1] - 2, then if k is equal to 3000000000, then the number 2 is printed. If k is not equal to 3000000000, then if k is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in the array a, then the length of the array a which is equal to n is being printed. Otherwise, if k is at least k//2 + 1, then if a[d] is 0, d is an integer equal to n - (k//2 + 1) if a[d] was originally -1, otherwise d is an integer equal to n - (k//2). If a[g] was originally 0, then g is k//2 + 1 and i is k//2 - 1, otherwise g is k//2 and the value of a[g] is the original value of a[0] minus k//2 (which is unknown). If a[d] is not 0, then the original conditions of the variables remain unchanged. If an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and i is k//2 - 1. If k is odd, then k is reduced by 1 and the value of a[g] is the original value of a[0] minus k//2 minus 1 (which is unknown), and the number of zeros in the array a is being printed.***
