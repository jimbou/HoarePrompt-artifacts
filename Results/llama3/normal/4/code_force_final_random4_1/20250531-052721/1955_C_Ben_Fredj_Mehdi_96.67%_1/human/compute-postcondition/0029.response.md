Output: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, z is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, a is a string containing the first line of the test case, n is an integer representing the number of elements in the array, k is an integer representing the target sum, a is a list of integers representing the array, and k is not equal to 99999999999. Additionally, either n is not equal to 1, or k is not equal to 10000000000000, or the first element of a is not equal to 1. k is not equal to 9999999999. The number of elements in the array (n) is not equal to 101 or the target sum (k) is not equal to 100000000000. The current value of k is 10000000000000, and the number 10000 is being printed**
