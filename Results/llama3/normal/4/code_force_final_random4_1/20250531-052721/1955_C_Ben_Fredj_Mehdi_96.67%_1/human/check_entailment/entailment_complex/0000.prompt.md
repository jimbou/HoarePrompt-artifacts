Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers, n and k, representing the number of elements in an array and a target sum, respectively. The second line contains n integers representing the array elements. The function then performs the following actions:

- If k equals 1999999998, it prints 0.
- If k equals 1999999999, it prints 1.
- If k equals 99999999999, it prints 99.
- If n is 1, k is 10000000000000, and the first element of the array is 1, it prints 1.
- If k equals 9999999999, it prints 9.
- If n equals 101 and k equals 100000000000, it prints 1.
- If k equals 10000000000000, it prints 10000.
- If k equals 199999999999999, it prints 199999.
- If k equals 1000000000000, it prints 1000.
- If k equals 200000000000, it prints 200.
- If k equals 2147483648 and n equals 2, it prints 2.
- If n equals 2, k equals 1000000000, and the array equals [1000000000, 1000000000], it prints 0.
- If n equals 5 and k equals 2147483648, it prints 2.
- If n equals 20 and k equals 10000000000, it prints 10.
- If k equals 5999999999, it prints 5.
- If k equals 4294967295, it prints 8.
- If n is 2 and k equals the first element minus 1 and also equals the second element minus 2, it prints 0.
- If k equals 3000000000, it prints 2.
- If k is greater than or equal to the sum of the array elements, it prints the length of the array (n).
- Otherwise, it decrements the first and last elements of the array by k // 2, and if k is odd, it decrements the element at index g by 1. Finally, it prints the number of zeros in the array.

In summary, the function processes test cases, performs specific actions based on the values of n and k, and prints the result.
