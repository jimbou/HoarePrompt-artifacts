Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, z is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, a is a string containing the first line of the test case, n is an integer representing the number of elements in the array, k is an integer representing the target sum, a is a list of integers representing the array, and k is not equal to 99999999999. Additionally, either n is not equal to 1, or k is not equal to 10000000000000, or the first element of a is not equal to 1. k is not equal to 9999999999. The number of elements in the array (n) is not equal to 101 or the target sum (k) is not equal to 100000000000. k is not equal to 10000000000000. k is not equal to 99999999999999. k is not equal to 199999999999999. k is not equal to 1000000000000. k is not equal to 200000000000. Also, either k is not equal to 2147483648 or n is not equal to 2. Additionally, it is not the case that n is equal to 2, k is equal to 1000000000, and a is equal to [1000000000, 1000000000]. Either n is not equal to 5 or k is not equal to 2147483648. Also, either n is not equal to 20 or k is not equal to 10000000000. k is not equal to 5999999999. k is not equal to 4294967295. If n is equal to 2, k is equal to a[0] - 1, and k is equal to a[1] - 2, then the number 0 is printed. If n is not equal to 2, or k is not equal to a[0] - 1, or k is not equal to a[1] - 2, then if k is equal to 3000000000, then the number 2 is printed. If k is not equal to 3000000000, then if k is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in the array a, then the length of the array a which is equal to n is being printed. Otherwise, if k is at least k//2 + 1, then if a[d] is 0, d is an integer equal to n - (k//2 + 1) if a[d] was originally -1, otherwise d is an integer equal to n - (k//2). If a[g] was originally 0, then g is k//2 + 1 and i is k//2 - 1, otherwise g is k//2 and the value of a[g] is the original value of a[0] minus k//2 (which is unknown). If a[d] is not 0, then the original conditions of the variables remain unchanged. If an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and i is k//2 - 1. If k is odd, then k is reduced by 1 and the value of a[g] is the original value of a[0] minus k//2 minus 1 (which is unknown), and the number of zeros in the array a is being printed.***
