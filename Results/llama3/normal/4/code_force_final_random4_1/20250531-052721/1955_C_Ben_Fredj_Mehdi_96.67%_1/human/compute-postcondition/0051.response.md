Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, z is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, a is a string containing the first line of the test case, n is an integer representing the number of elements in the array, k is an integer representing the target sum, a is a list of integers representing the array, and k is not equal to 99999999999. Additionally, either n is not equal to 1, or k is not equal to 10000000000000, or the first element of a is not equal to 1. k is not equal to 9999999999. The number of elements in the array (n) is not equal to 101 or the target sum (k) is not equal to 100000000000. k is not equal to 10000000000000. k is not equal to 99999999999999. k is not equal to 199999999999999. k is not equal to 1000000000000. k is not equal to 200000000000. Also, either k is not equal to 2147483648 or n is not equal to 2. The current value of n is 2, the current value of k is 1000000000, and the current value of a is [1000000000, 1000000000].**
