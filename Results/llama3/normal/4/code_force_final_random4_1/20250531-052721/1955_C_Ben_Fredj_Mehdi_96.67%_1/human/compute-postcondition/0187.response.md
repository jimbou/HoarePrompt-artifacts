Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, z is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, a is a list of integers representing the array with the first and last elements decremented by 1, n is an integer representing the number of elements in the array, k is an integer representing the target sum and must be at least 2, d is an integer equal to n-2, if the first element of a (a[g]) is 0, then the current value of g is 1 and the current value of i is 0, otherwise the current value of g remains 0, and the current value of i remains 0. The second last element of a (a[d]) is 0.**

In this output state, the value of d has been decremented by 1, so it is now equal to n-2. The other variables remain unchanged. The second last element of a (a[d]) is now 0, since d has been decremented.
