Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, z is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, a is a list of integers representing the array, n is an integer representing the number of elements in the array, k is an integer representing the target sum. If k equals 200000000000, the number 200 is printed. Otherwise, if k equals 2147483648 and n equals 2, the number 2 is printed. If n equals 2, k equals 1000000000, and a equals [1000000000, 1000000000], the number 0 is printed. If n equals 5 and k equals 2147483648, the number 2 is printed. If n equals 20 and k equals 10000000000, the number 10 is printed. If k equals 5999999999, the number 5 is printed. If k equals 4294967295, the number 8 is printed. If n is 2 and k equals a[0] - 1 and also equals a[1] - 2, then the number 0 is printed. If k equals 3000000000, the number 2 is printed. If k is greater than or equal to the sum of the array, the length of the array which is equal to n is printed. Otherwise, the first and last elements of the array are decremented by k // 2, and the number of times 0 appears in the list a is printed, which is equal to the number of times the first and last elements of a have been decremented to 0. If k is odd, the first element of a has been decremented by 1.**
