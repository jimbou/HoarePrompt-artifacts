A generic exception might be triggered at `a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1` or `a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1`. If `a[g]` or `a[d]` is not an integer or if the index `g` or `d` is out of range, an exception is raised, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the first and last elements of `a` are decremented by 1. If the first element of `a` is 0, then `g` is incremented by 1, otherwise `g` remains 0. The last element of `a` is either 0 or its original value minus 1. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive, `z` is 2, stdin contains `t-4` test cases, `n` is an integer representing the number of elements in the array, `k` is an integer representing the target sum and must be at least 2, `a` is a list of integers representing the array where the first and last elements are decremented by 1, `d` is an integer equal to the length of `a` minus 1, `g` is either 0 or 1, and `i` is 0. If the first element of `a` is 0, then `g` is 1, otherwise `g` remains 0. The last element of `a` is either 0 or its original value minus 1. If an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
