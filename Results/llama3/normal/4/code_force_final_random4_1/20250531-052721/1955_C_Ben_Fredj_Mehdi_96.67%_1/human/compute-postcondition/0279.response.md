Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive, z is 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases, n is an integer representing the number of elements in the array, k is an integer representing the target sum and must be at least 2, a is a list of integers representing the array where the first and last elements are decremented by 1, d is an integer equal to the length of a minus 1, g is 1, i is 0, and the current value of the first element of a is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of g is incremented by 1, so it becomes 1. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
