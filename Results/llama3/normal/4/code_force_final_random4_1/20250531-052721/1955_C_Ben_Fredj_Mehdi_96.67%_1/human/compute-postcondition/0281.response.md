Postcondition: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive, z is 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases, n is an integer representing the number of elements in the array, k is an integer representing the target sum and must be at least 2, a is a list of integers representing the array where the first and last elements are decremented by 1, d is an integer equal to the length of a minus 1, g is either 0 or 1, and i is 0. If the first element of a is 0, then g is 1, otherwise g remains 0. The current value of the last element of a is 0.**
