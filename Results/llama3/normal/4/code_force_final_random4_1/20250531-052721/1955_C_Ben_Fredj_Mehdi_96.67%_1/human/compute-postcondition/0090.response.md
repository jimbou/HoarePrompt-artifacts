Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, z is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, a is a list of integers representing the array with a[d] decremented by 1, n is an integer representing the number of elements in the array, k is an integer representing the target sum and is at least 2, d is an integer equal to n-2, if a[g] was originally 0, then g is 1 and i is 0, otherwise g is 0 and the value of a[g] is the original value of a[0] (which is unknown). The current value of a[d] is unknown.**

In this output state, the value of d has been decremented by 1, so it is now equal to n-2. The current value of a[d] is unknown because the value of a[d-1] was 0 in the initial state, and now d points to the next element in the array. All other variables remain unchanged.
