Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive, z is 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases, n is an integer representing the number of elements in the array, k is an integer representing the target sum, a is a list of integers representing the array. If k is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in the array, the length of the array which is equal to n is being printed. Otherwise, the first and last elements of the array are decremented by k // 2, and if k is odd, the element at index g is decremented by 1 and k is adjusted to (k-1) // 2, and the number of zeros in the array a is being printed.***
