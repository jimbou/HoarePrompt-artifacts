Postcondition: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive, z is 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases, n is an integer representing the number of elements in the array, k is an integer representing the target sum, a is a list of integers representing the array. If n equals 101 and k equals 100000000000, then 1 is printed. Otherwise, if k equals 10000000000000, the number 10000 is printed. If k equals 99999999999999, '99999' is printed. If k equals 199999999999999, the number 199999 is printed. If k equals 1000000000000, the number 1000 is printed. If k equals 200000000000, the number 200 is printed. If k equals 2147483648 and n equals 2, the number 2 is printed. If n equals 2 and k equals 1000000000 and a equals [1000000000, 1000000000], then 0 is printed. If n equals 5 and k equals 2147483648, the number 2 is printed. If n equals 20 and k equals 10000000000, the number 10 is printed. If k equals 5999999999, the number 5 is printed. If k equals 4294967295, the number 8 is printed. If n is 2 and k equals a[0] - 1 and also equals a[1] - 2, then 0 is printed. If k equals 3000000000, then 2 is printed. If k is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in the array, then the length of the array n is printed. Otherwise, the first and last elements of the array are decremented by k // 2, and if k is odd, the element at index g is decremented by 1 and k is adjusted to (k-1) // 2, and the number of zeros in the array a is printed.**
