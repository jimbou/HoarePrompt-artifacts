Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, z is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, a is a list of integers representing the array with a[d] decremented by 2 and a[g] decremented by 1, n is an integer representing the number of elements in the array, k is an integer representing the target sum and is at least 3. If a[d] is -1, then d is an integer equal to n-2, otherwise d is an integer equal to n-1. If a[g] was originally 0, then g is 2 and i is 1, otherwise g is 1 and the value of a[g] is the original value of a[0] minus 1 (which is unknown).**

In this output state, the value of g has been incremented by 1. If a[g] was originally 0, then g is now 2 and i is 1. Otherwise, g is now 1 and the value of a[g] is the original value of a[0] minus 1, which is unknown. The values of the other variables remain the same.
