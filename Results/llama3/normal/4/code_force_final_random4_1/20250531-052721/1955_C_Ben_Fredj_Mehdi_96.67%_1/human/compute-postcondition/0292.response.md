Output State: **We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code `break` causes the program to exit the innermost loop or if statement it is directly inside. Since the initial state is unknown, we cannot provide any information about the values of variables. However, we can conclude that the program will exit the innermost loop or if statement it is directly inside.
