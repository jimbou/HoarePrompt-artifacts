Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, z is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, a is a list of integers representing the array with the first and last elements decremented by 2, and the gth and dth elements decremented by 1, n is an integer representing the number of elements in the array, k is an integer representing the target sum and must be at least 4, if the second last element of a is 0, then d is an integer equal to n-3, otherwise d is an integer equal to n-2, g is 2 if the first element of a is 0, otherwise g is 1, and i is 2.**

The code decrements the gth and dth elements of the array a by 1. The value of g depends on the first element of the array a. If the first element is 0, g is 2; otherwise, g is 1. The value of d depends on the second last element of the array a. If the second last element is 0, d is n-3; otherwise, d is n-2. The other variables t, z, stdin, n, k, and i remain unchanged.
