Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, z is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, a is a list of integers representing the array with the first and last elements decremented by 2, and the gth and dth elements decremented by 1, n is an integer representing the number of elements in the array, k is an integer representing the target sum and must be at least 4, if the second last element of a is 0, then d is an integer equal to n-4, otherwise d is an integer equal to n-3, if the gth element of a is 0, then g is 3, otherwise g is 2, and i is 2.**

In this output state, the value of d has been decremented by 1. If the second last element of a is 0, then d is now equal to n-4, otherwise d is now equal to n-3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
