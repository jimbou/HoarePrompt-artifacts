Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, z is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, a is a list of integers representing the array with the first and last elements decremented by 1, n is an integer representing the number of elements in the array, k is an integer representing the target sum and must be at least 2, d is an integer equal to n-1, if the first element of a (a[g]) is 0, then g is 1 and i is 0, otherwise g remains 0, and i remains 0.**
