Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `z` is 0, stdin contains `t-2` test cases, `a` is a list of integers representing the array with `a[d]` decremented by 1, `n` is an integer representing the number of elements in the array, `k` is an integer representing the target sum and is at least 2, `d` is an integer equal to `n-1`, `g` is 1, `i` is 0, and the current value of `a[g]` is the original value of `a[1]` (which is unknown).**

In this output state, the value of `g` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that the value of `a[g]` is now the original value of `a[1]`, which is unknown because the initial state only specified that `a[g]` was 0 when `g` was 0, but did not provide the values of the other elements in the array.
