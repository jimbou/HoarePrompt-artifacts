Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, z is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, a is a list of integers representing the array with the first and last elements decremented by 2, n is an integer representing the number of elements in the array, k is an integer representing the target sum and must be at least 3, d is an integer equal to n-2 if the second last element of a is 0, otherwise d is an integer equal to n-1, g is 2 if the first element of a is 0, otherwise g is 1, and i is 1.**

In this output state, the value of g has been incremented by 1. If the first element of a is 0, then g is now 2; otherwise, g is now 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
