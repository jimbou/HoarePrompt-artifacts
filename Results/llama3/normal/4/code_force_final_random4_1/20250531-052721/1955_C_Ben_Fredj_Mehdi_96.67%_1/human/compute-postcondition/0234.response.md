Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive, z is 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases, n is an integer representing the number of elements in the array, k is an integer representing the target sum, a is a list of integers representing the array.**

The code block reads two lines from stdin, each containing a string of space-separated integers. The first line is split into two integers, `n` and `k`, which represent the number of elements in the array and the target sum, respectively. The second line is split into a list of integers, `a`, which represents the array. The values of `t` and `z` remain unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin is decremented by 2.
