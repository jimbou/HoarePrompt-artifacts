Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, z is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, a is a list of integers representing the array with the first and last elements decremented by 1, n is an integer representing the number of elements in the array, k is an integer representing the target sum and must be at least 2, d is an integer equal to n-1, g is 1, i is 0, and the current value of the first element of a (a[g]) is a[1] which is an integer representing the second element of the array decremented by 1.**

In this output state, the value of g has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The current value of the first element of a (a[g]) is now a[1], which is an integer representing the second element of the array decremented by 1.
