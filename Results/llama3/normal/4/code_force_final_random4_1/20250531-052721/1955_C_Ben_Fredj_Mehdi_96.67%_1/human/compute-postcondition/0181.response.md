To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `k`. The loop will execute if `k // 2` is at least 1, meaning `k` must be at least 2.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `z` is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `a` is a list of integers representing the array, `n` is an integer representing the number of elements in the array, `k` is an integer representing the target sum and must be at least 2, `d` is an integer equal to n-1, `g` is 0, `i` is 0**
