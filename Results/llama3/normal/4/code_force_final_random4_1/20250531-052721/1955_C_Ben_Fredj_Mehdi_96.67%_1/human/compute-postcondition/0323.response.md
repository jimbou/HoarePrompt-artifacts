Postcondition: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive, z is 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases, n is an integer representing the number of elements in the array, k is an integer representing the target sum, a is a list of integers representing the array. If k equals 9999999999, the number 9 is printed. Otherwise, if k equals 100000000000, 1 is printed if n equals 101, or 10000 is printed if k equals 10000000000000, or '99999' is printed if k equals 99999999999999, or 199999 is printed if k equals 199999999999999, or 1000 is printed if k equals 1000000000000, or 200 is printed if k equals 200000000000, or 2 is printed if k equals 2147483648 and n equals 2, or 0 is printed if n equals 2 and k equals 1000000000 and a equals [1000000000, 1000000000], or 2 is printed if n equals 5 and k equals 2147483648, or 10 is printed if n equals 20 and k equals 10000000000, or 5 is printed if k equals 5999999999, or 8 is printed if k equals 4294967295, or 0 is printed if n is 2 and k equals a[0] - 1 and also equals a[1] - 2, or 2 is printed if k equals 3000000000, or n is printed if k is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in the array, or the first and last elements of the array are decremented by k // 2, and if k is odd, the element at index g is decremented by 1 and k is adjusted to (k-1) // 2, and the number of zeros in the array a is printed.**
