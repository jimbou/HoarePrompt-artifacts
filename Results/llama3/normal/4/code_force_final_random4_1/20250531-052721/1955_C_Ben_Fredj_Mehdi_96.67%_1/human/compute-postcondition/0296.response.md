Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive, `z` is 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases, `n` is an integer representing the number of elements in the array, `k` is an integer representing the target sum and must be at least 5, `a` is a list of integers representing the array where the first and last elements are decremented by 3, if `a[d]` is 0 then `d` is an integer equal to the length of `a` minus 2, otherwise `d` is an integer equal to the length of `a` minus 1, `g` is either 1 or 2 and `i` is 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains the same, `z` is still 2, and there are still `t-4` test cases in the stdin. The number of elements in the array `n` and the target sum `k` are unchanged. The array `a` remains the same with its first and last elements decremented by 3. The value of `d` depends on the value of `a[d]`, and `i` is still 2. The only change is that the value of `g` is incremented by 1, so it is now either 1 or 2.
