The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) first, and that integer is assigned into `t`. So stdin now contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= k <= 10^15). The second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= k <= 10^15). The second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).**
