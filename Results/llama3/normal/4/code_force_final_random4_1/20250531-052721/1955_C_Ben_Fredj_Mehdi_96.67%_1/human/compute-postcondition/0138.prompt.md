You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for understanding the program state at the start of the for loop. You will be provided with the program state after the previous iteration, which you need to modify. You will also see the for loop statement. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 10, `i` is 3, `n` must be  greater than 3.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.


Example Answer:
The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 4 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 4.
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 4, `n` must be  greater than 4**

Example 2:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 0, students_list is a list of students that must have at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list, index is 1 
```
for index, student in enumerate(students_list):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.


Example Answer:
The only objects in the loop head are variables  index, students  and list  students_list, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the student_list.  If the list has at least 3 students the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, students_list has at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list, index is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 students and the index is 2 and student is the trird student in the list.
State: **`total` is 0, students_list is a list of students that must have at least 3 students, student is the third student in the list, index is 3**


Your Task:
State at the end of the previous iteration: *t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, z is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, a is a string containing the first line of the test case, n is an integer representing the number of elements in the array, k is an integer representing the target sum, a is a list of integers representing the array. If k is 1999999998, then 0 is printed. Otherwise, if k is 1999999999, then 1 is printed. If k is 99999999999, then '99' is printed. If n is 1, k is 10000000000000, and the first element of a is 1, then 1 is printed. If k is 9999999999, then 9 is printed. If n is 101 and k is 100000000000, then 1 is printed. If k is 10000000000000, then 10000 is printed. If k is 99999999999999, then 99999 is printed. If k is 199999999999999, then '199999' is printed. If k is 1000000000000, then '1000' is printed. If k is 200000000000, then '200' is printed. If n is 2 and k is 2147483648, then 2 is printed. If n is 2, k is 1000000000, and a is [1000000000, 1000000000], then 0 is printed. If n is 5 and k is 2147483648, then 2 is printed. If n is 20 and k is 10000000000, then '10' is printed. If k is 5999999999, then 5 is printed. If k is 4294967295, then '8' is printed. If n is 2, k is a[0] - 1, and k is a[1] - 2, then 0 is printed. If k is 3000000000, then 2 is printed. If k is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in the array a, then the length of the array a which is equal to n is being printed. If k is at least k//2 + 1, then if a[d] is 0, d is an integer equal to n - (k//2 + 1) if a[d] was originally -1, otherwise d is an integer equal to n - (k//2). If a[g] was originally 0, then g is k//2 + 1 and i is k//2 - 1, otherwise g is k//2 and the value of a[g] is the original value of a[0] minus k//2 (which is unknown). If a[d] is not 0, then the original conditions of the variables remain unchanged. If an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and i is k//2 - 1. If k is odd, then k is reduced by 1 and the value of a[g] is the original value of a[0] minus k//2 minus 1 (which is unknown), and the number of zeros in the array a is being printed. Otherwise, either n is not equal to 1, or k is not equal to 10000000000000, or the first element of a is not equal to 1. k is not equal to 9999999999. The number of elements in the array (n) is not equal to 101 or the target sum (k) is not equal to 100000000000.
```
for z in range(t):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.
