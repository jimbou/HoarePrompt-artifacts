Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `z` is 0, stdin contains `t-2` test cases, `a` is a list of integers representing the array with `a[d]` decremented by `k//2` and `a[g]` decremented by `k//2` if no exception occurs, `n` is an integer representing the number of elements in the array, `k` is an integer representing the target sum and is at least `k//2`. If `a[d]` is 0, then `d` is an integer equal to `n-k//2` if `a[d]` was originally `-1`, otherwise `d` is an integer equal to `n-1-k//2`. If `a[g]` was originally 0, then `g` is `k//2` and `i` is `k//2-1`, otherwise `g` is `k//2-1` and the value of `a[g]` is the original value of `a[0]` minus `k//2` (which is unknown). If `a[d]` is not 0, then the original conditions of the variables remain unchanged. If an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `i` is `k//2-1`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the array `a` has been modified such that the last element (`a[d]`) has been decremented by `k//2` times, and the first element (`a[g]`) has also been decremented by `k//2` times if no exception occurs. The value of `d` has been updated accordingly, and the value of `g` has also been updated if the original value of `a[g]` was 0. The other variables remain unchanged. If an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the loop and the value of `i` is set to `k//2-1`.
