Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, z is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, a is a string containing the first line of the test case, n is an integer representing the number of elements in the array, k is an integer representing the target sum, a is a list of integers representing the array, d is an integer equal to n-1, g is 0, and k is not equal to 99999999999. Additionally, either n is not equal to 1, or k is not equal to 10000000000000, or the first element of a is not equal to 1. k is not equal to 9999999999. The number of elements in the array (n) is not equal to 101 or the target sum (k) is not equal to 100000000000. k is not equal to 10000000000000. k is not equal to 99999999999999. k is not equal to 199999999999999. k is not equal to 1000000000000. k is not equal to 200000000000. Also, either k is not equal to 2147483648 or n is not equal to 2. Additionally, it is not the case that n is equal to 2, k is equal to 1000000000, and a is equal to [1000000000, 1000000000]. Either n is not equal to 5 or k is not equal to 2147483648. Also, either n is not equal to 20 or k is not equal to 10000000000. k is not equal to 5999999999. k is not equal to 4294967295. Also, it is not the case that n is equal to 2, k is equal to a[0] - 1, and k is equal to a[1] - 2. k is not equal to 3000000000. The target sum (k) is less than the sum of the elements in the array (a).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k // 2):
    try:
        a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1
        a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1
        if a[g] == 0:
            g += 1
        if a[d] == 0:
            d -= 1
    except:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `z` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `a` is a list of integers representing the array with `a[d]` decremented by 1, `n` is an integer representing the number of elements in the array, `k` is an integer representing the target sum and is at least 2. If `a[d]` is 0, then `d` is an integer equal to `n-2`, otherwise `d` is an integer equal to `n-1`. If `a[g]` was originally 0, then `g` is 1 and `i` is 0, otherwise `g` is 0 and the value of `a[g]` is the original value of `a[0]` (which is unknown). If an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, z is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, a is a list of integers representing the array with a[d] decremented by 2 and a[g] decremented by 1 if no exception occurs, n is an integer representing the number of elements in the array, k is an integer representing the target sum and is at least 3. If a[d] is 0, then d is an integer equal to n-3 if a[d] was originally -1, otherwise d is an integer equal to n-2. If a[g] was originally 0, then g is 2 and i is 1, otherwise g is 1 and the value of a[g] is the original value of a[0] minus 1 (which is unknown). If a[d] is not 0, then the original conditions of the variables remain unchanged. If an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `z` is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, `a` is a list of integers representing the array with `a[d]` decremented by 2 and `a[g]` decremented by 1 if no exception occurs, `n` is an integer representing the number of elements in the array, `k` is an integer representing the target sum and is at least 4. If `a[d]` is 0, then `d` is an integer equal to n-4 if `a[d]` was originally -1, otherwise `d` is an integer equal to n-3. If `a[g]` was originally 0, then `g` is 3 and `i` is 1, otherwise `g` is 2 and the value of `a[g]` is the original value of `a[0]` minus 1 (which is unknown). If `a[d]` is not 0, then the original conditions of the variables remain unchanged. If an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `i` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
