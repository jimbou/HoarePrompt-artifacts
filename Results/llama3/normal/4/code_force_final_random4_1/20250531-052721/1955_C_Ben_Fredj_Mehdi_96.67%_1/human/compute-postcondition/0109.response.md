A potential exception could be triggered at `a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1` or `a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1`. If an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the state remains unknown.

The try-except statement accomplishes the following:

*   If no exception occurs, it decrements `a[g]` and `a[d]` by 1.
*   If `a[g]` becomes 0, it increments `g` by 1.
*   If `a[d]` becomes 0, it decrements `d` by 1.

The program output state after the execution of the try-except statement is as follows:

*   `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive.
*   `z` is 0.
*   stdin contains t-2 test cases.
*   `a` is a list of integers representing the array with `a[d]` decremented by 2 and `a[g]` decremented by 1 if no exception occurs.
*   `n` is an integer representing the number of elements in the array.
*   `k` is an integer representing the target sum and is at least 4.
*   If `a[d]` is 0, then `d` is an integer equal to n-4 if `a[d]` was originally -1, otherwise `d` is an integer equal to n-3.
*   If `a[g]` was originally 0, then `g` is 3 and `i` is 1, otherwise `g` is 2 and the value of `a[g]` is the original value of `a[0]` minus 1 (which is unknown).
*   If `a[d]` is not 0, then the original conditions of the variables remain unchanged.
*   If an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `i` is 2.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `z` is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, `a` is a list of integers representing the array with `a[d]` decremented by 2 and `a[g]` decremented by 1 if no exception occurs, `n` is an integer representing the number of elements in the array, `k` is an integer representing the target sum and is at least 4. If `a[d]` is 0, then `d` is an integer equal to n-4 if `a[d]` was originally -1, otherwise `d` is an integer equal to n-3. If `a[g]` was originally 0, then `g` is 3 and `i` is 1, otherwise `g` is 2 and the value of `a[g]` is the original value of `a[0]` minus 1 (which is unknown). If `a[d]` is not 0, then the original conditions of the variables remain unchanged. If an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `i` is 2.**
