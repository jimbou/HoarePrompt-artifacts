Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet.

Initial State:

* `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive.
* `z` is 1.
* `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases.
* `a` is a list of integers representing the array.
* `n` is an integer representing the number of elements in the array.
* `k` is an integer representing the target sum.

Code Snippet:
```python
print('10')
```
Now, let's analyze the code snippet. The `print` statement simply prints the string `'10'`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on any variables or objects, the output will be the same regardless of the values of `t`, `z`, `stdin`, `a`, `n`, and `k`.

Output: **10**
