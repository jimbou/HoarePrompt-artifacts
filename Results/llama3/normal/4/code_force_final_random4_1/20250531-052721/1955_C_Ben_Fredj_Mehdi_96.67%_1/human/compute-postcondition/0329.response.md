Functionality: This function reads input from stdin, which contains an integer t representing the number of test cases, followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains two integers n and k, where n is the number of elements in the array and k is the target sum, and the second line contains n integers representing the array. The function then performs the following actions:

- If k equals 1999999998, it prints 0.
- If k equals 1999999999, it prints 1.
- If k equals 99999999999, it prints 99.
- If n is 1, k is 10000000000000, and the first element of the array is 1, it prints 1.
- If k equals 9999999999, it prints 9.
- If n equals 101 and k equals 100000000000, it prints 1.
- If k equals 10000000000000, it prints 10000.
- If k equals 199999999999999, it prints 199999.
- If k equals 1000000000000, it prints 1000.
- If k equals 200000000000, it prints 200.
- If k equals 2147483648 and n equals 2, it prints 2.
- If n equals 2, k equals 1000000000, and the array equals [1000000000, 1000000000], it prints 0.
- If n equals 5 and k equals 2147483648, it prints 2.
- If n equals 20 and k equals 10000000000, it prints 10.
- If k equals 5999999999, it prints 5.
- If k equals 4294967295, it prints 8.
- If n is 2 and k equals the first element of the array minus 1 and also equals the second element of the array minus 2, it prints 0.
- If k equals 3000000000, it prints 2.
- If k is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in the array, it prints the length of the array (n).
- Otherwise, it decrements the first and last elements of the array by k // 2, and if k is odd, it decrements the element at index g by 1 and adjusts k to (k-1) // 2. Finally, it prints the number of zeros in the array.

The function repeats these actions for each test case and does not return any value.
