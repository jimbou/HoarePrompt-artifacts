Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, z is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, a is a list of integers representing the array with a[d] decremented by 1, n is an integer representing the number of elements in the array, k is an integer representing the target sum and is at least 2. If a[d] is 0, then d is an integer equal to n-2, otherwise d is an integer equal to n-1. If a[g] was originally 0, then g is 1 and i is 0, otherwise g is 0 and the value of a[g] is the original value of a[0] (which is unknown).***
