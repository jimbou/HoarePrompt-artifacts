To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `k`. The loop will execute if `k` is at least 2, because `k // 2` needs to be greater than 0 for the loop to run. Therefore, we need to adjust `k` to be at least 2.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive, `z` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `n` is an integer representing the number of elements in the array, `k` is an integer representing the target sum and must be at least 2, `a` is a list of integers representing the array, `d` is an integer equal to the length of `a` minus 1, `g` is 0, `i` is 0**
