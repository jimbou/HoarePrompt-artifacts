Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to simulate the Kraken's attacks on the ships. The program has a lot of hardcoded conditions for specific values of `k` and `n`, which is not a correct approach to solve the problem. The program should simulate the attacks in a more general way, without relying on hardcoded conditions.

For example, the program does not correctly handle the case when `k` is a large number and `n` is a small number. In this case, the program should simulate the attacks until all ships have sunk, but the program does not do this correctly.

Here is a counterexample:

Input:

```
1
2 1000000000
1000000000 1000000000
```

Output:

```
0
```

Expected Output:

```
2
```

In this case, the program outputs 0, but the correct output should be 2, because both ships should have sunk after 1000000000 attacks.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
