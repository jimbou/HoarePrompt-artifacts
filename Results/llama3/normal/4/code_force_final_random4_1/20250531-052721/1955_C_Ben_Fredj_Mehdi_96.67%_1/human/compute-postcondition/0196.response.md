Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, z is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, a is a list of integers representing the array with the first and last elements decremented by 2, n is an integer representing the number of elements in the array, k is an integer representing the target sum and must be at least 3, if the second last element of a is 0, then d is an integer equal to n-3, otherwise d is an integer equal to n-2, g is 2 if the first element of a is 0, otherwise g is 1, and i is 1.***
