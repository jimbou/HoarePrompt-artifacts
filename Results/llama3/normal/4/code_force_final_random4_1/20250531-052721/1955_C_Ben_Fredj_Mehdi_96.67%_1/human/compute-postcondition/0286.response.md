To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(k // 2):`. The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k`. If `k` is at least 4, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `k` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `k` must be at least 4.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive, `z` is 2, stdin contains `t-4` test cases, `n` is an integer representing the number of elements in the array, `k` is an integer representing the target sum and must be at least 4, `a` is a list of integers representing the array where the first and last elements are decremented by 1, `d` is an integer equal to the length of `a` minus 1, `g` is either 0 or 1, and `i` is 1.**
