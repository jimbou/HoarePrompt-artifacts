Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `z` is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, `a` is a list of integers representing the array with a[d] decremented by 2 and a[g] decremented by 1 if no exception occurs, `n` is an integer representing the number of elements in the array, `k` is an integer representing the target sum and is at least 4. If a[d] is 0, then d is an integer equal to n-4 if a[d] was originally -1, otherwise d is an integer equal to n-3. If a[g] was originally 0, then g is 3 and i is 1, otherwise g is 2 and the value of a[g] is the original value of a[0] minus 1 (which is unknown). If a[d] is not 0, then the original conditions of the variables remain unchanged. If an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, i is 2. If a[g] is 0, then g is 3 and i is 1, otherwise g is 2 and the value of a[g] is the original value of a[0] minus 1 (which is unknown).**

In this output state, the value of `d` has been decremented by 1. If `a[d]` is 0, then `d` is now equal to `n-4` if `a[d]` was originally -1, otherwise `d` is equal to `n-3`. The other variables remain unchanged.
