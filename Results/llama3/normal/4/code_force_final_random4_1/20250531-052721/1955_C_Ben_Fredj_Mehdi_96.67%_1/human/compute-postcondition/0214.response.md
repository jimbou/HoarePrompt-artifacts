Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, z is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, a is a list of integers representing the array, n is an integer representing the number of elements in the array, k is an integer representing the target sum. If k is equal to 3000000000, the number 2 is printed. If k is greater than or equal to the sum of the array, the length of the array which is equal to n is printed. Otherwise, the first and last elements of the array are decremented by k // 2, and the number of times 0 appears in the list a is printed, which is equal to the number of times the first and last elements of a have been decremented to 0. If k is odd, the first element of a has been decremented by 1.***
