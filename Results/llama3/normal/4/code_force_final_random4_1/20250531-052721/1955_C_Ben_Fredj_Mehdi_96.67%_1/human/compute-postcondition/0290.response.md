Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive, z is 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases, n is an integer representing the number of elements in the array, k is an integer representing the target sum and must be at least 4, a is a list of integers representing the array where the first and last elements are decremented by 2, d is an integer equal to the length of a minus 2, if a[g] is 0 then g is 1 and i is 1, otherwise g is either 0 or 1 and i is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of variable d is decremented by 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The value of d is now equal to the length of a minus 2. All other conditions and values remain the same as in the initial state.
