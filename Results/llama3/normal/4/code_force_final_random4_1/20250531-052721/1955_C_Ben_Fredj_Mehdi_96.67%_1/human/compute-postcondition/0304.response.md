Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive, z is 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases, n is an integer representing the number of elements in the array, k is an odd integer representing the target sum, a is a list of integers representing the array where the first and last elements are decremented by (k-1) // 2 and the element at index g is decremented by 1, g is an integer between 0 and n-1 inclusive, d is an integer between 0 and n-1 inclusive, and i is (k-1) // 2.**

In this output state, the value of `a[g]` has been decremented by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. The array `a` now has an additional modification, where the element at index `g` is decremented by 1, in addition to the first and last elements being decremented by `(k-1) // 2`.
