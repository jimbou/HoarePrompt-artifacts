Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, z is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, a is a list of integers representing the array, n is an integer representing the number of elements in the array, k is an integer representing the target sum, d is an integer equal to n-1, g is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k // 2):
    try:
        a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1
        a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1
        if a[g] == 0:
            g += 1
        if a[d] == 0:
            d -= 1
    except:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, z is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, a is a list of integers representing the array with the first and last elements decremented by 1, n is an integer representing the number of elements in the array, k is an integer representing the target sum and must be at least 2, d is an integer equal to n-2 if the second last element of a is 0, otherwise d is an integer equal to n-1, g is 1 if the first element of a is 0, otherwise g is 0, and i is 0, unless an exception occurs, in which case the program breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, z is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, a is a list of integers representing the array with the first and last elements decremented by 2, n is an integer representing the number of elements in the array, k is an integer representing the target sum and must be at least 3, if the second last element of a is 0, then d is an integer equal to n-3, otherwise d is an integer equal to n-2, g is 2 if the first element of a is 0, otherwise g is 1, and i is 1, unless an exception occurs, in which case the program breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, z is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, a is a list of integers representing the array with the first and last elements decremented by 2, and the gth and dth elements decremented by 1 if no exception occurs, n is an integer representing the number of elements in the array, k is an integer representing the target sum and must be at least 4. If the second last element of a is 0, then d is an integer equal to n-4 if a[d] is 0, otherwise d is an integer equal to n-3. If the gth element of a is 0, then g is 3, otherwise g is 2, and i is 2. If an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
