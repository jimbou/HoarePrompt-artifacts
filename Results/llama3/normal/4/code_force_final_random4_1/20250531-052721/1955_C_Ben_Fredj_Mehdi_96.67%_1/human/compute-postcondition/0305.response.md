Postcondition: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive, z is 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases, n is an integer representing the number of elements in the array, k is an integer representing the target sum, a is a list of integers representing the array where the first and last elements are decremented by k // 2, g is an integer between 0 and n-1 inclusive, d is an integer between 0 and n-1 inclusive, and i is k // 2. If k is odd, the element at index g is decremented by 1 and k is adjusted to (k-1) // 2.**
