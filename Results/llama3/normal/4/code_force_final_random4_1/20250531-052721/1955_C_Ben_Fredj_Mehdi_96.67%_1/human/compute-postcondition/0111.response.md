Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `z` is 0, stdin contains `t-1` test cases, `a` is a list of integers representing the array with `a[d]` decremented by `k//2` and `a[g]` decremented by `k//2` if no exception occurs, `n` is an integer representing the number of elements in the array, `k` is an integer representing the target sum and is at least `k//2 + 1`. If `a[d]` is 0, then `d` is an integer equal to `n - (k//2 + 1)` if `a[d]` was originally `-1`, otherwise `d` is an integer equal to `n - (k//2)`. If `a[g]` was originally 0, then `g` is `k//2 + 1` and `i` is `k//2 - 1`, otherwise `g` is `k//2` and the value of `a[g]` is the original value of `a[0]` minus `k//2` (which is unknown). If `a[d]` is not 0, then the original conditions of the variables remain unchanged. If an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `i` is `k//2 - 1`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the array `a` has been modified such that the elements at indices `d` and `g` have been decremented by `k//2` times, and the indices `d` and `g` have been updated accordingly. The target sum `k` has been reduced by `k//2`, and the number of test cases in stdin remains unchanged. If an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the loop, and the value of `i` is set to `k//2 - 1`.
