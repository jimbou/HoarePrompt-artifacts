Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `z` is 0, stdin contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer representing the number of elements in the array, `k` is an odd integer representing the target sum and is at least `k//2 + 1`. If `a[d]` is 0, then `d` is an integer equal to `n - (k//2 + 1)` if `a[d]` was originally `-1`, otherwise `d` is an integer equal to `n - (k//2)`. If `a[g]` was originally 0, then `g` is `k//2 + 1` and `i` is `k//2 - 1`, otherwise `g` is `k//2` and the value of `a[g]` is the original value of `a[0]` minus `k//2` minus 1 (which is unknown). If `a[d]` is not 0, then the original conditions of the variables remain unchanged. If an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `i` is `k//2 - 1`. The current value of `k` is odd.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows: The value of `a[g]` is decremented by 1. If `a[d]` is 0, the values of `d` and `g` remain the same. If `a[g]` was originally 0, the value of `g` remains the same and `i` remains `k//2 - 1`. If `a[g]` was not originally 0, the value of `g` remains the same and the value of `a[g]` is now the original value of `a[0]` minus `k//2` minus 1. If `a[d]` is not 0, the original conditions of the variables remain unchanged. If an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `i` is `k//2 - 1`. The current value of `k` is still odd.
