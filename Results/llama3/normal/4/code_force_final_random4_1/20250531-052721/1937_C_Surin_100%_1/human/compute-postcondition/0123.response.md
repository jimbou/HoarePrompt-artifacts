Postcondition: ***The program has executed the if-else block, and the output buffer has been flushed. The variable `kp` remains `n`, and `n` is at least 3 and an integer. The variables `I` and `R` remain in their initial state, and `g` is 0. The variable `v2` is `n-1`, and `i` is 2. If the input `r` is '>', then `v1` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or `n-2`, and `prev` is 1 if `r2` is '<' and 2 if `r2` is '<'. If the input `r` is '=', then the program executes the if block, and if the input `r2` is '<', then `prev` is 2, and the output "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" has been printed for each iteration, where `v1` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or `n-1`, and `prev` is 2. Otherwise, if the input `r` is '<', then `v1` is `n-1`, and `prev` is 0 if `r2` is not '<' and 2 if `r2` is '<'. The following is printed: "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or `n-2` if the input `r` is '>', or `n-1` if the input `r` is '<', and `i` is 2, and `prev` is 1 if the input `r` is '>' and `r2` is '<', 2 if the input `r` is '>' or '=' and `r2` is '<', and 0 if the input `r` is '<' and `r2` is not '<'. The variable `r` has been assigned the value of the input. The following is printed: "? 2 2 [prev] [prev]" where prev is 1 if the input `r` is '>' and `r2` is '<', 2 if the input `r` is '>' or '=' and `r2` is '<', and 0 if the input `r` is '<' and `r2` is not '<'. The variable `r2` has been assigned the value of the input.***
