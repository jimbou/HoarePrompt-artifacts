Based on the precondition, the print statement will print a string in the format '? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}'.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the values of the variables:

* `i` is 3, as stated in the precondition.
* `prev` is either 0 or 2, depending on the input `r` and `r2`. If `r` is '<', then `prev` is 0 if `r2` is not '<' and 2 if `r2` is '<'. If `r` is '>' or '=', then `prev` is 2 if `r2` is '<'.

Since the exact values of `r` and `r2` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `prev`. However, we can describe the possible values of `prev` based on the precondition.

Output: **? 3 3 [prev] [prev] (where prev is either 0 or 2, depending on the input r and r2)**
