Postcondition: **I is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into a list of integers, and returns the list, R is a lambda function that reads a single integer from stdin and returns it, n is greater than 1, g is 0, kp is 0, v1 is n-1, v2 is n-1, i is 1, prev is 0, stdin contains at least 1 less integer than initially, r is a string containing a single character that is either '<' or not '<', the output ? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev] is printed for each iteration, where v1 is n-1, i is 1 and prev is 0, and r is not '>', and the current value of r is '='**
