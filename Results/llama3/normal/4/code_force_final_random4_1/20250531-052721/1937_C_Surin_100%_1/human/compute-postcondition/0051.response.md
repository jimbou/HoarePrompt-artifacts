Output State: **I is initial, R is initial, n is greater than 2, g is initial, kp is initial, v1 is initial, v2 is initial, i is 2, r is the input received, prev is 2, and the output "? [v1] 2 [v1] [prev]" has been printed to the console, and this is printed: "? 2 2 [prev] [prev]", and the output buffer has been flushed, and r2 is the newly received input.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables remain the same as in the initial state, except for the variable "prev" which is now assigned the value of "i", which is 2. The output buffer has been flushed, and the newly received input is stored in "r2".
