Output State: **kp is n+1, n is an integer that must be at least 2, I and R remain in their initial state, g is 0, v2 is n-1, i is 1, r2 is an empty string, r is an empty string, prev is 0, and the output buffer contains the string "? 0 0 1 1" followed by an empty line, and either "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" or "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" depending on the previous value of r, where v1 is either 0 or n-1 and v2 is n-1.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line, `sys.stdout.flush()`, flushes the output buffer, which means that any buffered output is immediately written to the output stream. In this case, the output buffer contains the string "? 0 0 1 1" followed by an empty line, and either "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" or "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" depending on the previous value of r, where v1 is either 0 or n-1 and v2 is n-1. After flushing the output buffer, the output buffer is empty.

The second line, `r2 = input('')`, reads a line of input from the user and assigns it to the variable r2. Since the current value of r is '=', the input prompt is printed as "? 1 1 0 0". The user input is read and assigned to r2, which becomes an empty string because the input is empty.

The values of kp, n, I, R, g, v2, i, and prev remain unchanged because they are not modified by the code snippet. The value of r is also unchanged because it is not assigned a new value. The output buffer is empty after the first line, and the second line does not modify it.
