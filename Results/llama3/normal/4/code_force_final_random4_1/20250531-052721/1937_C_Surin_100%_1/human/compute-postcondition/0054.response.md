Postcondition: **The program has processed the input `r` and updated the state of the variables accordingly. If `r` is '>', the previous value `prev` is set to 2. If `r` is '=', the output "? 2 2 [prev] [prev]" is printed, the output buffer is flushed, and a new input `r2` is received. If `r2` is '<', then `prev` is set to 2; otherwise, `prev` remains initial. If `r` is neither '>' nor '=', no additional actions are taken. In all cases, the output "? [v1] 2 [v1] [prev]" has been printed to the console, and the variables `I`, `R`, `n`, `g`, `kp`, `v1`, `v2`, and `i` remain in their initial state.**
