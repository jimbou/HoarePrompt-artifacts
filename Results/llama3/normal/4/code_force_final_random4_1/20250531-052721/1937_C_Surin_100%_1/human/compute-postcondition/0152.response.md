The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **The output buffer has been flushed again, `kp` is `n+1`, `n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `I` and `R` remain in their initial state, `g` is 0, `v2` is 1, `i` is 2, `r2` remains assigned the original value of the input, and this is printed: "? 0 0 1 1" followed by an empty line. If the current value of `r` is '<', then `v1` is 1; otherwise, `v1` remains 0.**
