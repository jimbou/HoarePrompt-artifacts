Postcondition: ***I is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into a list of integers, and returns the list, R is a lambda function that reads a single integer from stdin and returns it, n is an integer that must be at least 3, g is 0, kp is 0, i is 2, stdin contains at least 1 less integer than initially, r is a string containing a single character that is either '<' or not '<', and the output ? 0 0 1 1 is printed, and this is printed: ? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]. If r is '<', then v1 is 2 and v2 is 2. Otherwise, v1 is either 0 or 1 and v2 is 2.***
