The code defines two lambda functions, `I` and `R`, which are used to read input from stdin. The `I` function reads a line of input, splits it into a list of integers using spaces as delimiters, and returns the list. The `R` function reads a single integer from stdin and returns it.

Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains one input: an integer (greater than 0), the `R` function will read this integer and return it. The `I` function is not used in this code snippet.

After executing the code, the state of the variables is as follows:

* `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into a list of integers, and returns the list.
* `R` is a lambda function that reads a single integer from stdin and returns it.
* stdin is empty, as the single integer input has been read by the `R` function.

Output State: **I is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into a list of integers, and returns the list, R is a lambda function that reads a single integer from stdin and returns it, stdin is empty**
