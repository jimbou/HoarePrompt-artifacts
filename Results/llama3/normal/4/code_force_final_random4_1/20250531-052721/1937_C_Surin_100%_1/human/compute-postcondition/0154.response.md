Based on the initial state described, let's analyze the print statement step by step:

1. `v1` is either 1 or 0, depending on the current value of `r`. If `r` is '<', then `v1` is 1; otherwise, `v1` remains 0.
2. `v2` is explicitly stated to be 2.

Given this information, the print statement will output a string with the following structure:

`? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}`

Since `v2` is always 2, we can substitute that value directly. The value of `v1` depends on the condition related to `r`, but since we don't have the exact value of `r`, we'll describe the output based on the two possible scenarios for `v1`:

- If `r` is '<', then `v1` is 1, and the output will be: `? 1 1 2 2`
- If `r` is not '<', then `v1` remains 0, and the output will be: `? 0 0 2 2`

Since we cannot determine the exact value of `r` from the given information, we cannot provide a single, precise output. However, we can describe the output based on the condition:

Output: **? [v1] [v1] 2 2 (where v1 is 1 if r is '<', otherwise v1 is 0)**
