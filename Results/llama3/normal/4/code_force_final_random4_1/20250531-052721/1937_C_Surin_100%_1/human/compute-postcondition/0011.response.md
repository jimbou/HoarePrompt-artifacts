To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved. The loop head is `for i in range(1, n):`.

From the given state at the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `i` is 1
- `n` is an integer that must be at least 2

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 2, we can increment `i` by 1 to make it 2. The value of `n` remains the same, but we need to ensure that it is greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables (`I`, `R`, `g`, `kp`, `v1`, `v2`, `r`, and `stdin`) are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into a list of integers, and returns the list, `R` is a lambda function that reads a single integer from stdin and returns it, `n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `g` is 0, `kp` is 0, `v1` is 0, `v2` is 1, `i` is 2, `stdin` contains at least 1 less integer than initially, `r` is an empty string, and the output ? 0 0 1 1 is printed. If `r` is '<', then `v1` is 1, otherwise, `v1` remains 0.**
