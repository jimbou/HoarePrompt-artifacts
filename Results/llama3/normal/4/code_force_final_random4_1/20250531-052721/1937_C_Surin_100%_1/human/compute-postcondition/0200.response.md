Output State: **kp is n+1, n is an integer that must be at least 3, I and R remain in their initial state, g is 0, v2 is n-1, i is 3, r2 remains assigned the original value of the input if r is '>', otherwise r2 is either '<' if r is '=' or remains assigned the original value of the input, r is either a string containing the input value if r is '>' or an empty string if r is '=', prev is 3, and the output buffer contains the string "? 0 0 1 1" followed by an empty line, and either "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" or "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" depending on the previous value of r, where v1 is either 0 or n-1 and v2 is n-1. If r is '=', then this is printed: "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is either 0 or n-1, i is 2, and prev is either 0 or 1 or 2 depending on the value of r, and this is printed: "? 2 2 [prev] [prev]" where prev is either 0 or 1 or 2 depending on the value of r, and this is printed: "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is either 0 or n-1, i is 3, and prev is 3.**

In this output state, the value of `prev` has been updated to 3, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the output buffer still contains the same strings as before.
