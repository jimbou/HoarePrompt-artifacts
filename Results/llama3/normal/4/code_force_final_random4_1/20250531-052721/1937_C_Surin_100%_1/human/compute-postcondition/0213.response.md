Functionality: **The function reads an integer from standard input, then iterates through a range of numbers from 1 to the input integer. For each iteration, it prints a series of queries in the format "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" and reads the input values. Based on the input values, it updates the values of `prev` and `v1`. Finally, it prints a result in the format "! [prev] [v1]" and flushes the output buffer. The function repeats this process for a number of iterations specified by the initial input integer.**
