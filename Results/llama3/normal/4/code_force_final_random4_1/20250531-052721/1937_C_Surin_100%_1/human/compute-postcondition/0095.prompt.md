Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The output buffer has been flushed, and the output "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" has been printed for each iteration, and this is printed: "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is the last value of `i` that received a response of '>' or '=' with a subsequent response of '<', and v1 is the value of variable v1. The variable `kp` is `n`, and the variable `n` is at least `kp`. The variable `n` is an integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, and the variables `I`, `R`, and `v2` remain in their initial state.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    v2 = i
    print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
    sys.stdout.flush()
    r = input('')
    if r == '<':
        v1 = v2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *The output buffer has been flushed, and the output "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" has been printed for each iteration, and this is printed: "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is the last value of `i` that received a response of '>' or '=' with a subsequent response of '<', and v1 is the value of variable v1. The variable `kp` is `n`, and the variable `n` is at least `kp` and is at least 2. The variable `n` is an integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is either 0 or 1, and the variables `I`, `R` remain in their initial state, and `v2` is 1, and `i` is 1, and this is printed: '? 0 0 1 1', and the output buffer has been flushed again, and a string input has been read and stored in `r`. The current value of `r` is either '<' or not '<'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The output buffer has been flushed, and the output "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" has been printed for each iteration, and this is printed: "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is the last value of `i` that received a response of '>' or '=' with a subsequent response of '<', and v1 is the value of variable v1. The variable `kp` is `n`, and the variable `n` is at least `kp` and is at least 3. The variable `n` is an integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is either 0 or 1 or 2, and the variables `I`, `R` remain in their initial state, and `v2` is 2, and `i` is 2, and this is printed: '? 0 1 1 1', and the output buffer has been flushed again, and a string input has been read and stored in `r`. The current value of `r` is either '<' or not '<', and this is printed: '? 0 0 2 2', and the output buffer has been flushed again, and a new string input has been read and stored in `r`. If `r` is '<', then `v1` is 2, otherwise `v1` remains either 0 or 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The output buffer has been flushed, and the output "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" has been printed for each iteration, and this is printed: "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is the last value of `i` that received a response of '>' or '=' with a subsequent response of '<', and v1 is the value of variable v1. The variable `kp` is `n`, and the variable `n` is at least `kp` and is at least 3. The variable `n` is an integer, `g` is 0, and the variables `I`, `R` remain in their initial state, and `v2` is 3, and `i` is 3, and this is printed: '? 0 1 1 1', and the output buffer has been flushed again, and a string input has been read and stored in `r`. The current value of `r` is either '<' or not '<', and this is printed: '? 0 0 2 2', and the output buffer has been flushed again, and a new string input has been read and stored in `r`. If `r` is '<', then `v1` is 3, otherwise `v1` remains either 0 or 1 or 2, and `n` is greater than or equal to 3, and this is printed: '? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]' where v1 is either 0 or 1 or 2 or 3, and v2 is 3. The output buffer has been flushed again, and a new string input has been read and stored in `r`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
