Based on the initial state, the code prints a formatted string with the current values of `i` and `prev`. Since `i` is 1 and `prev` is 0, the output will be "? 1 1 0 0".

Here is the postcondition:

Output: **kp is n+1, n is an integer that must be at least 2, I and R remain in their initial state, g is 0, v2 is n-1, i is 1, r2 remains assigned the original value of the input, and r is a string containing the input value, prev is 0, and the output buffer contains the string "? 0 0 1 1" followed by an empty line, and either "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" or "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" depending on the previous value of r, where v1 is either 0 or n-1 and v2 is n-1. The current value of r is '=' , and this is printed: "? 1 1 0 0"**
