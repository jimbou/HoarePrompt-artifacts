Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: I is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into a list of integers, and returns the list, R is a lambda function that reads a single integer from stdin and returns it, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for kp in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    g = 0
    v1 = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        v2 = i
        print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
        sys.stdout.flush()
        r = input('')
        if r == '<':
            v1 = v2
    prev = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
        sys.stdout.flush()
        r = input()
        if r == '>':
            prev = i
        elif r == '=':
            print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
            sys.stdout.flush()
            r2 = input('')
            if r2 == '<':
                prev = i
    print(f'! {prev} {v1}')
    sys.stdout.flush()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The output buffer has been flushed, and the output "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" has been printed for each iteration, and this is printed: "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is the last value of `i` that received a response of '>' or '=' with a subsequent response of '<', and v1 is the value of variable v1. The variable `i` has reached its final value of `n-1`, and the variable `prev` has been updated to the last value of `i` that received a response of '>' or '=' with a subsequent response of '<'. The variables `I`, `R`, `n`, `g`, `kp`, `v1`, and `v2` remain in their initial state.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The output buffer has been flushed again. The variable `kp` remains `n`, and `n` is an integer. The variables `I` and `R` remain in their initial state, and `g` is 0. The variable `v2` is `n-1`, and `i` is `n-1`. If the input `r` is '>', then `v1` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or `n-2`, and `prev` is `n-1`. If the input `r` is '=', then `v1` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or `n-1`, and `prev` is `n-1` if `r2` is '<' and `n-2` otherwise. If the input `r` is '<', then `v1` is `n-1`, and `prev` is `n-1` if `r2` is not '<' and `n-1` if `r2` is '<'. The variable `r` has been assigned the value of the input. If the input `r` is '<', then the following is also printed: "? [n-1] [n-1] [prev] [prev]" where prev is `n-2` if the input `r` is '>' and `r2` is '<', `n-1` if the input `r` is '>' or '=' and `r2` is '<', and 0 if the input `r` is '<' and `r2` is not '<'. The variable `r2` has been assigned the value of the input. The following is printed: "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or `n-2` if the input `r` is '>', or `n-1` if the input `r` is '<', and `i` is `n-1`, and `prev` is `n-1` if the input `r` is '>' or '=' and `r2` is '<', and `n-1` if the input `r` is '<' and `r2` is not '<'. If `r` is '=', then the following is also printed: "? [i] [i] [prev] [prev]" where `i` is `n-1`, and `prev` is `n-2` if the input `r` is '>' or '=' and `r2` is '<', and 0 if the input `r` is '<' and `r2` is not '<'. The following is printed: "! [prev] [v1]" where `prev` is `n-1` if the input `r` is '>' or '=' and `r2` is '<', and `n-1` if the input `r` is '<' and `r2` is not '<', and `v1` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or `n-2` if the input `r` is '>', or `n-1` if the input `r` is '<'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The output buffer is flushed, kp is n+1, n is an integer that must be at least 1, I and R remain in their initial state, g is 0, v2 is n-1, i is n, r2 remains assigned the original value of the input, and r is either a string containing the input value if r is '>' or an empty string if r is '=', prev is either n if r is '>' or n-1 if r is '=' or 0 or n-1 if r2 is '<'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
