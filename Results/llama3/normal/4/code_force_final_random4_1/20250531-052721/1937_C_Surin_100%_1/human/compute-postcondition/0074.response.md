Output State: **The output buffer has been flushed, and the output "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" has been printed for each iteration, and this is printed: "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is the last value of `i` that received a response of '>' or '=' with a subsequent response of '<', and v1 is the value of variable v1. The variable `kp` is `n`, and the variable `n` is at least `kp` and is at least 2. The variable `n` is an integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, and the variables `I`, `R` remain in their initial state, and `v2` is 1, and `i` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the variable `v2` has been assigned the value of `i`, which is 1. The output buffer has been flushed, and the output messages have been printed as before. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
