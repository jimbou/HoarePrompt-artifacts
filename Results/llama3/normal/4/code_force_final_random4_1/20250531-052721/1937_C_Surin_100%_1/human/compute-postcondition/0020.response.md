The code prints a formatted string containing the values of `v1` and `v2`. The value of `v2` is 3. The value of `v1` depends on the value of `r`. If `r` is '<', then `v1` is 2. Otherwise, `v1` is either 0 or 1.

Output: **? [v1] [v1] [3] [3] (where v1 is 2 if r is '<', otherwise v1 is either 0 or 1)**
