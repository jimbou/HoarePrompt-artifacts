Postcondition: ***`kp` is `n+1`, `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `I` and `R` remain in their initial state, `g` is 0, `v2` is `n-1`, `i` is 1, if `r2` is '<', then `r2` is '<', `r` is an empty string, `prev` is 1, and the output buffer contains the string "? 0 0 1 1" followed by an empty line, and either "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" or "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" depending on the previous value of `r`, where `v1` is either 0 or `n-1` and `v2` is `n-1`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
