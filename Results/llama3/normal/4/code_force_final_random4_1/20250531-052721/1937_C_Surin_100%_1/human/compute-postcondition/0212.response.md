Output State: **The output buffer has been flushed, the variables `I`, `R`, `g`, and `kp` remain in their initial state, `n` is an integer, `v2` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `r` and `r2` are strings containing the input values, and `prev` and `v1` are integers between 0 and `n-1`. The following has been printed for each iteration: "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" and "! [prev] [v1]".**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the output buffer has been flushed, and the variables `I`, `R`, `g`, and `kp` remain unchanged. The variable `n` is an integer, and `v2` is `n-1`. The variable `i` is `n-1`, and `r` and `r2` are strings containing the input values. The variables `prev` and `v1` are integers between 0 and `n-1`. For each iteration, the following has been printed: "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" and "! [prev] [v1]".
