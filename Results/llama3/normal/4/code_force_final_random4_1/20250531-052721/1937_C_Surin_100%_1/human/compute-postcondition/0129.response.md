Output State: **The variable `prev` is now 3, and the values of the other variables remain the same. The program has executed the if-else block, and the output buffer has been flushed. The variable `kp` remains `n`, and `n` is at least 4 and an integer. The variables `I` and `R` remain in their initial state, and `g` is 0. The variable `v2` is `n-1`, and `i` is 3. If the input `r` is '>', then `v1` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or `n-2`, and `prev` is 3. If the input `r` is '=', then the program executes the if block, and if the input `r2` is '<', then `v1` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or `n-1`, and `prev` is 3. Otherwise, if the input `r` is '<', then `v1` is `n-1`, and `prev` is 3 if `r2` is not '<' and 3 if `r2` is '<'. The variable `r` has been assigned the value of the input. If the input `r` is '<', then the following is also printed: "? 2 2 [prev] [prev]" where prev is 1 if the input `r` is '>' and `r2` is '<', 2 if the input `r` is '>' or '=' and `r2` is '<', and 0 if the input `r` is '<' and `r2` is not '<'. The variable `r2` has been assigned the value of the input. The following is printed: "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or `n-2` if the input `r` is '>', or `n-1` if the input `r` is '<', and `i` is 3, and `prev` is 3 if the input `r` is '>' or '=' and `r2` is '<', and 3 if the input `r` is '<' and `r2` is not '<'. The output buffer has been flushed again.**

In natural language, the output state is that the variable `prev` has been updated to 3, and all other variables remain unchanged. The program has executed the if-else block, and the output buffer has been flushed. The values of `kp`, `n`, `I`, `R`, `g`, `v2`, and `i` remain the same. The value of `v1` and `prev` depend on the input `r` and `r2`. The output buffer has been flushed again.
