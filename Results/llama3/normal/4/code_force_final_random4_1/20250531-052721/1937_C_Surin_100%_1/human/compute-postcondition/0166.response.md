Output State: **The output buffer has been flushed again, `kp` is `n+1`, `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `I` and `R` remain in their initial state, `g` is 0, `v2` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `r2` remains assigned the original value of the input, and `r` is an empty string. The output buffer contains the string "? 0 0 1 1" followed by an empty line, and either "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" or "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" depending on the previous value of `r`, where `v1` is either 0 or `n-1` and `v2` is `n-1`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The output buffer has been flushed again, and the value of `kp` is `n+1`, where `n` is an integer that must be at least 1. The values of `I` and `R` remain unchanged, and `g` is still 0. The value of `v2` is `n-1`, and the value of `i` is also `n-1`. The value of `r2` remains the same as the original input, and the value of `r` is an empty string.

The output buffer contains the string "? 0 0 1 1" followed by an empty line, and either "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" or "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" depending on the previous value of `r`. The value of `v1` is either 0 or `n-1`, and the value of `v2` is `n-1`.
