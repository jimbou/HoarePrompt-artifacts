Based on the initial state, the variables `prev`, `I`, `R`, `n`, `g`, `kp`, `v1`, and `v2` are in their initial state, which means their values are not explicitly defined. The variable `i` is explicitly defined as 2.

The `print` statement is a formatted string that includes the value of `i` twice, as well as the value of `prev` twice. Since `prev` is in its initial state, its value is not explicitly defined.

Therefore, the output will be a string that includes the value of `i` (which is 2) twice, and the value of `prev` (which is not explicitly defined) twice.

Output: **? 2 2 [prev] [prev] (where [prev] is the value of prev, which is not explicitly defined)**
