Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the required logic to find any two indices i and j such that p_i âŠ• p_j is maximized. The program uses a series of queries to compare the bitwise OR of pairs of numbers and updates the values of `prev` and `v1` accordingly. Finally, it prints the result in the required format.

The program also correctly handles the flushing of the output buffer after each print statement to ensure that the output is displayed immediately.

Correctness: **True**
