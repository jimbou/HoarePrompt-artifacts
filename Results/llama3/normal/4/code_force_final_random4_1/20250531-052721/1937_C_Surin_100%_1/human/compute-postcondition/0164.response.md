Output State: **The output buffer has been flushed again, `kp` is `n+1`, `n` is an integer that must be at least 4, `I` and `R` remain in their initial state, `g` is 0, `v2` is 3, `i` is 3, `r2` remains assigned the original value of the input, `v1` is 3, and `r` is an empty string. The output buffer contains the string "? 0 0 1 1" followed by an empty line, and either "? 0 0 3 3" or "? 2 2 3 3" depending on the previous value of `r`.**

In this output state, the value of `v1` has been updated to 3, which is the value of `v2`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the output buffer still contains the same strings.
