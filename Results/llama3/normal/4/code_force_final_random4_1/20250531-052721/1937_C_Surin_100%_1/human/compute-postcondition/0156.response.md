Output State: **The output buffer has been flushed again, `kp` is `n+1`, `n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `I` and `R` remain in their initial state, `g` is 0, `v2` is 2, `i` is 2, `r2` remains assigned the original value of the input, and this is printed: "? 0 0 1 1" followed by an empty line. If the current value of `r` is '<', then `v1` is 1; otherwise, `v1` remains 0. and this is printed: "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" where v1 is 1 if r is '<' otherwise v1 is 0 and v2 is 2, `r` is an empty string**
