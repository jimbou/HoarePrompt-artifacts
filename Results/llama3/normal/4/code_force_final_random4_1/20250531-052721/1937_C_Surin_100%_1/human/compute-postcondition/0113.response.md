The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **The program has executed the if-else block, and the output buffer has been flushed. The variable `kp` remains `n`, and `n` is at least 3 and an integer. The variables `I` and `R` remain in their initial state, and `g` is 0. The variable `v2` is `n-1`, and `i` is 2. If the input `r` is '>', then `v1` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or `n-2`, and `prev` is 1. If the input `r` is '=', then the program executes the if block, and if the input `r2` is '<', then `prev` is 1, and the output "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" has been printed for each iteration, where `v1` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or `n-1`, and `prev` is 1. Otherwise, if the input `r` is '<', then `v1` is `n-1`, and `prev` is 0.**
