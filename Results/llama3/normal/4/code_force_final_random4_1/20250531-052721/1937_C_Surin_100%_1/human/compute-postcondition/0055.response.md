The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is in its initial state and `n` is in its initial state. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`r` is in its initial state, `prev` is in its initial state, `I` is in its initial state, `R` is in its initial state, `n` is in its initial state and must be greater than 2, `g` is in its initial state, `kp` is in its initial state, `v1` is in its initial state, `v2` is in its initial state, `i` is 2**
