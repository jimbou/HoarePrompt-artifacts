Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It uses a binary search approach to find the maximum XOR value between any two indices in the secret sequence.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the program's logic:

1. The program first finds the index `v1` that has the maximum value in the sequence. This is done by comparing each index `i` with `v1` using the query `? v1 v1 i i`. If the result is `<`, it means `i` has a larger value, so `v1` is updated to `i`.

2. Once `v1` is found, the program then finds the index `prev` that has the maximum XOR value with `v1`. This is done by comparing each index `i` with `prev` using the query `? v1 i v1 prev`. If the result is `>`, it means `i` has a larger XOR value with `v1`, so `prev` is updated to `i`. If the result is `=`, it means `i` has the same XOR value with `v1` as `prev`, so the program checks which one has a larger value using the query `? i i prev prev`. If `i` has a larger value, `prev` is updated to `i`.

3. Finally, the program prints the indices `prev` and `v1` as the answer.

The program uses at most 3n queries, which is within the allowed limit. The queries are also correctly formatted and the output is correctly printed.

Correctness: **True**
