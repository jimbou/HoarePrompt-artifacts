Postcondition: ***I is initial, R is initial, n is greater than 2, g is initial, kp is initial, v1 is initial, v2 is initial, i is 2, r is the input received, and the output "? [v1] 2 [v1] [prev]" has been printed to the console. If r is '=', then the output "? 2 2 [prev] [prev]" is printed, the output buffer is flushed, and a new input r2 is received. If r2 is '<', then prev is 2; otherwise, prev remains initial. If r is not '=', then no additional actions are taken.***
