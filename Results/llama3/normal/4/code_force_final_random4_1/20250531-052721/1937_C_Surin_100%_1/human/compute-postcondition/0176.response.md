Based on the initial state, the print statement will print a formatted string containing the values of `i` and `prev`.

The value of `i` is 1, as specified in the initial state.

The value of `prev` is 0, as specified in the initial state.

Therefore, the print statement will output the string "? 1 1 0 0".

Output: **? 1 1 0 0**
