Based on the initial state, the print statement will print a formatted string containing the values of `v1`, `i`, `v1`, and `prev`.

The value of `v1` is either 0 or n-1, but since `n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `v1` can be either 0 or 2 (since n-1 is 2 when n is 3). However, the exact value of `v1` is not specified, so we will leave it as "either 0 or n-1".

The value of `i` is 3, as specified in the initial state.

The value of `prev` depends on the value of `r2`. If `r2` is '<', then `prev` is either 0 or 2. If `r2` is not '<', then `prev` is either 1 or 2. However, the exact value of `prev` is not specified, so we will leave it as "either 0, 1, or 2".

Therefore, the print statement will output a string in the format "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]", where `v1` is either 0 or n-1, `i` is 3, and `prev` is either 0, 1, or 2.

Output: **? [either 0 or n-1] 3 [either 0 or n-1] [either 0, 1, or 2]**
