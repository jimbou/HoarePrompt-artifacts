Output State: **`kp` is `n+1`, `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `I` and `R` remain in their initial state, `g` is 0, `v2` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `r2` remains assigned the original value of the input, and `r` is an empty string. The output buffer contains the string "? 0 0 1 1" followed by an empty line, and either "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" or "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" depending on the previous value of `r`, where `v1` is either 0 or `n-1` and `v2` is `n-1`. `prev` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `prev` which is assigned the value 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
