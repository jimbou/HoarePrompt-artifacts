Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: I is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into a list of integers, and returns the list, R is a lambda function that reads a single integer from stdin and returns it, n is an integer, g is 0, v1 is 0, kp is 0, stdin contains at least 1 less integer than initially
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    v2 = i
    print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
    sys.stdout.flush()
    r = input('')
    if r == '<':
        v1 = v2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *I is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into a list of integers, and returns the list, R is a lambda function that reads a single integer from stdin and returns it, n is an integer that must be at least 2, g is 0, kp is 0, v1 is 0, v2 is 1, i is 1, stdin contains at least 1 less integer than initially, r is an empty string, and the output ? 0 0 1 1 is printed. If r is '<', then v1 is 1, otherwise, v1 remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *I is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into a list of integers, and returns the list, R is a lambda function that reads a single integer from stdin and returns it, n is an integer that must be at least 3, g is 0, kp is 0, i is 2, stdin contains at least 1 less integer than initially, r is a string containing a single character that is either '<' or not '<', and the output ? 0 0 1 1 is printed, and this is printed: ? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]. If r is '<', then v1 is 2 and v2 is 2. Otherwise, v1 is either 0 or 1 and v2 is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The program executes with the given preconditions and prints the output ? 0 0 1 1. If the character `r` is '<', then the output ? [3] [3] [3] [3] is printed, and the values of `v1` and `v2` are updated to 3. If `r` is not '<', no changes are made to the values of `v1` and `v2`. The program maintains the initial values of `I`, `R`, `n`, `g`, `kp`, and `i` throughout the execution.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
