Output State: **I is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into a list of integers, and returns the list, R is a lambda function that reads a single integer from stdin and returns it, n is an integer, g is 0, kp is 0, v1 is n-1, v2 is n-1, i is n-1, stdin contains at least 1 less integer than initially, r is a string containing a single character that is either '<' or not '<', and the output ? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2] is printed for each iteration.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the values of `v1` and `v2` are updated to `n-1`, where `n` is the number of iterations. The loop prints the output `? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]` for each iteration, and the values of `I`, `R`, `g`, `kp`, and `i` remain unchanged. The loop also consumes at least one less integer from `stdin` than initially.
