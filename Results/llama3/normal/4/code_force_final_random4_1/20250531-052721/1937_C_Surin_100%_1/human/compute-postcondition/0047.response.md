Output State: **`I` is initial, `R` is initial, `n` is greater than 2, `g` is initial, `kp` is initial, `v1` is initial, `v2` is initial, `i` is 2, `r` is the input received, `prev` is 2, and the output "? [v1] 2 [v1] [prev]" has been printed to the console.**

In this output state, the value of `prev` has been updated to 2, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the output to the console is still the same.
