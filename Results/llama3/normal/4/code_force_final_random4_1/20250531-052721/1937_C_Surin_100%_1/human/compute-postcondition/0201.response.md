Based on the precondition, we can determine the values of the variables involved in the print statement.

The print statement is: `print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')`

From the precondition, we know that:
- `i` is 3
- `prev` is either 2 if `r` is '>' or 1 if `r` is '=' or 0 or 2 if `r2` is '<'

Since `r` is either '>' or '=', we can conclude that `prev` is either 2 (if `r` is '>') or 1 (if `r` is '=').

Therefore, the print statement will output a string with the following values:
- `i` is 3
- `prev` is either 2 or 1

Output: **? 3 3 2 2 or ? 3 3 1 1**
