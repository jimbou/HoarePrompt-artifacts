Postcondition: **The program executes with the given preconditions and prints the output ? 0 0 1 1. If the character `r` is '<', then the output ? [3] [3] [3] [3] is printed, and the values of `v1` and `v2` are updated to 3. If `r` is not '<', no changes are made to the values of `v1` and `v2`. The program maintains the initial values of `I`, `R`, `n`, `g`, `kp`, and `i` throughout the execution.**
