The code prints a formatted string indicating the values of `v1` and `v2`. Where `v1` is either 0, 1, or 2 depending on the value of `r`, and `v2` is 3.
Output: ** `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into a list of integers, and returns the list, `R` is a lambda function that reads a single integer from stdin and returns it, `n` is an integer that must be at least 4, `g` is 0, `kp` is 0, `i` is 3, `v2` is 3, `r` is a string containing a single character that is either '<' or not '<', and the output ? 0 0 1 1 is printed, and this is printed: ? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]. If `r` is '<', then `v1` is 2. Otherwise, `v1` is either 0 or 1. and this is printed: ? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2] where v1 is either 0, 1, or 2 and v2 is 3**
