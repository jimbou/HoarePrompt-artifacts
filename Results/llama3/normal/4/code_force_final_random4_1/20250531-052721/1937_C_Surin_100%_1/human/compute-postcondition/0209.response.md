Based on the precondition, the print statement will print a string that includes the values of `prev` and `v1`.

The value of `prev` depends on the value of `r` and `r2`. If `r` is '>', then `prev` is `n`. If `r` is '=', then `prev` is `n-1`. If `r2` is '<', then `prev` is either `0` or `n-1`.

The value of `v1` is either `0` or `n-1`.

Therefore, the print statement will output a string in the format "! [prev] [v1]", where `[prev]` is either `n`, `n-1`, `0`, or `n-1` depending on the values of `r` and `r2`, and `[v1]` is either `0` or `n-1`.

Output: **! [prev] [v1] (where prev is either n, n-1, 0, or n-1 depending on the values of r and r2, and v1 is either 0 or n-1)**
