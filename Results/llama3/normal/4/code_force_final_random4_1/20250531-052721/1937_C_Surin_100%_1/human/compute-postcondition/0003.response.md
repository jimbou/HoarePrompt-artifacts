According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer, but it does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 2 and `i` is now 1.
State: **I is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into a list of integers, and returns the list, R is a lambda function that reads a single integer from stdin and returns it, n is an integer that must be at least 2, g is 0, v1 is 0, kp is 0, stdin contains at least 1 less integer than initially, i is 1**
