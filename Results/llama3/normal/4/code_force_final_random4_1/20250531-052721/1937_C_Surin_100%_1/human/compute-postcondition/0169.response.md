Based on the precondition, let's analyze the variables and objects involved in the print statement:

* `v1` is either 0 or `n-1`, but its exact value is not specified.
* `i` is 1.
* `prev` is 0.

The print statement is: `print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')`

Since `v1` can be either 0 or `n-1`, we can't determine its exact value. However, we can describe its value using the given information.

Output: **? [v1] 1 [v1] 0 (where v1 is either 0 or n-1)**
