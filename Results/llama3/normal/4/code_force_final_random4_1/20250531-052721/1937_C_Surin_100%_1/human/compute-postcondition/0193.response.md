Postcondition: **kp is n+1, n is an integer that must be at least 2, I and R remain in their initial state, g is 0, v2 is n-1, i is 2, r2 is an empty string, r is a string containing the input value, prev is either 1 if r is '>' or '=' otherwise prev is 0 or 2 if r2 is '<', and the output buffer contains the string "? 0 0 1 1" followed by an empty line, and either "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" or "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" depending on the previous value of r, where v1 is either 0 or n-1 and v2 is n-1. If r is '=', then r2 is '<', r is an empty string, and this is printed: "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is either 0 or n-1, i is 2, and prev is either 0 or 1 or 2 depending on the value of r, and this is printed: "? 2 2 [prev] [prev]" where prev is either 0 or 1 or 2 depending on the value of r.**
