Output State: **`I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into a list of integers, and returns the list, `R` is a lambda function that reads a single integer from stdin and returns it, `n` is an integer that must be at least 4, `g` is 0, `kp` is 0, `i` is 3, `v2` is 3, `r` is a string containing a single character that is either '<' or not '<', and the output ? 0 0 1 1 is printed, and this is printed: ? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]. If `r` is '<', then `v1` is 2. Otherwise, `v1` is either 0 or 1.**

In this output state, the value of `v2` has been updated to 3, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the output messages are still printed as specified. The value of `v1` is still dependent on the value of `r`, which can be either '<' or not '<'.
