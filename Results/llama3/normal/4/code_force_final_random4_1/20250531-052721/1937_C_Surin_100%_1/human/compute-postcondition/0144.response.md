To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 2, since the range starts from 1 and goes up to but does not include `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be at least 2. The state of `i` should be adjusted to be 1, since that is the starting value of the range.

State: **The output buffer has been flushed again, `kp` is `n+1`, `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `I` and `R` remain in their initial state, `g` is 0, `v2` is `n-1`, `i` is 1, `r` has been assigned the value of the input, `r2` has been assigned the value of the input, `v1` is 0**
