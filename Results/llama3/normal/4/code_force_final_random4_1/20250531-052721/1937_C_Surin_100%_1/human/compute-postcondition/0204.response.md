Output State: **`kp` is `n+1`, `n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `I` and `R` remain in their initial state, `g` is 0, `v2` is `n-1`, `i` is 3, `r2` is either '<' if `r` is '=' or remains assigned the original value of the input, `r` is either a string containing the input value if `r` is '>' or an empty string if `r` is '=', `prev` is 3, and the output buffer contains the string "? 0 0 1 1" followed by an empty line, and either "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" or "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" depending on the previous value of `r`, where `v1` is either 0 or `n-1` and `v2` is `n-1`. If `r` is '=', then this is printed: "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where `v1` is either 0 or `n-1`, `i` is 2, and `prev` is either 0 or 1 or 2 depending on the value of `r`, and this is printed: "? 2 2 [prev] [prev]" where `prev` is either 0 or 1 or 2 depending on the value of `r`, and this is printed: "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where `v1` is either 0 or `n-1`, `i` is 3, and `prev` is 3, and this is printed: "? 3 3 [prev] [prev]" where `prev` is 3.**

In natural language, the output state is: `kp` is still `n+1`, `n` is still an integer that must be at least 3, `I` and `R` remain unchanged, `g` is still 0, `v2` is still `n-1`, `i` is still 3, `r2` is still either '<' if `r` is '=' or remains assigned the original value of the input, `r` is still either a string containing the input value if `r` is '>' or an empty string if `r` is '=', and `prev` is now 3. The output buffer still contains the same strings as before, with the only change being that `prev` is now 3 in the last two printed strings.
