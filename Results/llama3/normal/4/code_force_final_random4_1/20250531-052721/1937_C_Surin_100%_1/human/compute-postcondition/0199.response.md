Output State: **kp is n+1, n is an integer that must be at least 3, I and R remain in their initial state, g is 0, v2 is n-1, i is 3, r2 remains assigned the original value of the input if r is '>', otherwise r2 is either '<' if r is '=' or remains assigned the original value of the input, r is either a string containing the input value if r is '>' or an empty string if r is '=', prev is either 2 if r is '>' or 1 if r is '=' or 0 or 2 if r2 is '<', and the output buffer contains the string "? 0 0 1 1" followed by an empty line, and either "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" or "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" depending on the previous value of r, where v1 is either 0 or n-1 and v2 is n-1. If r is '=', then this is printed: "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is either 0 or n-1, i is 2, and prev is either 0 or 1 or 2 depending on the value of r, and this is printed: "? 2 2 [prev] [prev]" where prev is either 0 or 1 or 2 depending on the value of r, and this is printed: "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is either 0 or n-1, i is 3, and prev is either 2 if r is '>' or 1 if r is '=' or 0 or 2 if r2 is '<'.**

The code first flushes the output buffer, which clears any pending output. Then, it reads a line of input from the user and assigns it to the variable `r`. The value of `r` depends on the input provided by the user. If the input is '>', then `r` will be a string containing the input value. If the input is '=', then `r` will be an empty string. The value of `r2` also depends on the input. If the input is '>', then `r2` will remain assigned the original value of the input. If the input is '=', then `r2` will be either '<' or remain assigned the original value of the input. The value of `prev` depends on the value of `r` and `r2`. If `r` is '>', then `prev` will be 2. If `r` is '=', then `prev` will be 1. If `r2` is '<', then `prev` will be 0 or 2. The output buffer contains several strings that depend on the previous value of `r` and the values of `v1`, `v2`, `i`, and `prev`.
