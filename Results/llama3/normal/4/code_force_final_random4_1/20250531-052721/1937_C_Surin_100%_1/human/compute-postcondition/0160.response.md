Output State: **The output buffer has been flushed again, `kp` is `n+1`, `n` is an integer that must be at least 4, `I` and `R` remain in their initial state, `g` is 0, `v2` is 3, `i` is 3, `r2` remains assigned the original value of the input, and this is printed: "? 0 0 1 1" followed by an empty line. If the current value of `r` is '<', then `v1` is 2 and this is printed: "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" where v1 is 2 and v2 is 3. Otherwise, `v1` remains 0 and this is printed: "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" where v1 is 0 and v2 is 3. In both cases, `r` is an empty string.**

Explanation: The code only changes the value of `v2` to the value of `i`, which is 3. All other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
