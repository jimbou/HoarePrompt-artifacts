Output State: **The variable `prev` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 3. The values of the other variables are not affected. The variable `kp` remains `n`, and `n` is at least 4 and an integer. The variables `I` and `R` remain in their initial state, and `g` is 0. The variable `v2` is `n-1`. If the input `r` is '>', then `v1` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or `n-2`. If the input `r` is '=', then the program executes the if block, and if the input `r2` is '<', then `v1` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or `n-1`. Otherwise, if the input `r` is '<', then `v1` is `n-1`. The variable `r` has been assigned the value of the input. The variable `r2` has been assigned the value of the input.**

In natural language, the output state is that the variable `prev` is now equal to 3, which is the value of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged, including `kp`, `n`, `I`, `R`, `g`, `v2`, `v1`, `r`, and `r2`, which retain their previous values and conditions.
