Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The output buffer has been flushed again. The variable `kp` is `n+1`, and `n` is an integer. The variables `I` and `R` remain in their initial state, and `g` is 0. The variable `v2` is `n-1`, and `i` is `n-1`. The variable `r` has been assigned the value of the input. The variable `r2` has been assigned the value of the input. The variable `v1` is 0. The variable `n` is an integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    v2 = i
    print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
    sys.stdout.flush()
    r = input('')
    if r == '<':
        v1 = v2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The output buffer has been flushed again, `kp` is `n+1`, `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `I` and `R` remain in their initial state, `g` is 0, `v2` is 1, `i` is 1, `r2` remains assigned the original value of the input, and this is printed: "? 0 0 1 1" followed by an empty line. If the current value of `r` is '<', then `v1` is 1; otherwise, `v1` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *The output buffer has been flushed again, `kp` is `n+1`, `n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `I` and `R` remain in their initial state, `g` is 0, `v2` is 2, `i` is 2, `r2` remains assigned the original value of the input, and this is printed: "? 0 0 1 1" followed by an empty line. If the current value of `r` is '<', then `v1` is 2 and this is printed: "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" where v1 is 2 and v2 is 2. Otherwise, `v1` remains 0 and this is printed: "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" where v1 is 0 and v2 is 2. In both cases, `r` is an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *The output buffer has been flushed again, `kp` is `n+1`, `n` is an integer that must be at least 4, `I` and `R` remain in their initial state, `g` is 0, `v2` is 3, `i` is 3, `r2` remains assigned the original value of the input, and `r` is an empty string. The output buffer contains the string "? 0 0 1 1" followed by an empty line, and either "? 0 0 3 3" or "? 2 2 3 3" depending on the previous value of `r`. If `r` was '<', then `v1` is 3; otherwise, `v1` is either 0 or 2 depending on the previous value of `r`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
