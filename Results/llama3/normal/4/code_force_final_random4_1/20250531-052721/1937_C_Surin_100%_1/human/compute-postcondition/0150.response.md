Output State: **The output buffer has been flushed again, `kp` is `n+1`, `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `I` and `R` remain in their initial state, `g` is 0, `v2` is 1, `i` is 1, `r2` remains assigned the original value of the input, `v1` is 1, and this is printed: "? 0 0 1 1" followed by an empty line. The current value of `r` is '<'.**

In this output state, the only change is that `v1` is now assigned the value of `v2`, which is 1. All other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
