Postcondition: **The program has executed the if-else block, and the output buffer has been flushed. The variable `kp` remains `n`, and `n` is at least 2 and an integer. The variables `I` and `R` remain in their initial state, and `g` is 0. The variable `v2` is `n-1`, and `i` is 1. If the input `r` is '>', then `v1` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or `n-2`, and `prev` is 1. If the input `r` is '=', then the program executes the if block, and if the input `r2` is '<', then `prev` is 1, and the output "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" has been printed for each iteration, where `v1` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or `n-1`, and `prev` is 1. Otherwise, if the input `r` is '<', then `v1` is `n-1`, and `prev` is 0.**
