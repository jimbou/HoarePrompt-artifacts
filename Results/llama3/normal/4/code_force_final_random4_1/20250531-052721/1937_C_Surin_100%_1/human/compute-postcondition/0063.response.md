Output State: **`r` is a string containing the user's response to the printed message, `prev` is 2, `I` is in its initial state, `R` is in its initial state, `n` is in its initial state and must be greater than 2, `g` is in its initial state, `kp` is in its initial state, `v1` is in its initial state, `v2` is in its initial state, `i` is 2, `r2` is a string containing the user's response to the input prompt, and stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `prev` has been updated to 2, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains no input.
