Output State: **`I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into a list of integers, and returns the list, `R` is a lambda function that reads a single integer from stdin and returns it, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `kp` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, `i` is 1, `prev` is 1, `r` is a string containing a single character that is either '<' or not '<', `r2` is a string containing a single character that is '<', and the output ? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev] is printed for each iteration, where `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is 1 and `prev` is 1, and `r` is not '>', and the current value of `r` is '=', and this is printed: ? 1 1 1 1, and the current value of `r2` is '<'.**

In this output state, the value of `prev` has been updated to 1, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The output ? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev] is printed for each iteration, and the current output is ? 1 1 1 1. The values of `r` and `r2` are still '=' and '<', respectively.
