According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `kp` and the input. If the input is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, I is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into a list of integers, and returns the list, R is a lambda function that reads a single integer from stdin and returns it, stdin is empty does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `kp` is 0 and input is at least 1.
State: **I is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into a list of integers, and returns the list, R is a lambda function that reads a single integer from stdin and returns it, stdin is not empty and has at least 1 integer, kp is 0**
