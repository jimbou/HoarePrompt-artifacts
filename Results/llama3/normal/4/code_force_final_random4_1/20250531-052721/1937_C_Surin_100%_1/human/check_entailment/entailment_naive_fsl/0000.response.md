Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it follows the problem description and handles all potential cases. The program first finds the index `v1` of the maximum value in the permutation `p` by comparing each element with the current maximum. Then, it finds the index `prev` of the minimum value in the permutation `p` by comparing each element with the current minimum. Finally, it prints the indices `prev` and `v1` as the pair of indices that maximizes the XOR operation.

The program uses at most 3n queries, which is within the allowed limit. The queries are used to compare the maximum and minimum values in the permutation, and to find the indices of these values.

The program handles all potential cases, including the case where the permutation is already sorted in ascending or descending order. In these cases, the program will still find the correct pair of indices that maximizes the XOR operation.

Overall, the program is correct and should work as expected for all potential cases.
