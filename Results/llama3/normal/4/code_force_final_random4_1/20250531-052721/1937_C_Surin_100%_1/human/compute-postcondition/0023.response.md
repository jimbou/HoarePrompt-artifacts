Output State: **`I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into a list of integers, and returns the list, `R` is a lambda function that reads a single integer from stdin and returns it, `n` is an integer that must be at least 4, `g` is 0, `kp` is 0, `i` is 3, `v1` is 3, `v2` is 3, `r` is a string containing a single character that is either '<' or not '<', and the output ? 0 0 1 1 is printed, and this is printed: ? [3] [3] [3] [3].**

In this output state, the value of `v1` has been updated to be equal to `v2`, which is 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The output statements have been updated to reflect the new value of `v1`.
