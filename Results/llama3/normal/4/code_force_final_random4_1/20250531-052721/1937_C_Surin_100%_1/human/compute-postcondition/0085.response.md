Output State: **The output buffer has been flushed, and the output "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" has been printed for each iteration, and this is printed: "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is the last value of `i` that received a response of '>' or '=' with a subsequent response of '<', and v1 is the value of variable v1. The variable `kp` is `n`, and the variable `n` is at least `kp` and is at least 3. The variable `n` is an integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is either 0 or 1, and the variables `I`, `R` remain in their initial state, and `v2` is 2, and `i` is 2, and this is printed: '? 0 1 1 1', and the output buffer has been flushed again, and a string input has been read and stored in `r`. The current value of `r` is either '<' or not '<', and this is printed: '? 0 0 2 2', and the output buffer has been flushed again, and a new string input has been read and stored in `r`.**
