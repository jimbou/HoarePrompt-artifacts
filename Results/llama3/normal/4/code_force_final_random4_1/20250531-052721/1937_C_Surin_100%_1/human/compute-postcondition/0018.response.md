To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved in it. The loop head is `for i in range(1, n):`.

From the given state at the end of the previous iteration:

* `i` is 2
* `n` is an integer that must be at least 3

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is currently 2, it needs to be incremented by 1 to 3 for the loop to continue. Additionally, `n` must still be greater than 3 to ensure the loop can execute again.

The other variables and states (`I`, `R`, `g`, `kp`, `r`, `stdin`, and the output) are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into a list of integers, and returns the list, `R` is a lambda function that reads a single integer from stdin and returns it, `n` is an integer that must be at least 4, `g` is 0, `kp` is 0, `i` is 3, `stdin` contains at least 1 less integer than initially, `r` is a string containing a single character that is either '<' or not '<', and the output ? 0 0 1 1 is printed, and this is printed: ? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]. If `r` is '<', then `v1` is 2 and `v2` is 2. Otherwise, `v1` is either 0 or 1 and `v2` is 2.**
