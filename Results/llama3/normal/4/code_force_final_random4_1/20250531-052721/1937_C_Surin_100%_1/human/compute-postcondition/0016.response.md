Output State: **I is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into a list of integers, and returns the list, R is a lambda function that reads a single integer from stdin and returns it, n is an integer that must be at least 3, g is 0, kp is 0, v1 is 2, v2 is 2, i is 2, stdin contains at least 1 less integer than initially, r is a string containing a single character that is either '<' or not '<', and the output ? 0 0 1 1 is printed, and this is printed: ? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2] where v1 is 2 and v2 is 2.**

In this output state, the value of v1 has been updated to 2, which is the same as the value of v2. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The output still shows ? 0 0 1 1 and ? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2] with v1 and v2 both being 2.
