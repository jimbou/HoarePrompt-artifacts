Based on the precondition, the print statement will print a string with the following values:

* `i` is 2, as stated in the precondition.
* `prev` is either 1 or 0, depending on the input `r` and `r2`. If `r` is '>' or '=' and `r2` is '<', then `prev` is 1. If `r` is '<', then `prev` is 0.

Therefore, the output will be one of the following two possibilities:

* If `prev` is 1: "? 2 2 1 1"
* If `prev` is 0: "? 2 2 0 0"

Output: **? 2 2 [prev] [prev] (where prev is either 1 or 0, depending on the input r and r2)**
