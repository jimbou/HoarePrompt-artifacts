Output State: **`I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into a list of integers, and returns the list, `R` is a lambda function that reads a single integer from stdin and returns it, `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `g` is 0, `kp` is 0, `v1` is 1, `v2` is 1, `i` is 1, stdin contains at least 1 less integer than initially, the current value of r is '<', and the output ? 0 0 1 1 is printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The lambda functions `I` and `R` remain unchanged. The values of `n`, `g`, `kp`, and `i` also remain the same. However, the value of `v1` is now equal to `v2`, which is 1. The state of the stdin and the output remain unchanged.
