Based on the precondition, we can analyze the print statement as follows:

* `v1` is either 0 or n-1, but its exact value is not specified. Therefore, we will describe it as "either 0 or n-1".
* `i` is 2, which is a known explicit value.
* `v1` is again either 0 or n-1, same as the first occurrence.
* `prev` is 1 if `r` is '>' or '=' otherwise 0. Since `r` is an empty string, `prev` is 0.

Putting it all together, the print statement will output a string with the following values:

Output: **? [either 0 or n-1] 2 [either 0 or n-1] 0**

Note that the exact value of `v1` is not specified, so we describe it as "either 0 or n-1" to reflect the uncertainty.
