The code prints a formatted string containing a question mark and the values of `v1` and `v2`. The value of `v1` is either 0 or 1, and the value of `v2` is 2. The string is printed with the question mark followed by two occurrences of `v1` and two occurrences of `v2`.

Output: **? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2] (where v1 is either 0 or 1, and v2 is 2)**
