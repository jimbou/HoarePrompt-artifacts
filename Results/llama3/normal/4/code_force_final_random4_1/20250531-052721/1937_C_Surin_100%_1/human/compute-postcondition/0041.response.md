Postcondition: ***The program executes with the given preconditions and maintains the initial values of `I`, `R`, `n`, `g`, `kp`, `v1`, `v2`, `i`, and `r`. If `r` is '=', then the program checks the value of `r2`. If `r2` is '<', then `prev` is updated to 1, and the output ? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev] is printed for each iteration with `v1` as `n-1`, `i` as 1, and `prev` as 1. If `r2` is not '<', then the program does not update `prev` and does not print the output. In both cases, the output ? 1 1 0 0 is printed initially. If `r` is not '=', the program does not execute the if block and maintains the initial state.***
