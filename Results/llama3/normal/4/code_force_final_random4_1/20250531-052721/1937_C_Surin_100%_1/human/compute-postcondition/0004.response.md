Output State: **I is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into a list of integers, and returns the list, R is a lambda function that reads a single integer from stdin and returns it, n is an integer that must be at least 2, g is 0, v1 is 0, kp is 0, v2 is 1, i is 1, stdin contains at least 1 less integer than initially.**

In this output state, the value of v2 has been updated to 1, which is the current value of i. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains at least 1 less integer than initially.
