The code prints a formatted string indicating the values of `prev` and `v1`. 

The value of `prev` is `n-1` if the input `r` is '>' or '=' and `r2` is '<', `n-1` if the input `r` is '<' and `r2` is not '<', and `n-2` if the input `r` is '>' and `r2` is '<'. 

The value of `v1` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or `n-2` if the input `r` is '>', `n-1` if the input `r` is '<', and either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or `n-1` if the input `r` is '='.

Output: **! [prev] [v1] (where prev is n-1 if r is '>' or '=' and r2 is '<', n-1 if r is '<' and r2 is not '<', and n-2 if r is '>' and r2 is '<', and v1 is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or n-2 if r is '>', n-1 if r is '<', and either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or n-1 if r is '=')**
