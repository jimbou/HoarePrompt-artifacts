Output State: **`I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into a list of integers, and returns the list, `R` is a lambda function that reads a single integer from stdin and returns it, `n` is an integer, `g` is 0, `kp` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `prev` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 less integer than initially, `r` is a string containing a single character that is either '<' or not '<', and the output ? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2] is printed for each iteration.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `prev` that is initialized to 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin and output conditions are still valid.
