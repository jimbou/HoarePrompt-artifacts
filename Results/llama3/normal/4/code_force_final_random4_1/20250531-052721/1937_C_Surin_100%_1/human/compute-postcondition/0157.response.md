Output State: **The output buffer has been flushed again, `kp` is `n+1`, `n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `I` and `R` remain in their initial state, `g` is 0, `v2` is 2, `i` is 2, `r2` remains assigned the original value of the input, and this is printed: "? 0 0 1 1" followed by an empty line. `v1` is 2, and this is printed: "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" where v1 is 2 and v2 is 2, `r` is an empty string**

In this output state, the value of `v1` has been updated to 2, which is the value of `v2`. The other variables remain unchanged. The output buffer has been flushed again, and the same text is printed as before, but with the updated value of `v1`.
