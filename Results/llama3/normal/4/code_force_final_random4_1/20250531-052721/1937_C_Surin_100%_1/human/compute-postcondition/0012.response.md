Output State: **`I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into a list of integers, and returns the list, `R` is a lambda function that reads a single integer from stdin and returns it, `n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `g` is 0, `kp` is 0, `v1` is either 0 or 1, `v2` is 2, `i` is 2, `stdin` contains at least 1 less integer than initially, `r` is either '<' or not '<', and the output ? 0 0 1 1 is printed.**

In this output state, the value of `v2` has been updated to be equal to the value of `i`, which is 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `v1` is still dependent on the value of `r`, which is either '<' or not '<'. The output ? 0 0 1 1 is still printed.
