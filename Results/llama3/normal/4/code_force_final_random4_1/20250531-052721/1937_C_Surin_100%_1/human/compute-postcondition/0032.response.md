Output State: **`I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into a list of integers, and returns the list, `R` is a lambda function that reads a single integer from stdin and returns it, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `kp` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, `i` is 1, `prev` is 1, stdin contains at least 1 less integer than initially, the current value of `r` is '>', and the output ? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev] is printed for each iteration, where `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is 1 and `prev` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state, except for the variable `prev`, which is now assigned the value of `i`, which is 1. The output is still printed for each iteration with the updated value of `prev`.
