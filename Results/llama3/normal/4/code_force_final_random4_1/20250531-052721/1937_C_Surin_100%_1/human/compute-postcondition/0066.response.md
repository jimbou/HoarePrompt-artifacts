Postcondition: **The program's state after the if-else block is as follows: `r` is a string containing the user's response to the printed message, `prev` is 2 if `r` is '>' or '<', otherwise it remains in its initial state, `I`, `R`, `n`, `g`, `kp`, `v1`, `v2` are in their initial states, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and if `r` is '=', `r2` is a string containing the user's response to the input prompt and stdin contains no input, otherwise the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
