To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 2, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to but does not include `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1. The variable `i` will start at 1 because that's where the range begins.

State: **`I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into a list of integers, and returns the list, `R` is a lambda function that reads a single integer from stdin and returns it, `n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `kp` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, `i` is 1, `prev` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 less integer than initially, `r` is a string containing a single character that is either '<' or not '<', and the output ? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2] is printed for each iteration.**
