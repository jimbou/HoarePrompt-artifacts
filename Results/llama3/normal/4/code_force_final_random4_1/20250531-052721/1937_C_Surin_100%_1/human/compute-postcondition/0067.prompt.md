Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into a list of integers, and returns the list, `R` is a lambda function that reads a single integer from stdin and returns it, `n` is an integer, `g` is 0, `kp` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `prev` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 less integer than initially, `r` is a string containing a single character that is either '<' or not '<', and the output ? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2] is printed for each iteration.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
    sys.stdout.flush()
    r = input()
    if r == '>':
        prev = i
    elif r == '=':
        print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
        sys.stdout.flush()
        r2 = input('')
        if r2 == '<':
            prev = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The program executes with the given preconditions and maintains the initial values of `I`, `R`, `n`, `g`, `kp`, `v1`, `v2`, `i`, and `r`. If `r` is '>', then `prev` is updated to 1 and the output ? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev] is printed for each iteration with `v1` as `n-1`, `i` as 1, and `prev` as 1. If `r` is '=', then the program checks the value of `r2`. If `r2` is '<', then `prev` is updated to 1, and the output ? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev] is printed for each iteration with `v1` as `n-1`, `i` as 1, and `prev` as 1. If `r2` is not '<', then the program does not update `prev` and does not print the output. In both cases, the output ? 1 1 0 0 is printed initially. If `r` is not '=' or '>', the program does not execute the if block and maintains the initial state.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The program has processed the input `r` and updated the state of the variables accordingly. If `r` is '>', the previous value `prev` is set to 2. If `r` is '=', the output "? 2 2 [prev] [prev]" is printed, the output buffer is flushed, and a new input `r2` is received. If `r2` is '<', then `prev` is set to 2; otherwise, `prev` remains initial. If `r` is neither '>' nor '=', no additional actions are taken. In all cases, the output "? [v1] 2 [v1] [prev]" has been printed to the console, and the variables `I`, `R`, `n`, `g`, `kp`, `v1`, `v2`, and `i` remain in their initial state.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The program's state after the if-else block is as follows: `r` is a string containing the user's response to the printed message, `prev` is 2 if `r` is '>' or '<', otherwise it remains in its initial state, `I`, `R`, `n`, `g`, `kp`, `v1`, `v2` are in their initial states, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and if `r` is '=', `r2` is a string containing the user's response to the input prompt and stdin contains no input, otherwise the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
