Output State: **The output buffer has been flushed again. The variable `kp` remains `n`, and `n` is an integer. The variables `I` and `R` remain in their initial state, and `g` is 0. The variable `v2` is `n-1`, and `i` is `n-1`. If the input `r` is '>', then `v1` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or `n-2`, and `prev` is `n-1`. If the input `r` is '=', then `v1` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or `n-1`, and `prev` is `n-1` if `r2` is '<' and `n-2` otherwise. If the input `r` is '<', then `v1` is `n-1`, and `prev` is `n-1` if `r2` is not '<' and `n-1` if `r2` is '<'. The variable `r` has been assigned the value of the input. If the input `r` is '<', then the following is also printed: "? [n-1] [n-1] [prev] [prev]" where prev is `n-2` if the input `r` is '>' and `r2` is '<', `n-1` if the input `r` is '>' or '=' and `r2` is '<', and 0 if the input `r` is '<' and `r2` is not '<'. The variable `r2` has been assigned the value of the input. The following is printed: "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or `n-2` if the input `r` is '>', or `n-1` if the input `r` is '<', and `i` is `n-1`, and `prev` is `n-1` if the input `r` is '>' or '=' and `r2` is '<', and `n-1` if the input `r` is '<' and `r2` is not '<'. If `r` is '=', then the following is also printed: "? [i] [i] [prev] [prev]" where `i` is `n-1`, and `prev` is `n-2` if the input `r` is '>' or '=' and `r2` is '<', and 0 if the input `r` is '<' and `r2` is not '<'. The following is printed: "! [prev] [v1]" where `prev` is `n-1` if the input `r` is '>' or '=' and `r2` is '<', and `n-1` if the input `r` is '<' and `r2` is not '<', and `v1` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or `n-2` if the input `r` is '>', or `n-1` if the input `r` is '<'.**
