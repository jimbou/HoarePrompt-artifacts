Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `x` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, stdin contains no more test cases. If there exists an index `j` in the range `[0, x)` such that `l[l[j] - 1]` equals `j + 1` for any iteration of the loop, then `flag` is True and the number 2 is printed for that iteration. Otherwise, the number 3 is printed for that iteration.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the loop counter `i` will be equal to the initial value of `n`, which is between 2 and 50 inclusive. The variable `x` will still be an integer, and `l` will still be a list of integers. The standard input `stdin` will be empty, as all test cases would have been processed. The value of `flag` and the output (either 2 or 3) will depend on the condition being met for any iteration of the loop.
