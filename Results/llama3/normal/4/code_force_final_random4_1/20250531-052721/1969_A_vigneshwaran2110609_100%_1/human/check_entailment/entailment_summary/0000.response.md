Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The problem requires finding the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send so that at least 2 friends come to the party.
2. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of an integer n followed by n distinct integers.
3. The program then checks for each test case if there exists an index j such that the jth integer is equal to the index of the jth integer plus one. This is done using the condition `if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1`.
4. If such an index exists, it means that the jth friend and their best friend (at index j+1) can both be invited, resulting in at least 2 friends coming to the party. In this case, the program prints 2.
5. If no such index exists, it means that at least 3 friends need to be invited to ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party. In this case, the program prints 3.
6. The program correctly handles all test cases and prints the minimum number of invitations required for each case.

Correctness: **True**
