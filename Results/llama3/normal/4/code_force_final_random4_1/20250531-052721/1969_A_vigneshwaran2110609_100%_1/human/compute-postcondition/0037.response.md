Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `x + 1`, `x` is an integer that must be greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is 1. If the value at index `l[i] - 1` in list `l` is equal to `i + 1`, then `flag` is set to True, the number 2 is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
