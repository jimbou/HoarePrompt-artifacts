Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to have at least 2 friends come to the party.

The program iterates over each test case, and for each test case, it checks if there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends (i.e., `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1`). If such a pair is found, it prints 2, indicating that Monocarp only needs to send invitations to these two friends. If no such pair is found, it prints 3, indicating that Monocarp needs to send invitations to at least three friends.

The program correctly handles the edge case where `n` is 2, in which case it will always find a pair of friends who are each other's best friends and print 2.

The program also correctly handles the case where `n` is greater than 2, in which case it will either find a pair of friends who are each other's best friends and print 2, or it will not find such a pair and print 3.

Therefore, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
