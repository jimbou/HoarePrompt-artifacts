Output State: **`n` is greater than `x + 1`, `x` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is `x`, `flag` is True.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `x`, and the `flag` variable will be set to True. The values of `n` and `l` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop.
