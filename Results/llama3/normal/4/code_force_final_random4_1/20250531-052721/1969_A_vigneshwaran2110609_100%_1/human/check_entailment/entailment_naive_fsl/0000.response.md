Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input is:

3
4
2 3 4 1

The program will print 3, but the correct answer is 3. However, if the input is:

3
6
2 3 4 5 6 1

The program will print 3, but the correct answer is 4. The program does not correctly handle cases where there are more than two pairs of friends that can attend the party.

The program only checks if there is at least one pair of friends that can attend the party, and if so, it prints 2. If not, it prints 3. However, this is not sufficient to solve the problem, as there can be cases where more than two pairs of friends can attend the party, and the program should print the minimum number of invitations needed to invite at least two pairs of friends.

A correct solution would need to check all possible pairs of friends and find the minimum number of invitations needed to invite at least two pairs of friends.
