According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `x` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is greater than `x + 1` does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `x` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.
State: **`n` is greater than `x + 1`, `i` is 0, `x` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, stdin is empty**
