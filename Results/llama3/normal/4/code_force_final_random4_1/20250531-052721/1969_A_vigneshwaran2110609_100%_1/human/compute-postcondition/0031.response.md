Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `x + 1`, `x` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is 0. If the value at index `l[i] - 1` in list `l` is equal to `i + 1`, then `flag` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
