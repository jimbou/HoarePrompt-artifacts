Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `x` + 1, `x` is an integer and at least 2, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `flag` is True. If `l[l[i] - 1]` is equal to `i + 1`, then the number 2 has been printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
