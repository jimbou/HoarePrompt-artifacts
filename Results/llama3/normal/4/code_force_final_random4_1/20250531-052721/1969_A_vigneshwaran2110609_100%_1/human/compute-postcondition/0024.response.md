Output State: **n is greater than x + 1, i is x + 1, x is an integer, l is a list of integers, stdin is empty**

The code block consists of two lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `x`. Since `x` was previously an integer, its value is updated to the input value. The second line assigns a list of integers from the input to `l`. Since `l` was previously a list of integers, its value is updated to the input list.

The value of `n` is not modified by the code, so it remains greater than `x + 1`. The value of `i` is also not modified, so it remains `x + 1`.

The stdin is empty after the code execution because two inputs are consumed by the code.

In summary, the code updates the values of `x` and `l`, and consumes two inputs from stdin, leaving it empty. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
