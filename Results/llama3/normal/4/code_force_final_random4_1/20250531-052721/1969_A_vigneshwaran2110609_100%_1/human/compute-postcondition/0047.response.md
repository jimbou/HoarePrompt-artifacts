To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `x`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `x` is at least 1. Since `i` is initialized to `x + 1` before the loop, we need to adjust `i` to be 0, which is the starting value of the range. We also need to adjust `x` to be at least 1.

State: **`n` is greater than `x` + 1, `x` is an integer and at least 1, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is 0, `flag` is True**
