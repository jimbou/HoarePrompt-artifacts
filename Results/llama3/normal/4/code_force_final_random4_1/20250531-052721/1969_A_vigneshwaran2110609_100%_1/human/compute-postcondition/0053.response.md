Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `x` + 1, `x` is an integer and at least 1, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is 0, `flag` is True. If the current value of `l[l[i] - 1]` is equal to `i + 1`, then the number 2 is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
