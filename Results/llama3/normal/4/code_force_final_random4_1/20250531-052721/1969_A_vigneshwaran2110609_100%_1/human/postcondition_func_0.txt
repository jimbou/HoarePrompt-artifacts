This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n distinct integers. It checks for each test case if there exists an index j such that the jth integer is equal to the index of the jth integer plus one. If such an index exists, it prints 2; otherwise, it prints 3. The function processes all test cases and then terminates, leaving the standard input empty.
