The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `x`, `n` is greater than `x + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is `x + 1` and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than `x + 1`.
State: **`n` is greater than `x + 1`, `x` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is `x + 1`, `flag` is True**
