To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`. The loop will execute if `x` is greater than 0. Since `i` is already 0, we don't need to adjust it. However, we need to ensure that `x` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x` is at least 1, `l` is a list of integers, stdin contains the rest of the test cases.**
