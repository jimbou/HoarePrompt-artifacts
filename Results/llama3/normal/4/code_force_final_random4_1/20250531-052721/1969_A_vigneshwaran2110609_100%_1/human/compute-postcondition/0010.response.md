To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `x`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `x` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `x` remains the same, but since `i` is now 1, `x` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x` is greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, stdin contains the rest of the test cases.**
