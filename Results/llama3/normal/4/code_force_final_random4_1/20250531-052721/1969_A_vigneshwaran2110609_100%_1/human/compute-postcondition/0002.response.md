Output State: **n is greater than 0, i is 0, x is an integer, l is a list of integers, stdin contains the rest of the test cases.**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `x`. The second line assigns a list of integers from stdin to `l`. Stdin is now empty so we don't include it in the output state. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
