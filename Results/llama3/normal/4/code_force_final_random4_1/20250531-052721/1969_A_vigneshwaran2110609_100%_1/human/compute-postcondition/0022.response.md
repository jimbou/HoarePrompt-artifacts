Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `x`, `x` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, stdin contains the rest of the test cases. If there exists an index `j` in the range `[0, x)` such that `l[l[j] - 1]` equals `j + 1`, then `flag` is True and the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, the number 3 is printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `x`, and the value of `x` remains unchanged. The list `l` and the variable `n` also remain unchanged. If at any point during the loop's execution, the condition `l[l[j] - 1] == j + 1` was true for some index `j`, then `flag` will be True and the number 2 will be printed. Otherwise, the number 3 will be printed.
