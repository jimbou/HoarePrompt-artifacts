Output State: **cnt is 0, a is a list of 4 integers, x is the last integer in the list a, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200)**

The code first reads a line of four integers from stdin and assigns them to the list `a`. This reduces the number of lines in stdin by 1. The second line initializes the variable `cnt` to 0. The initial state's information about `cnt` being increased by the integer part of each integer in the list `a` divided by 2 is no longer valid, as `cnt` is reset to 0. The value of `x` is still the last integer in the list `a`, but the specific value of `x` is not provided.
