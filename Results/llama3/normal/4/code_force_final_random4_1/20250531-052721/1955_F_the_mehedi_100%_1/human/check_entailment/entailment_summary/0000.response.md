Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. For each test case, it reads four integers representing the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence.
2. It checks if all four integers have the same parity (i.e., all odd or all even). If they do, it increments the count by 1. This is because if all integers have the same parity, the XOR of all numbers will be non-zero, and Alice will win. By removing one number, Eve can make the XOR zero, allowing Bob to win.
3. For each integer in the input, it calculates the integer division by 2 and adds it to the count. This is because each integer can be paired with another integer of the same value to make the XOR zero. By removing one integer from each pair, Eve can make the XOR zero, allowing Bob to win.

The program correctly implements this logic and produces the expected output for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
