Output State: **stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), a is a list of 5 integers, cnt is 0**

The first line reads an integer t from stdin and assigns it to a list along with four other integers. Since t is between 1 and 10^4, the list a will contain 5 integers. The second line initializes the variable cnt to 0. No other variables are affected.
