Postcondition: ***cnt is either 0 or 1, a is a list of 4 integers, x is the last integer in the list a, stdin contains t-1 or t-2 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200). If all the first three integers in the list a are odd, then cnt is 1 and stdin contains t-2 lines. Otherwise, cnt remains 0 and stdin contains t-1 lines.***
