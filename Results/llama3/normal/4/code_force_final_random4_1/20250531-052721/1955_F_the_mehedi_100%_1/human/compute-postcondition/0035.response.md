The only objects in the loop head are variables  x and list  a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list a.  If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, a has at least 2 elements, x is the second integer in the list a. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the x is the third integer in the list a.
State: **`cnt` is either 0 or 1 plus the integer division of the third integer in the list `a` by 2, plus the integer division of the third integer in the list `a` by 2, `a` is a list of four integers that must have at least three elements, `x` is the third integer in the list `a`, stdin contains t-3 or t-4 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200)**
