Output State: **`cnt` is either 0 or 1 plus the integer division of the first integer in the list `a` by 2, `a` is a list of four integers that must have at least one element, `x` is the first integer in the list `a`, stdin contains t-3 or t-4 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200)**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been updated by adding the integer division of the first integer in the list `a` by 2. The list `a` and the variable `x` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-3 or t-4 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200).
