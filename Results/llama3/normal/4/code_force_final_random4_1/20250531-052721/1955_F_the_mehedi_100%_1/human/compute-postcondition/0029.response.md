Output State: **cnt is 1, a is a list of four integers, x is the last integer in the list a, stdin contains t-4 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200)**

In this output state, the value of cnt has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The list a and the variable x remain unchanged, as they were not affected by the code. The stdin still contains t-4 lines, each containing four integers p_i, as the code did not read or modify the input.
