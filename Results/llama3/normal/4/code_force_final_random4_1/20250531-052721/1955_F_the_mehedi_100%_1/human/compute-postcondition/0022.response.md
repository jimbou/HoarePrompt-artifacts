To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `x` and `a`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `a` has at least 3 integers. At the end of the last iteration, `a` has at least 2 integers, and `x` is the second integer in the list `a`. For the loop to execute again, `a` must have at least 3 integers, and `x` must be the third integer in the list `a`.

Additionally, `cnt` has been incremented by the integer part of `x` divided by 2, but this does not affect the loop head.

State: **`cnt` is either 0, 1, or more, depending on the value of `x`, `a` is a list of 4 integers that must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in the list `a`, stdin contains t-1 or t-2 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200)**
