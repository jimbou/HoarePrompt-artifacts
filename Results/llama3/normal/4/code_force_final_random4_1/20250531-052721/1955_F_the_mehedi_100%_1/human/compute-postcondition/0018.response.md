According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list has at least 1 integer the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, cnt is either 0 or 1, a is a list of 4 integers, x is the last integer in the list a, stdin contains t-1 or t-2 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200). If all the first three integers in the list a are odd, then cnt is 1 and stdin contains t-2 lines. Otherwise, cnt remains 0 and stdin contains t-1 lines. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 integer and the x is the first integer in the list.
State: **`cnt` is either 0 or 1, a is a list of 4 integers that must have at least 1 integer, x is the first integer in the list a, stdin contains t-1 or t-2 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200)**
