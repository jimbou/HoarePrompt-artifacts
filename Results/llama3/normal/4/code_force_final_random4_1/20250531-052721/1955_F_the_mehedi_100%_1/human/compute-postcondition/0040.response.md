Output State: **cnt is either 0 or 1 plus the integer division of the first integer in the list a by 2, plus the integer division of the second integer in the list a by 2, plus the integer division of the third integer in the list a by 2, plus the integer division of the fourth integer in the list a by 2, a is an empty list, x is the fourth integer in the list a, stdin contains 0 lines, and cnt is printed**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of cnt will be the sum of the integer divisions of each integer in the list a by 2, plus 1 if the first three integers in the list a are all odd. The list a will be empty, and the variable x will hold the value of the last integer in the list a. The stdin will be empty, as all input lines have been processed. The final value of cnt will be printed.
