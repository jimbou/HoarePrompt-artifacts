The only variable in the loop head is variable  x and list a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list a.  If the list has at least 3 integers the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, a has at least 2 integers, x is the second integer in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 integers and the x is the third integer in the list.
State: **`cnt` is increased by the integer part of the second integer in the list `a` divided by 2, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), `a` is a list of at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in the list `a`**
