The only variables in the loop head are variables  _ and stdin, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than the integer part of the input, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is t-1, stdin contains t-1 lines. So for the loop to be executed one more time the stdin must contain t lines and _ is t.
State: **`cnt` is increased by the integer part of each integer in the list a divided by 2, stdin contains t lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), a is a list of 5 integers, x is the last integer in the list a, and the value of cnt is being printed**
