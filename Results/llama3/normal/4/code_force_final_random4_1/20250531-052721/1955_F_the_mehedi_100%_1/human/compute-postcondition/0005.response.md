To ensure the loop executes, we need to consider the state of the variable `a`, as it is the only object in the loop head. The loop will execute if `a` has at least one element.

State: **stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), a is a list of at least 1 integer, x is the first integer in the list a**
