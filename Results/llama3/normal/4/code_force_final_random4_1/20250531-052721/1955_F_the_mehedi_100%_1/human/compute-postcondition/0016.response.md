Output State: **`cnt` is 1, `a` is a list of 4 integers, `x` is the last integer in the list `a`, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200)**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The list `a` and the value of `x` (which is the last integer in the list `a`) remain unchanged. The stdin now contains t-2 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), since one line has been processed.
