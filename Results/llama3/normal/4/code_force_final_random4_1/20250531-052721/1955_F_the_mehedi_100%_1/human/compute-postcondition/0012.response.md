The code prints the value of `cnt`, which is increased by the integer part of each integer in the list `a` divided by 2.

Since `a` is a list of 5 integers, the value of `cnt` will be the sum of the integer parts of each integer in `a` divided by 2.

Let's denote the integers in `a` as `a[0]`, `a[1]`, `a[2]`, `a[3]`, and `a[4]`. The value of `cnt` will be:

`cnt = (a[0] // 2) + (a[1] // 2) + (a[2] // 2) + (a[3] // 2) + (a[4] // 2)`

where `//` denotes integer division.

Since `x` is the last integer in the list `a`, we can also write:

`cnt = (a[0] // 2) + (a[1] // 2) + (a[2] // 2) + (a[3] // 2) + (x // 2)`

The value of `cnt` will be an integer, as it is the sum of integer parts of divisions.

Output: **cnt (where cnt is the sum of the integer parts of each integer in the list a divided by 2)**
