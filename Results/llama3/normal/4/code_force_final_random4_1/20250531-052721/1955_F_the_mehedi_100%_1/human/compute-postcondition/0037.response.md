Output State: **cnt is either 0 or 1 plus the integer division of the first integer in the list a by 2, plus the integer division of the second integer in the list a by 2, plus the integer division of the third integer in the list a by 2, plus the integer division of the fourth integer in the list a by 2, a is an empty list, x is the fourth integer in the list a, stdin contains t-3 or t-4 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200)**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `cnt` will be the sum of the integer divisions of all four integers in the list `a` by 2, plus 0 or 1 depending on the initial value of `cnt`. The list `a` will be empty, and `x` will be the last integer in the original list `a`. The state of `stdin` remains unchanged.
