Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = 0
    if a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1:
        cnt += 1
    for x in a:
        cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
    print(cnt)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: cnt is increased by the integer part of each integer in the list a divided by 2, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), a is a list of 5 integers, x is the last integer in the list a, and the value of cnt is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: cnt is either 0, 1, or more, depending on the value of x, a is an empty list, x is the last integer in the list a, stdin contains t-1 or t-2 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), and cnt has been incremented by the integer part of each integer in the list a divided by 2, and the value of cnt is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: cnt is either 0 or 1 plus the integer division of the first integer in the list a by 2, plus the integer division of the second integer in the list a by 2, plus the integer division of the third integer in the list a by 2, plus the integer division of the fourth integer in the list a by 2, a is an empty list, x is the fourth integer in the list a, stdin contains t-3 or t-4 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), and cnt is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
