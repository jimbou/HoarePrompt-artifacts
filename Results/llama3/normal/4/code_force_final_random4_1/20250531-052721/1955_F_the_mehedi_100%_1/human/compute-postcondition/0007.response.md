The only variable in the loop head is variable  x and list a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list a.  If the list has at least 2 integers the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, a is a list of at least 1 integer, x is the first integer in the list a. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 integers and the x is the second integer in the list.
State: **`cnt` is increased by the integer part of `x` divided by 2, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), a is a list of at least 2 integers, x is the second integer in the list a**
