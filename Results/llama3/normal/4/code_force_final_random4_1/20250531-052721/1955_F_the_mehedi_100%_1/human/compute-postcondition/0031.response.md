To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `x` and `a`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `a` has at least one element. Since `a` is a list of four integers, we can adjust its state to ensure it has at least one element.

We can also adjust the state of `x` to be the first integer in the list `a`, since the loop will start with the first element of `a`.

The other variables `cnt`, `stdin`, and `t` are not in the loop head, so we cannot adjust their states.

State: **`cnt` is either 0 or 1, `a` is a list of four integers that must have at least one element, `x` is the first integer in the list `a`, stdin contains t-3 or t-4 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200)**
