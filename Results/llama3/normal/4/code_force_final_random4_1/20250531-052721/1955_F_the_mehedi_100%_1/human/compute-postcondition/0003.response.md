Output State: **`cnt` is 1, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), a is a list of 5 integers, and the current values of a[0], a[1], and a[2] are odd.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables and stdin remain unchanged. The list `a` still contains 5 integers, and the current values of `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]` are still odd. The stdin still contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200).
