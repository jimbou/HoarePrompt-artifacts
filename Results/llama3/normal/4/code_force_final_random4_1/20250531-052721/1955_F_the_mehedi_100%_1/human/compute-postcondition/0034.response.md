Output State: **`cnt` is either 0 or 1 plus the integer division of the second integer in the list `a` by 2, plus the integer division of the second integer in the list `a` by 2, `a` is a list of four integers that must have at least two elements, `x` is the second integer in the list `a`, stdin contains t-3 or t-4 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200)**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt` has been increased by the integer division of the second integer in the list `a` by 2. The list `a` and the value of `x` remain unchanged. The number of lines in the standard input also remains the same.
