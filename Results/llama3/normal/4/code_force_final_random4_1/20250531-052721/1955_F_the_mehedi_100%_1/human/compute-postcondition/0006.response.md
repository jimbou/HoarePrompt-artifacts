Output State: **`cnt` is increased by the integer part of `x` divided by 2, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), a is a list of at least 1 integer, x is the first integer in the list a**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been updated by adding the integer part of `x` divided by 2. The other variables and stdin remain unchanged. The list `a` still contains at least one integer, and `x` is still the first integer in the list `a`. The stdin still contains t-1 lines, each with four integers p_i between 0 and 200.
