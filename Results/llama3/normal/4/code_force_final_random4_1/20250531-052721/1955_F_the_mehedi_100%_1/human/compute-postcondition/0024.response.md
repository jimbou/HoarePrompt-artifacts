Output State: **cnt is either 0, 1, or more, depending on the value of x, a is an empty list, x is the last integer in the list a, stdin contains t-1 or t-2 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), and cnt has been incremented by the integer part of each integer in the list a divided by 2.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable cnt has been incremented by the integer part of each integer in the list a divided by 2, the list a is now empty, and the variable x is the last integer in the list a. The state of the other variables, including stdin, remains unchanged.
