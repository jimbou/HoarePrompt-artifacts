Postcondition: ***cnt is either 0 or 1, a is a list of four integers, x is the last integer in the list a, stdin contains t-3 or t-4 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200). If all the first three integers in the list a are odd, then cnt is 1 and stdin contains t-4 lines. Otherwise, cnt is 0 and stdin contains t-3 lines.***
