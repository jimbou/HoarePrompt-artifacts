Output State: **cnt is increased by the integer part of each integer in the list a divided by 2, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), a is a list of 5 integers, x is the last integer in the list a**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable cnt has been increased by the integer part of each integer in the list a divided by 2. The stdin remains unchanged, containing t-1 lines, each with four integers p_i ranging from 0 to 200. The list a still contains 5 integers, and the variable x now holds the value of the last integer in the list a.
