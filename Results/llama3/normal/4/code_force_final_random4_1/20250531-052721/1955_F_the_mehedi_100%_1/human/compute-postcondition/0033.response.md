To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `x` and `a`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is the first integer in the list `a`, and `a` is a list of four integers that must have at least one element. For the loop to execute again, `a` must have at least two elements, and `x` must be the second integer in the list `a`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`cnt` is either 0 or 1 plus the integer division of the second integer in the list `a` by 2, `a` is a list of four integers that must have at least two elements, `x` is the second integer in the list `a`, stdin contains t-3 or t-4 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200)**
