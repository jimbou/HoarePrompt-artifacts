Output State: **`cnt` is either the integer division of the third integer in the list `a` by 2, plus the integer division of the third integer in the list `a` by 2, plus the integer division of the third integer in the list `a` by 2, `a` is a list of four integers that must have at least three elements, `x` is the third integer in the list `a`, stdin contains t-3 or t-4 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200)**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt` is increased by the integer division of the third integer in the list `a` by 2. The list `a` and the value of `x` remain the same. The stdin still contains t-3 or t-4 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200).
