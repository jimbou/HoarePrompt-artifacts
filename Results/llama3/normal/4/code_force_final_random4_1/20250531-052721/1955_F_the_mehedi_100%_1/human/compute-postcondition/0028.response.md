Output State: **cnt is 0, a is a list of four integers, x is the last integer in the list a, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200)**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns a list of four integers from stdin to `a`. Since stdin contains t-2 or t-3 lines, each containing four integers, `a` becomes a list of four integers. The second line resets `cnt` to 0, overriding its previous value. The value of `x` is still the last integer in the list `a`. The state of stdin is updated to contain t-3 lines, each containing four integers.
