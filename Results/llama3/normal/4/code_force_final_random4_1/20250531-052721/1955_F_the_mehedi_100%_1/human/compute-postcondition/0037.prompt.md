Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *cnt is either 0 or 1, a is a list of four integers, x is the last integer in the list a, stdin contains t-3 or t-4 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200). If all the first three integers in the list a are odd, then cnt is 1 and stdin contains t-4 lines. Otherwise, cnt is 0 and stdin contains t-3 lines.
Code of the loop:
for x in a:
    cnt += math.floor(x / 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cnt` is either 0 or 1 plus the integer division of the first integer in the list `a` by 2, `a` is a list of four integers that must have at least one element, `x` is the first integer in the list `a`, stdin contains t-3 or t-4 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200)

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cnt` is either 0 or 1 plus the integer division of the second integer in the list `a` by 2, plus the integer division of the second integer in the list `a` by 2, `a` is a list of four integers that must have at least two elements, `x` is the second integer in the list `a`, stdin contains t-3 or t-4 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200)

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cnt` is either the integer division of the third integer in the list `a` by 2, plus the integer division of the third integer in the list `a` by 2, plus the integer division of the third integer in the list `a` by 2, `a` is a list of four integers that must have at least three elements, `x` is the third integer in the list `a`, stdin contains t-3 or t-4 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200)




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
