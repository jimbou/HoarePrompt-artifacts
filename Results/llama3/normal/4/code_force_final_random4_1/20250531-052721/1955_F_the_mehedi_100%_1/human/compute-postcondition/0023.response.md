Output State: **`cnt` is either 0, 1, or more, depending on the value of `x`, `a` is a list of 4 integers that must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in the list `a`, stdin contains t-1 or t-2 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), and `cnt` has been incremented by the integer part of `x` divided by 2.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been updated by adding the integer part of `x` divided by 2, which means it has been incremented by the largest integer less than or equal to `x/2`. The values of `a` and `x` remain the same, and the contents of stdin are unchanged.
