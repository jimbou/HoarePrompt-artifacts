Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where at least the last `end` elements are equal, `le` is equal to `n`, `l` is less than `r`, `r` is greater than `l - 1`, `st` is equal to the number of equal elements at the start of the list, `end` is equal to the number of equal elements at the end of the list, `ans` is equal to `n - max(st, end)`, stdin contains `t - 1` test cases. The first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`.***
