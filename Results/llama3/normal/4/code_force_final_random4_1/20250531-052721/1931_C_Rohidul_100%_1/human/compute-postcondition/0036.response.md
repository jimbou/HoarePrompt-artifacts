Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, a is a list of n integers, le is equal to n, l is equal to r - 3, st is equal to l + 1, end is 4, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers, r is at least l + 2, and a[r] is equal to a[r-1], a[r-2], and a[r-3].**

In this final state, the value of `r` has been decremented by 1, and the value of `end` has been incremented by 1. The relationship between `l` and `r` has been updated to `l` is equal to `r - 3` to reflect the change in `r`. All other variables remain unchanged.
