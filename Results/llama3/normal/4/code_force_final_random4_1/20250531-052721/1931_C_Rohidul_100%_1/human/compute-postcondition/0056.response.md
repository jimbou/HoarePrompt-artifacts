Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, a is a list of n integers where the last two elements are equal, le is equal to n, l is less than n - 1, r is equal to n - 3, st is equal to the number of consecutive equal elements at the beginning of a, end is equal to 3, and the value of ans is being printed.**

The code modifies the values of `r` and `end`. The first line decrements `r` by 1, making it equal to `n - 3`. The second line increments `end` by 1, making it equal to 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
