Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers where at least the last two elements are equal, le is equal to n, l is less than n - 1, r is n - 2, st is equal to the number of equal elements at the start of the list, end is 2, stdin contains t - 1 test cases**

The code snippet modifies the values of `r` and `end`. The first line decrements `r` by 1, changing its value from `n - 1` to `n - 2`. The second line increments `end` by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
