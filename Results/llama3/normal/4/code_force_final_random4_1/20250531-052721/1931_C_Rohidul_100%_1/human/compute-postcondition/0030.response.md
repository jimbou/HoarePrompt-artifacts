Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, a is a list of n integers, le is equal to n, l is equal to r, st is equal to l + 1, end is 1, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers.**

This output state means that after the loop finishes executing, the value of `l` will be equal to `r`, and the value of `st` will be one more than the value of `l`. The values of `n`, `le`, `end`, and the contents of `stdin` remain unchanged. The list `a` can contain any integers, but the loop will have iterated until it found a pair of adjacent elements that are not equal, or until `l` reached the value of `r`.
