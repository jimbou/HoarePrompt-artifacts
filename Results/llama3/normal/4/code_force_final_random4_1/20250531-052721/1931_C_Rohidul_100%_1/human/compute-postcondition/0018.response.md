Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where at least the last `end` elements are equal, `le` is equal to `n`, `l` is less than `r`, `r` is greater than `l - 1`, `st` is equal to the number of equal elements at the start of the list, `end` is equal to the number of equal elements at the end of the list, `ans` is equal to `max(0, n - (st + end))`, stdin contains `t - 1` test cases. The first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to `max(0, le - (st + end))`, which is equivalent to `max(0, n - (st + end))` since `le` is equal to `n`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a` is still valid.
