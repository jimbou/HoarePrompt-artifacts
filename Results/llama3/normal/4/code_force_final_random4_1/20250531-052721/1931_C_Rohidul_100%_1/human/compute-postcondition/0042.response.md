The `print(ans)` statement will print the calculated value of `ans`, which depends on the conditions specified in the initial state.

If the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, then `ans` is equal to `max(0, le - (l + 1 + end))`. Here, `le` is equal to `n`, `l` is equal to `r`, and `end` is equal to the number of consecutive equal elements at the end of the list `a`. Since `l` is equal to `r`, we can simplify this expression to `max(0, n - (r + 1 + end))`.

On the other hand, if the first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a`, then `ans` is equal to `le - max(l + 1, end)`. Again, since `le` is equal to `n` and `l` is equal to `r`, we can simplify this expression to `n - max(r + 1, end)`.

In both cases, the value of `ans` depends on the values of `n`, `r`, and `end`, which are not explicitly provided in the initial state. However, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **n - max(r + 1, end) if the first element of a is not equal to the last element of a, otherwise max(0, n - (r + 1 + end)) (where n is the number of elements in the list a, r is equal to l, and end is the number of consecutive equal elements at the end of the list a)**
