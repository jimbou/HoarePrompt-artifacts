Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `le` is equal to `n`, `l` is equal to `r`, `st` is equal to `l + 1`, `end` is equal to the number of consecutive equal elements at the end of the list `a`, `ans` is equal to `le - max(l + 1, end)`, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` is calculated as the difference between `le` (which is equal to `n`) and the maximum of `st` (which is equal to `l + 1`) and `end` (which is equal to the number of consecutive equal elements at the end of the list `a`). The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin is now empty since it has been used to input the list of integers.
