Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    le = len(a)
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    st, end = 1, 1
    while l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]:
        l += 1
        st += 1
    while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
        r -= 1
        end += 1
    ans = le - max(st, end)
    if a[0] == a[-1]:
        ans = max(0, le - (st + end))
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where at least the last `end` elements are equal, `le` is equal to `n`, `l` is less than `r`, `r` is greater than `l - 1`, `st` is equal to the number of equal elements at the start of the list, `end` is equal to the number of equal elements at the end of the list. If the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, then `ans` is equal to `max(0, n - (st + end))`. Otherwise, `ans` is equal to `n - max(st, end)`, and the value of `ans` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `le` is equal to `n`, `l` is equal to `r`, `st` is equal to `l + 1`, `end` is equal to the number of consecutive equal elements at the end of the list `a`, `ans` is equal to `max(0, le - (l + 1 + end))` if the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, otherwise `ans` is equal to `le - max(l + 1, end)`, and the value of `ans` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `le` is equal to `n`, `l` is equal to the index of the first element in `a` that is not equal to the first element in `a`, `r` is equal to the index of the last element in `a` that is equal to the last element in `a`, `st` is equal to the number of consecutive equal elements at the beginning of `a`, `end` is equal to the number of consecutive equal elements at the end of `a`. If the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, then `ans` is equal to `max(0, le - (st + end))`, otherwise `ans` is equal to `le - max(st, end)`, and the value of `ans` is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
