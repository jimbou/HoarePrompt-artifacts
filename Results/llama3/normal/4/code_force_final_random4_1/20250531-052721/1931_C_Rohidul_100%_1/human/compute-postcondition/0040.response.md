Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `le` is equal to `n`, `l` is equal to `r`, `st` is equal to `l + 1`, `end` is equal to the number of consecutive equal elements at the end of the list `a`, `ans` is equal to `max(0, le - (l + 1 + end))`, stdin contains no input. The first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated to the maximum of 0 and the difference between `le` and the sum of `l + 1` and `end`. All other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` still contains `n` integers, and the first element of `a` is still equal to the last element of `a`. The stdin is still empty.
