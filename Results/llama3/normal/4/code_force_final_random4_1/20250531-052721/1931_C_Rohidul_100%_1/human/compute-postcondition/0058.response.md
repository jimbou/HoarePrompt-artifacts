Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, a is a list of n integers where the last four elements are equal, le is equal to n, l is less than n - 4, r is equal to n - 4, st is equal to the number of consecutive equal elements at the beginning of a, end is equal to 4, and the value of ans is being printed**

The code snippet modifies the values of `r` and `end`. The first line decrements `r` by 1, making it equal to `n - 4`. The second line increments `end` by 1, making it equal to 4. Since `a` is a list of `n` integers where the last three elements are equal, and `end` is now equal to 4, the last four elements of `a` are equal. The value of `l` is still less than `n - 3`, but since `r` is now equal to `n - 4`, `l` is also less than `n - 4`. The value of `st` remains the same, as it is not affected by the code. The value of `ans` is still being printed, as it is not modified by the code.
