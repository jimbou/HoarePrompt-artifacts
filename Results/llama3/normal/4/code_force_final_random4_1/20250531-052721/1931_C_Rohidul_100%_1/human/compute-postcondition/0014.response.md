Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers where at least the last four elements are equal, le is equal to n, l is less than r, r is greater than l - 1, st is equal to the number of equal elements at the start of the list, end is 4, stdin contains t - 1 test cases**

In this output state, the value of `r` has been decremented by 1, and the value of `end` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` still contains at least four equal elements at the end, and the relationship between `l` and `r` is still maintained, with `l` being less than `r` and `r` being greater than `l - 1`. The number of test cases in stdin has not been affected.
