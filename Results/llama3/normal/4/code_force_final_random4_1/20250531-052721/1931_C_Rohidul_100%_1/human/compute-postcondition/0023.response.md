Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers, le is equal to n, l is 0, r is n - 1, st is 1, end is 1, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers**

The code first assigns the integer value of the input to `n`, which is an integer greater than 1. Then, it assigns a list of integers from stdin to `a`, making `a` a list of `n` integers. The third line assigns the length of `a` to `le`, making `le` equal to `n`. The fourth line assigns 0 to `l` and `n - 1` to `r`, making `l` less than `r` and `r` greater than `l - 1`. The fifth line assigns 1 to both `st` and `end`, making `st` and `end` equal to 1. The value of `ans` is not affected by the code, so it remains as described in the precondition. Stdin now contains one input: a space-separated list of integers.
