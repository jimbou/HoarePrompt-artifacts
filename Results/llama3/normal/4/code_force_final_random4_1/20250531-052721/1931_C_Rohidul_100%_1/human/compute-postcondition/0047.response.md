Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers where at least the first two elements are equal, le is equal to n, l is equal to 1, r is equal to n - 1, st is equal to 2, end is equal to 1, and the value of ans is being printed.**

The code increments the value of `l` by 1, making it equal to 1, and increments the value of `st` by 1, making it equal to 2. No other variables are affected by the code.
