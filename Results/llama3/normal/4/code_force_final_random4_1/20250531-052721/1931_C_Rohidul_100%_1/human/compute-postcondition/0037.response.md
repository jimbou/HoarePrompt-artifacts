Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, a is a list of n integers, le is equal to n, l is equal to r, st is equal to l + 1, end is equal to the number of consecutive equal elements at the end of the list a, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is such that the variables not affected by the loop head and body (n, a, le, st, stdin) remain unchanged. The variables in the loop head and body (l, r, end) are updated as follows:

- l is equal to r, because the loop continues as long as r is greater than l and a[r] is equal to a[r-1]. When the loop finishes, r is not greater than l, so l must be equal to r.
- end is equal to the number of consecutive equal elements at the end of the list a, because in each iteration of the loop, end is incremented by 1, and the loop continues as long as a[r] is equal to a[r-1]. When the loop finishes, end will be equal to the number of consecutive equal elements at the end of the list a.
