Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers where at least the last three elements are equal, le is equal to n, l is less than n - 1, r is n - 3, st is equal to the number of equal elements at the start of the list, end is 3, stdin contains t - 1 test cases**

The code modifies the values of `r` and `end`. The first line decrements `r` by 1, making it `n - 3`. The second line increments `end` by 1, making it 3. No other variables are affected.
