Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `le` is equal to `n`, `l` is equal to the index of the first element in `a` that is not equal to the first element in `a`, `r` is equal to the index of the last element in `a` that is equal to the last element in `a`, `st` is equal to the number of consecutive equal elements at the beginning of `a`, `end` is equal to the number of consecutive equal elements at the end of `a`, `ans` is equal to `max(0, le - (st + end))`, and the value of `ans` is being printed. The first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is updated to be the maximum of 0 and the difference between the length of the list `a` and the sum of the number of consecutive equal elements at the beginning and end of `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is being printed.
