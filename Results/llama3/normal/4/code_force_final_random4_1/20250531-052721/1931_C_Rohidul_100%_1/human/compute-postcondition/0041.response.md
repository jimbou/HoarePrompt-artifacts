Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `le` is equal to `n`, `l` is equal to `r`, `st` is equal to `l + 1`, `end` is equal to the number of consecutive equal elements at the end of the list `a`, `ans` is equal to `max(0, le - (l + 1 + end))` if the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, otherwise `ans` is equal to `le - max(l + 1, end)`.***
