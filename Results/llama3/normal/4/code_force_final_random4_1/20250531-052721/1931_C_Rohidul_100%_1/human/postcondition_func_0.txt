This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a list of n integers. It then analyzes the list to find the number of consecutive equal elements at the beginning and end of the list, and calculates the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the list either empty or have no consecutive equal elements at the beginning and end. The function prints this minimum number for each test case.
