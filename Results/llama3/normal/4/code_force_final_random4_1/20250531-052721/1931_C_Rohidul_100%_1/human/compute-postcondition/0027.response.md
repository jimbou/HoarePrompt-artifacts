The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line increments the value of `l` by 1, and the second line increments the value of `st` by 1. 

Since `l` is initially 1, after the first line, `l` becomes 2. Similarly, since `st` is initially 2, after the second line, `st` becomes 3.

No other variables are affected by the code snippet. The values of `n`, `a`, `le`, `r`, and `end` remain unchanged. The state of stdin also remains unchanged as no input operation is performed.

Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, a is a list of n integers where the first three elements are equal, le is equal to n, l is 2, r is n - 1, st is 3, end is 1, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers**
