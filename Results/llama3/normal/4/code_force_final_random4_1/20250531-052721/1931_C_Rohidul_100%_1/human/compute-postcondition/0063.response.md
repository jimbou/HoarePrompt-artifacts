Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `le` is equal to `n`, `l` is equal to the index of the first element in `a` that is not equal to the first element in `a`, `r` is equal to the index of the last element in `a` that is equal to the last element in `a`, `st` is equal to the number of consecutive equal elements at the beginning of `a`, `end` is equal to the number of consecutive equal elements at the end of `a`. If the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, then `ans` is equal to `max(0, le - (st + end))`, otherwise `ans` is equal to `le - max(st, end)`, and the value of `ans` is being printed.**
