The `print(ans)` statement will print the calculated value of `ans`, which depends on the conditions specified in the initial state.

If the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, then `ans` is equal to `max(0, n - (st + end))`. This means that `ans` will be the maximum of 0 and the difference between the total number of elements `n` and the sum of the number of equal elements at the start `st` and the end `end`. Since `st` and `end` are the number of equal elements at the start and end of the list, respectively, `st + end` represents the total number of equal elements in the list. Therefore, `n - (st + end)` represents the number of non-equal elements in the list. The `max` function ensures that this value is not negative.

On the other hand, if the first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a`, then `ans` is equal to `n - max(st, end)`. This means that `ans` will be the difference between the total number of elements `n` and the maximum of the number of equal elements at the start `st` and the end `end`. Since `st` and `end` are the number of equal elements at the start and end of the list, respectively, `max(st, end)` represents the maximum number of equal elements at either the start or the end of the list. Therefore, `n - max(st, end)` represents the number of elements that are not part of the longest sequence of equal elements at either the start or the end of the list.

In summary, the `print(ans)` statement will print the number of elements in the list `a` that are not part of the longest sequence of equal elements at either the start or the end of the list, or the number of non-equal elements in the list, depending on whether the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`.

Output: **the number of elements in the list `a` that are not part of the longest sequence of equal elements at either the start or the end of the list, or the number of non-equal elements in the list**
