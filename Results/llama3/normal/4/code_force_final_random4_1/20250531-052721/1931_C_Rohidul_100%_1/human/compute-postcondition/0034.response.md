Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, a is a list of n integers, le is equal to n, l is equal to r - 1, st is equal to l + 1, end is 3, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers, r is at least l + 1, and a[r] is equal to a[r-1] and a[r] is equal to a[r-2].**

The code snippet modifies the values of `r` and `end`. The first line decrements `r` by 1, and the second line increments `end` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `r` is at least `l + 1` initially, after decrementing `r` by 1, it is still at least `l`. The value of `end` becomes 3 after incrementing it by 1. The rest of the variables, including `n`, `a`, `le`, `l`, `st`, and `stdin`, retain their initial values.
