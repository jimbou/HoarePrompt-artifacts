Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, a is a list of n integers, le is equal to n, l is equal to the index of the first element in a that is not equal to the first element in a, r is equal to the index of the last element in a that is equal to the last element in a, st is equal to the number of consecutive equal elements at the beginning of a, end is equal to the number of consecutive equal elements at the end of a. If the first element of a is equal to the last element of a, then ans is equal to max(0, le - (st + end)), otherwise ans is equal to le - max(st, end), and the value of ans is being printed.**

This output state describes the final state of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations. The loop has processed all the test cases, and the variables have been updated accordingly. The value of `ans` is being printed for each test case, which represents the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from the list `a` to make all elements equal.
