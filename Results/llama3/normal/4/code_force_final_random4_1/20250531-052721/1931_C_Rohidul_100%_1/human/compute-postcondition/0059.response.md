Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, a is a list of n integers, le is equal to n, l is equal to the index of the first element in a that is not equal to the first element in a, r is equal to the index of the last element in a that is equal to the last element in a, st is equal to the number of consecutive equal elements at the beginning of a, end is equal to the number of consecutive equal elements at the end of a, and the value of ans is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: the loop will continue to execute until r is no longer greater than l or a[r] is no longer equal to a[r - 1]. At this point, r will be equal to the index of the last element in a that is equal to the last element in a, and end will be equal to the number of consecutive equal elements at the end of a. The other variables will remain unchanged.
