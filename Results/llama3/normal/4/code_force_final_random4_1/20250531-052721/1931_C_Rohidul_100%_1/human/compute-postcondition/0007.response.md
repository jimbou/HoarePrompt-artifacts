Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers where the first, second, third, and fourth elements are equal, le is equal to n, l is 3, r is n - 1, st is 4, end is 1, stdin contains t - 1 test cases**

The code modifies the values of `l` and `st`. The first line increments `l` by 1, making it 3. The second line increments `st` by 1, making it 4. The values of `n`, `a`, `le`, `r`, `end`, and the contents of stdin remain unchanged.
