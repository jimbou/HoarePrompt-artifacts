#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, edges is a list of pairs of integers between 1 and n (inclusive), and start is an integer between 1 and n (inclusive). The edges represent a tree with exactly two leaves, and the start node is one of the nodes in the tree.
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        
        tree[v].append(u)
        
    #State: n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, edges is a list of pairs of integers between 1 and n (inclusive), start is an integer between 1 and n (inclusive), tree is a dictionary with keys being all unique elements from edges, and for each key k in tree, tree[k] is a list of all elements that appear in a pair with k in edges.
    leaves = [node for node in tree if len(tree[node]) == 1]
    dist1 = bfs(start, leaves[0])
    dist2 = bfs(start, leaves[1])
    if (dist1 % 2 == 0 or dist2 % 2 == 0) :
        return 'Ron'
        #The program returns the string 'Ron'.
    else :
        return 'Hermione'
        #The program returns the string 'Hermione'.

#Overall this is what the function does:Determines the winner of a game played on a tree with exactly two leaves, given the tree's edges and a start node. The function returns 'Ron' if the distance from the start node to either leaf is even, and 'Hermione' otherwise.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: start and target are integers representing nodes in the tree, and tree is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes.
    queue = deque([(start, 0)])
    visited = set([start])
    while queue:
        current, dist = queue.popleft()
        
        if current == target:
            return dist
        
        for neighbor in tree[current]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
    #State: `start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree, `tree` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes, `queue` is an empty deque, `visited` is a set containing all nodes in the tree, `current` is the last node that was visited, and `dist` is the distance from the `start` node to the `current` node in the tree. If `current` is equal to `target`, the program returns the distance `dist` that was previously the leftmost element in the queue, which is the distance from the start node to the current node in the tree. Otherwise, the program continues without returning any value.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1, which is an integer value.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the shortest distance between two nodes (`start` and `target`) in a tree represented as a dictionary. It performs a breadth-first search (BFS) traversal of the tree, exploring neighboring nodes level by level, until it finds the target node or exhausts all nodes. If the target node is found, the function returns the distance from the start node to the target node. If the target node is not found after exploring all nodes, the function returns -1.
