Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: start and target are integers representing nodes in the tree, tree is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes, queue is a deque containing a tuple of start and 0, visited is a set containing start
Code of the loop:
while queue:
    current, dist = queue.popleft()
    if current == target:
        return dist
    for neighbor in tree[current]:
        if neighbor not in visited:
            visited.add(neighbor)
            queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree, `tree` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes, `queue` is a deque containing tuples of nodes and distances, `visited` is a set containing `start`, `current` is `start`, `dist` is 0, and `current` is not equal to `target`
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`start`, `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree, `tree` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes, `queue` is a deque containing tuples of nodes and distances with one less element, `visited` is a set containing `start`, `current` is the node that was previously the leftmost element in the queue, `dist` is the distance that was previously the leftmost element in the queue. If `current` is equal to `target`, the program returns the distance 'dist' that was previously the leftmost element in the queue, which represents the distance from the 'start' node to the 'current' node in the tree. Otherwise, the program does not return any value.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`start`, `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree, `tree` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes, `queue` is a deque containing tuples of nodes and distances with at least one less element than before, `visited` is a set containing `start`, `current` is the node that was previously the leftmost element in the queue, `dist` is the distance that was previously the leftmost element in the queue. If `current` is equal to `target`, the program returns the distance `dist` that was previously the leftmost element in the queue, which is the distance from the start node to the current node in the tree. Otherwise, the program continues without returning any value.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
