Output State: **The program returns the distance between the start node and the target node, which is initially 0.**

In this output state, the program returns the value of the variable `dist`, which is initially set to 0. This value represents the distance between the `start` node and the `target` node in the tree. Since the initial value of `dist` is 0, the program returns 0, indicating that the distance between the start node and the target node is 0.
