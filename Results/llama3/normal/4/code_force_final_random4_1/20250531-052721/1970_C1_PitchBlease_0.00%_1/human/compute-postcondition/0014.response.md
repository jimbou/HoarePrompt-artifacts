Output State: **`start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree, `tree` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes, `queue` is an empty deque, `visited` is a set containing all nodes in the tree, `current` is the last node that was visited, and `dist` is the distance from the `start` node to the `current` node in the tree. If `current` is equal to `target`, the program returns the distance `dist` that was previously the leftmost element in the queue, which is the distance from the start node to the current node in the tree. Otherwise, the program continues without returning any value.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the queue is empty, all nodes in the tree have been visited, and the current node is the last node that was visited. If the current node is the target node, the program returns the distance from the start node to the current node in the tree. Otherwise, the program continues without returning any value.
