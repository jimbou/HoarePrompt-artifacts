The code `current, dist = queue.popleft()` removes the leftmost element from the queue and assigns it to the variables `current` and `dist`. Since the queue is a non-empty deque containing tuples of nodes and distances, the leftmost element is a tuple containing a node and its distance.

Output State: **`start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree, `tree` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes, `queue` is a deque containing tuples of nodes and distances with one less element, `visited` is a set containing `start`, `current` is the node that was previously the leftmost element in the queue, `dist` is the distance that was previously the leftmost element in the queue, and `current` is not equal to `target`.**
