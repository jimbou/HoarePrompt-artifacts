The code removes the leftmost element from the queue and assigns it to the variables `current` and `dist`. The queue now contains one less element than before. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`start`, `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree, `tree` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes, `queue` is a deque containing tuples of nodes and distances with at least one less element than before, `visited` is a set containing `start`, `current` is the node that was previously the leftmost element in the queue, `dist` is the distance that was previously the leftmost element in the queue.**
