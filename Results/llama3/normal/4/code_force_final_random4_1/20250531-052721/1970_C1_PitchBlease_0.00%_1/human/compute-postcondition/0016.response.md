Functionality: **This function calculates the shortest distance between two nodes (`start` and `target`) in a tree represented as a dictionary. It performs a breadth-first search (BFS) traversal of the tree, exploring neighboring nodes level by level, until it finds the target node or exhausts all nodes. If the target node is found, the function returns the distance from the start node to the target node. If the target node is not found after exploring all nodes, the function returns -1.**
