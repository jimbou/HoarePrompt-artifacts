Postcondition: ***`start`, `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree, `tree` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes, `queue` is a deque containing tuples of nodes and distances with at least one less element than before, `visited` is a set containing `start`, `current` is the node that was previously the leftmost element in the queue, `dist` is the distance that was previously the leftmost element in the queue. If `current` is equal to `target`, the program returns the distance `dist` that was previously the leftmost element in the queue, which is the distance from the start node to the current node in the tree. Otherwise, the program continues without returning any value.***
