The code removes the leftmost element from the queue and assigns it to the variables `current` and `dist`. Since the queue initially contains a tuple of `start` and 0, these values are assigned to `current` and `dist`, respectively.

Output State: **`start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree, `tree` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes, `queue` is a deque containing tuples of nodes and distances, `visited` is a set containing `start`, `current` is `start`, and `dist` is 0.**
