To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `tests`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `tests`. If `i` is less than `tests`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `tests` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive).

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `tests` remains the same.

State: **`tests` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `tests - 1` test cases, each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 20) followed by three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `i` is 1, `slength` is an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive), `a` is a string consisting of exactly `slength` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string consisting of exactly `slength` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string consisting of exactly `slength` lowercase Latin letters.**
