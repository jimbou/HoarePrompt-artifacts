Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by three strings a, b, and c, each of length n. It then checks if string c is equal to either a or b, or if any character in c is present in either a or b. If either condition is true, it prints 'NO', otherwise it prints 'YES'. The function processes all test cases and prints the corresponding results.**
