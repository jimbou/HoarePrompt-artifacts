Output State: **tests is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains tests - 2 test cases, each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters, i is 1, slength is an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive), a is a string consisting of exactly slength lowercase Latin letters, b is a string consisting of exactly slength lowercase Latin letters, c is a string consisting of exactly slength lowercase Latin letters, no is True.**

The code snippet reads the first test case from stdin, which consists of an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`. The value of `n` is assigned to `slength`, and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c` are read from stdin. The variable `no` is set to `True`. The remaining test cases are still in stdin, with `tests - 2` test cases left. The values of `tests`, `i`, and the remaining test cases in stdin are not modified by the code.
