Output State: **tests is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains tests - 1 test cases, each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters, i is 0, slength is an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive), a is a string consisting of exactly slength lowercase Latin letters, b is a string consisting of exactly slength lowercase Latin letters, c is a string consisting of exactly slength lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 2 characters, no is False**.

The code snippet does not modify the values of `tests`, `stdin`, `i`, `slength`, `a`, `b`, or `c`. The variable `no` is assigned the value `False`, and the `break` statement does not affect the state of the program since it is not inside a loop.
