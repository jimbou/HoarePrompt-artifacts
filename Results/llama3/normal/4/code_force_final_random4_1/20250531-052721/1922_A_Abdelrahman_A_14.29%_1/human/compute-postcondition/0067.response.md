Postcondition: ***`tests` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `slength` is an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive), `a` is a string consisting of exactly `slength` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string consisting of exactly `slength` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string consisting of at least 1 lowercase Latin letter, `stdin` contains `tests - 3` test cases, each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `x` is the first character of string `c`. If the first character `x` of string `c` is not present in `a` and not present in `b`, then `no` is set to False and 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
