The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `tests`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tests`. If `tests` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `tests` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains `tests` test cases, each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters. So for the loop to be executed  the `tests` must be greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.
State: **`tests` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains `tests` test cases, each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters, `i` is 0**
