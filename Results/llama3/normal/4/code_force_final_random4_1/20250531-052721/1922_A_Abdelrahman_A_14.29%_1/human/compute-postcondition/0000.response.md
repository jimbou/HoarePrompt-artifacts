The code `tests = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `tests`. The stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t test cases. Since the first integer t is consumed by the input() function, the stdin now contains t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output State: **`tests` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains `tests` test cases, each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.**
