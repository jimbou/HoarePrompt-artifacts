Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: tests is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains tests - 1 test cases, each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters, i is 0, slength is an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive), a is a string consisting of exactly slength lowercase Latin letters, b is a string consisting of exactly slength lowercase Latin letters, c is a string consisting of exactly slength lowercase Latin letters, no is True, and c is not equal to a and c is not equal to b
Code of the loop:
for x in c:
    if x not in a and x not in b:
        print('YES')
        no = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *tests is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains tests - 1 test cases, each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters, i is 0, slength is an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive), a is a string consisting of exactly slength lowercase Latin letters, b is a string consisting of exactly slength lowercase Latin letters, c is a string consisting of exactly slength lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 1 character, if the first character x of string c is not present in either string a or string b, then no is False and x is the first character in the string c. Otherwise, no remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: tests is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains tests - 1 test cases, each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters, i is 0, slength is an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive), a is a string consisting of exactly slength lowercase Latin letters, b is a string consisting of exactly slength lowercase Latin letters, c is a string consisting of exactly slength lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 2 characters, if the first character x of string c is not present in either string a or string b, then no is False and x is the second character in the string c. Otherwise, no remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *tests is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains tests - 1 test cases, each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters, i is 0, slength is an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive), a is a string consisting of exactly slength lowercase Latin letters, b is a string consisting of exactly slength lowercase Latin letters, c is a string consisting of exactly slength lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 2 characters. If the first character x of string c is not present in either string a or string b, then no is False and x is the second character in the string c. Otherwise, no remains True.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
