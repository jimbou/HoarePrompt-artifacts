Postcondition: ***tests is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains tests - 2 test cases, each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters, i is 1, slength is an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive), a is a string consisting of exactly slength lowercase Latin letters, b is a string consisting of exactly slength lowercase Latin letters, c is a string consisting of exactly slength lowercase Latin letters. If c is equal to a or b, then 'NO' is printed. If c is not equal to a or b and the last character of c is in either a or b, then 'NO' is printed. If c is not equal to a or b and the last character of c is not in either a or b, then 'YES' is printed.***
