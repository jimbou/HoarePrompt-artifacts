Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The program checks if string c is equal to either a or b, which is not a necessary condition for the existence of a template t that matches a and b but not c. It also checks if any character in c is present in either a or b, which is not a sufficient condition for the non-existence of such a template.

A correct program should check if there exists a position i such that a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]. If such a position exists, then a template t can be constructed by making t[i] the uppercase version of c[i], and making all other characters in t the same as the corresponding characters in a or b. This template will match a and b but not c.

Correctness: **False**
