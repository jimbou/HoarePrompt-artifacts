The only variable in the loop head is variable  x and string c, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string c. If the string c has at least 2 characters the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, c is a string consisting of at least 1 lowercase Latin letter, x is the first character of string c. So for the loop to be executed one more time the string c must have at least 2 characters and the x is the second character of string c.
State: **`tests` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `slength` is an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive), `a` is a string consisting of exactly `slength` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string consisting of exactly `slength` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string consisting of at least 2 lowercase Latin letters, `stdin` contains `tests - 3` test cases, each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `x` is the second character of string `c`.**
