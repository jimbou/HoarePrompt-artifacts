Output State: **tests is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains tests - 2 test cases, each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters, i is 1, slength is an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive), a is a string consisting of exactly slength lowercase Latin letters, b is a string consisting of exactly slength lowercase Latin letters, c is a string consisting of exactly slength lowercase Latin letters and must have at least slength characters, x is the last character in c, no is False. If x is not in a and not in b, then 'YES' is printed.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated over all characters in string c. The variable x is now the last character in c. If this character is not present in strings a and b, the program prints 'YES' and sets no to False. If the character is present in either a or b, the program does not print anything and no remains True. The state of other variables remains unchanged.
