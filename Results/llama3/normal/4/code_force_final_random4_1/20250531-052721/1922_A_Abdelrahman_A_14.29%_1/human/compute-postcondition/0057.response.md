The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `tests`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `tests`. If `i` is less than `tests`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `tests` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `tests` must be greater than 2.
State: **`tests` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains tests - 2 test cases, each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters, i is 2, slength is an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive), a is a string consisting of exactly slength lowercase Latin letters, b is a string consisting of exactly slength lowercase Latin letters, c is a string consisting of exactly slength lowercase Latin letters. If c is equal to a or b, then 'NO' is printed. If c is not equal to a or b and the last character of c is in either a or b, then 'NO' is printed. If c is not equal to a or b and the last character of c is not in either a or b, then 'YES' is printed.**
