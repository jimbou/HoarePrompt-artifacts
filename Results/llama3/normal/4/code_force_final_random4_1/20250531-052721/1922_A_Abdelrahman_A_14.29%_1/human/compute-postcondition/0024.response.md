Output State: **tests is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains tests - 1 test cases, each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters, i is 0, slength is an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive), a is a string consisting of exactly slength lowercase Latin letters, b is a string consisting of exactly slength lowercase Latin letters, c is a string consisting of exactly slength lowercase Latin letters that must have at least slength characters. If any character x of string c is not present in either string a or string b, then no is False and x is the last character in the string c that is not present in either string a or string b. Otherwise, no remains True.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the state of the variables remains the same as in the initial state, except for the variable "no" and the string "c". The string "c" must have at least as many characters as its length, and if any character in "c" is not present in either string "a" or string "b", then "no" is False and the last character in "c" that is not present in either "a" or "b" is the one that caused the loop to terminate. If no such character is found, "no" remains True.
