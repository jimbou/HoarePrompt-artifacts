Output State: **tests is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains 0 test cases, each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters, i is tests - 1, slength is an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive), a is a string consisting of exactly slength lowercase Latin letters, b is a string consisting of exactly slength lowercase Latin letters, c is a string consisting of exactly slength lowercase Latin letters. If c is equal to a or b, then 'NO' is printed. If c is not equal to a or b and the last character of c is in either a or b, then 'NO' is printed. If c is not equal to a or b and the last character of c is not in either a or b, then 'YES' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has processed all the test cases in the input, and the values of the variables in the loop head and body have been updated accordingly. The variable `i` now holds the value of `tests - 1`, indicating that the loop has executed `tests` times. The input stream `stdin` is now empty, as all test cases have been processed. The variables `slength`, `a`, `b`, and `c` hold the values of the last test case processed. The output state also indicates that the loop has printed either 'NO' or 'YES' for each test case, depending on the conditions specified in the loop body.
