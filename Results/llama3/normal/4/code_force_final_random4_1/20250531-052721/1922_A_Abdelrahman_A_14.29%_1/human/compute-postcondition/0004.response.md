Output State: **tests is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains tests - 1 test cases, each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters, i is 0, slength is an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive), a is a string consisting of exactly slength lowercase Latin letters, b is a string consisting of exactly slength lowercase Latin letters, c is a string consisting of exactly slength lowercase Latin letters, and no is False, and the current value of c is equal to either a or b.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of tests is between 1 and 1000, and there are tests - 1 test cases left in the standard input. Each test case consists of an integer n followed by three strings a, b, and c, all of the same length n. The variable i is still 0, and the length of the strings a, b, and c is between 1 and 20. The strings a, b, and c consist of lowercase Latin letters, and c is equal to either a or b. The variable no is now set to False.
