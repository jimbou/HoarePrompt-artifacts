The only variable in the loop head is variable `x` and `c`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `c`. If `c` has at least 2 characters the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `c` has at least 1 character, `x` is the first character in `c`, `no` is False and 'YES' is printed. So for the loop to be executed one more time the string `c` must have at least 2 characters and `x` is the second character in `c`.
State: **tests is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains tests - 2 test cases, each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters, i is 1, slength is an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive), a is a string consisting of exactly slength lowercase Latin letters, b is a string consisting of exactly slength lowercase Latin letters, c is a string consisting of exactly slength lowercase Latin letters and must have at least 2 characters, x is the second character in c, no is False**
