To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `x` and the string `c`. The loop will execute if `c` has at least one character. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `c` to ensure it has at least one character.

State: **`tests` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `tests - 2` test cases, each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 20) followed by three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `i` is 1, `slength` is an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive), `a` is a string consisting of exactly `slength` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string consisting of exactly `slength` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string consisting of exactly `slength` lowercase Latin letters and must have at least 1 character, `no` is True, `x` is the first character in `c`**
