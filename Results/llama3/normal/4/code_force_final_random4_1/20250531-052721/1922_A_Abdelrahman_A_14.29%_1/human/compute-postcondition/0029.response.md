Postcondition: ***tests is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains tests - 1 test cases, each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters, i is 0, slength is an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive), a is a string consisting of exactly slength lowercase Latin letters, b is a string consisting of exactly slength lowercase Latin letters, c is a string consisting of exactly slength lowercase Latin letters. If c is equal to either a or b, or if any character x of string c is not present in either string a or string b, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, the current value of no is True, indicating that c is not equal to either a or b, and every character x of string c is present in either string a or string b, and 'NO' is printed.***
