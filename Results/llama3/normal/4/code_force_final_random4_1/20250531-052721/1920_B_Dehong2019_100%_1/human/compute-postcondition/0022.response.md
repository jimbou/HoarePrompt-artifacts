The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and k, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `k` must be greater than 3.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 3, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a` plus the first integer in `a` minus twice the (i+x)th integer in `a` if `i` plus `x` is less than `n` plus the (i+1)th integer in `a` minus twice the (i+x)th integer in `a` if `i` plus `x` is less than `n`, otherwise `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a` plus the first integer in `a`, `ans2` is the maximum of the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a` plus the first integer in `a` minus twice the (i+x)th integer in `a` if `i` plus `x` is less than `n` plus the (i+1)th integer in `a` minus twice the (i+x)th integer in `a` if `i` plus `x` is less than `n`, otherwise the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a` plus the first integer in `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 3**
