Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than -1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `x-1` plus `a[0]` plus `a[i]`, `ans2` is the maximum of the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `x-1` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `x-1` plus `a[0]`, `i` is an integer greater than or equal to 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans1` has been updated by adding the integer at index `i` of the sorted list `a` to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged.
