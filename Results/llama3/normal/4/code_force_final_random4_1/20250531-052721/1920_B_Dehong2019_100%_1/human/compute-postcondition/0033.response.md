Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than -1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the first integer in `a`, `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and the previous value of `ans2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `ans1` has been updated to be the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the first integer in `a`, since `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order and `i` is 0, which refers to the first integer in `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
