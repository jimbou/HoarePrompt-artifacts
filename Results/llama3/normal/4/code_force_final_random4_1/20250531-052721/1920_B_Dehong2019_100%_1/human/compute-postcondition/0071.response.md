Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `x-1` plus `a[0]`, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `x-1`, the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `x-1` has been printed, `i` is 0, and the current value of `i` plus `x` is less than `n`***
