Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `_` is `t`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `i` is `k-1`, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `x-1` plus the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `k-1` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index `x` to `k+x-1`, `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `x-1` and the maximum of the previous `ans1` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `x-1`, and the maximum of `ans1` and the previous value of `ans2` has been printed for `t` times, and `stdin` is empty.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the variable `_` has reached the value of `t`. The variables `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `i`, `ans1`, and `ans2` have the same values as after the third iteration. The maximum value of `ans1` and the previous value of `ans2` has been printed for `t` times, and the input stream `stdin` is empty, indicating that all test cases have been processed.
