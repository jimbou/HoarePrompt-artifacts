Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is `x-1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    ans1 += a[i]
    if i + x < n:
        ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2
    ans2 = max(ans1, ans2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a` plus the first integer in `a` minus twice the (i+x)th integer in `a` if `i` plus `x` is less than `n`, `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a` plus the first integer in `a` minus twice the (i+x)th integer in `a` if `i` plus `x` is less than `n` plus the (i+1)th integer in `a` minus twice the (i+x)th integer in `a` if `i` plus `x` is less than `n`, otherwise `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a` plus the first integer in `a`, `ans2` is the maximum of the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a` plus the first integer in `a` minus twice the (i+x)th integer in `a` if `i` plus `x` is less than `n` plus the (i+1)th integer in `a` minus twice the (i+x)th integer in `a` if `i` plus `x` is less than `n`, otherwise the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a` plus the first integer in `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 2

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 3, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a` plus the first integer in `a` minus twice the (i+x)th integer in `a` if `i` plus `x` is less than `n` plus the (i+1)th integer in `a` minus twice the (i+x)th integer in `a` if `i` plus `x` is less than `n`, otherwise `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a` plus the first integer in `a` plus the 4th integer in `a` minus twice the (3+x)th integer in `a`, `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and the previous value of `ans2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
