Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer at least 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the largest integer in `a` minus twice the second largest integer in `a` minus twice the third largest integer in `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 2**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` is still an integer greater than 0, `_` is still 0, `n` and `k` are still integers, `x` is still an integer at least 3, `a` is still a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans1` has been updated to be the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the largest integer in `a` minus twice the second largest integer in `a` minus twice the third largest integer in `a`, `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and `i` is still 2.
