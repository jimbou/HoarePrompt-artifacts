Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than -1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `x-1` plus `a[0]` plus `a[i]` minus 2 times `a[i + x]`, `ans2` is the maximum of the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `x-1` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `x-1` plus `a[0]`, `i` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.**

In this output state, the value of `ans1` has been updated by subtracting 2 times the value of `a[i + x]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` is still sorted in descending order, and the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `ans2`, and `i` are the same as in the initial state.
