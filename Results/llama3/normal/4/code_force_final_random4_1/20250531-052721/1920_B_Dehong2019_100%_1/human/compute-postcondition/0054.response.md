Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than -1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order. If `i + x` is less than `n`, `ans1` is decreased by an even integer, otherwise `ans1` is increased by the value of `a[i]`. `ans2` remains unchanged.***
