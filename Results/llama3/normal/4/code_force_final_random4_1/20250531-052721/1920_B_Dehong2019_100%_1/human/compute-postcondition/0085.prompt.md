Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `x-1`, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `x-1`, `i` is `x-1`, and the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `x-1` has been printed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    ans1 += a[i]
    if i + x < n:
        ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2
    ans2 = max(ans1, ans2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `x-1` plus `a[0]`, `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `x-1`, `i` is 0, and the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `x-1` has been printed. If `i` plus `x` is less than `n`, then `ans1` is updated to be the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `x-1` plus `a[0]` minus 2 times `a[i+x]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than 1, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `i` is 1, the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `x-1` has been printed. If `i + x` is less than `n`, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `x-1` plus `a[0]` plus `a[1]` minus 2 times `a[i + x]`, and `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `x-1`. Otherwise, `ans2` is the maximum of the previous `ans1` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `x-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than 2, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `i` is 2, the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `x-1` has been printed. If `i + x` is less than `n`, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `x-1` plus `a[0]` plus `a[1]` minus 4 times `a[i + x]` plus `a[2]`, and `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `x-1` and the maximum of the previous `ans1` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `x-1`. Otherwise, `ans2` is the maximum of the previous `ans1` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `x-1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
