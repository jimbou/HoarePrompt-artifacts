Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a` plus the first integer in `a` minus twice the (i+x)th integer in `a` if `i` plus `x` is less than `n` plus the (i+1)th integer in `a`, `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `ans1` has been updated by adding the (i+1)th integer in `a`, which is the second integer in `a` since `i` is 1. The value of `i` has also been updated to 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
