Output State: **t is an integer greater than -1, _ is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer greater than or equal to 0, x is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers in descending order, ans1 is the sum of the integers in a, ans2 is the maximum of ans1 and the previous value of ans2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, i is k-1, and the maximum value of ans1 and the previous value of ans2 is being printed**

The code snippet reads two lines of input from stdin, assigning the values to `n`, `k`, and `x`. The first line of input is split into three integers, and the second line is split into a list of integers, which is then sorted in descending order and assigned to `a`. The value of `ans1` is updated to be the sum of the integers in `a`. The value of `ans2` remains unchanged, as it is not modified in the code snippet. The value of `i` remains unchanged, as it is not modified in the code snippet. The maximum value of `ans1` and the previous value of `ans2` is still being printed.
