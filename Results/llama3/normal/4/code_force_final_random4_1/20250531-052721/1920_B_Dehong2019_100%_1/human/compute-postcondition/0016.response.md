Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a` plus the first integer in `a` minus twice the (i+x)th integer in `a` if `i` plus `x` is less than `n`, `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans2` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `ans1`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans1` is still dependent on the condition `i` plus `x` being less than `n`.
