The code `ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2` subtracts twice the value of the element at index `i + x` in list `a` from `ans1`. The value of `a[i + x]` is an integer because `a` is a list of integers. The value of `i + x` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 because `i` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and `x` is an integer. The value of `a[i + x] * 2` is an even integer because it is twice an integer.

The value of `ans1` is decreased by an even integer because it is decreased by `a[i + x] * 2`, which is an even integer. The value of `ans1` was increased by the value of `a[i]`, which is an integer, so the new value of `ans1` is the previous value of `ans1` minus an even integer.

The values of the other variables are not affected by the code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than -1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `i` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `ans1` is decreased by an even integer, `ans2` is unchanged.**
