Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than -1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `x-1`, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `x-1`, `i` is `x-1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` is still an integer greater than -1, `_` is still 1, `n` is still an integer, `k` is still an integer greater than or equal to 0, `x` is still an integer, `a` is still a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is still the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `x-1`, `ans2` is now equal to `ans1`, `i` is still `x-1`, and stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
