Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than -1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `i` is an integer greater than or equal to 1. If `i + x` is less than `n`, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `x-1` plus `a[0]` plus `a[i]` minus 2 times `a[i + x]`, and `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `x-1` plus `a[0]`. Otherwise, the values of `ans1` and `ans2` remain unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `ans2` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `ans1`. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `ans1` and `ans2` are still dependent on the value of `i + x` being less than `n`.
