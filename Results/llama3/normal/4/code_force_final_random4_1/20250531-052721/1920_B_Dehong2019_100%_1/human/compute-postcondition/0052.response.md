Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than -1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `i` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `ans1` is increased by the value of `a[i]`, `ans2` is unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `ans1` has been updated by adding the value of `a[i]` to it. Since `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, the value of `a[i]` is one of the elements in the list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
