Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the integer at index 0 in `a` minus 2 times the integer at index 1 in `a` minus 2 times the integer at index 2 in `a`, `ans2` is the maximum of the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `x-1` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `x-1` plus the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `k-1` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index `x` to `x+k-1`, `i` is 2, and the maximum of the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `x-1` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `x-1` plus the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `k-1` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index `x` to `x+k-1` has been printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` is still an integer greater than 1, `_` is still 2, `n` is still an integer, `k` is still an integer, `x` is still an integer greater than 2, `a` is still a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans1` has been updated to be the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the integer at index 0 in `a` minus 2 times the integer at index 1 in `a` minus 2 times the integer at index 2 in `a`, `ans2` is still the maximum of the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `x-1` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `x-1` plus the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `k-1` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index `x` to `x+k-1`, `i` is still 2, and the maximum of the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `x-1` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `x-1` plus the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `k-1` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index `x` to `x+k-1` has been printed.
