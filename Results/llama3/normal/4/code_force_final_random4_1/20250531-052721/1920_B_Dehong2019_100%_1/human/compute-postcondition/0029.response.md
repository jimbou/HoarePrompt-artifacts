Output: ** `t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a` plus the sum of the first `k` integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the integers in `a` from index `x` to `x+k-1` if `x+k-1` is less than `n`, otherwise `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a` plus the sum of the first `k` integers in `a`, `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and the previous value of `ans2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is `k-1`, and the maximum value of `ans1` and the previous value of `ans2` is being printed**
