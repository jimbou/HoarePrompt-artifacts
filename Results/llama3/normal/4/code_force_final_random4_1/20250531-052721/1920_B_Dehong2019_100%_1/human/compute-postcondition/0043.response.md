Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than -1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `x-1` plus `a[0]` minus 2 times `a[i+x]`, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `x-1`, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. The current value of `i` plus `x` is less than `n`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans1` has been updated by subtracting 2 times the value of `a[i+x]` from its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and the current value of `i` plus `x` is still less than `n`.
