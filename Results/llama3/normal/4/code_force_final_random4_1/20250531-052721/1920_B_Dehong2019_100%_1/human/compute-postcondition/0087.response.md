Output: ** `t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `i` is `k-1`, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `x-1` plus the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `k-1` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index `x` to `k+x-1`, `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `x-1` and the maximum of the previous `ans1` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `x-1`, and the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `x-1` has been printed, and `ans2` is printed**
