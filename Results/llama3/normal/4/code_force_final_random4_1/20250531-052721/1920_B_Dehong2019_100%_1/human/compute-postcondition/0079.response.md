Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than 1, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `i` is 1, the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `x-1` has been printed. If `i + x` is less than `n`, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `x-1` plus `a[0]` plus `a[1]` minus 2 times `a[i + x]`, and `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `x-1`. Otherwise, `ans2` is the maximum of the previous `ans1` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `x-1`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `ans2` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `ans1`. This means that if `ans1` is greater than the previous `ans2`, then `ans2` will be updated to be equal to `ans1`. Otherwise, `ans2` will remain the same.
