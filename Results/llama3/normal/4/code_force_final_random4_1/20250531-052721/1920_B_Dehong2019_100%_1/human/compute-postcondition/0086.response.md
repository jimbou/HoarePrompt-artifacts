The code prints the value of `ans2`, which is the maximum of `ans1` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `x-1` and the maximum of the previous `ans1` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `x-1`, and the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `x-1`. 

Since the exact values of `a`, `x`, `k`, and `ans1` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans2`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated maximum value.

Output: **ans2 (where ans2 is the maximum of ans1 and the sum of the integers in a minus 2 times the sum of the integers in a from index 0 to x-1 and the maximum of the previous ans1 and the sum of the integers in a minus 2 times the sum of the integers in a from index 0 to x-1, and the sum of the integers in a minus 2 times the sum of the integers in a from index 0 to x-1)**
