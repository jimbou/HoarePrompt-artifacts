The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `t`. Since `t` is an integer, and the input is a single integer, `t` becomes equal to that integer. The number of test cases is specified by `t`, which is now an integer. No other variables are affected. Stdin now contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, k, and x (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= x, k <= n). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 1000). 
Output State: **t is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, k, and x (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= x, k <= n). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 1000).**
