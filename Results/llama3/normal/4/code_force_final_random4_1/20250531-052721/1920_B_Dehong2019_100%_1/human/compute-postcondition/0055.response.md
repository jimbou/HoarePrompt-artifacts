Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than -1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order. If `i + x` is less than `n`, `ans1` is decreased by an even integer, otherwise `ans1` is increased by the value of `a[i]`. `ans2` is the maximum of its previous value and `ans1`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans2` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `ans1`. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions on `ans1` are still valid, depending on the value of `i + x` relative to `n`.
