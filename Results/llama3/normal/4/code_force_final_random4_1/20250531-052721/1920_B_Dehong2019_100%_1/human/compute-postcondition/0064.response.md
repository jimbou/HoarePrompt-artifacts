In natural language, the output state is: `t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the integer at index 0 in `a` minus 2 times the integer at index 1 in `a`, `ans2` is the maximum of the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `x-1` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `x-1` plus the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `k-1` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index `x` to `x+k-1`, `i` is 1, and the maximum of the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `x-1` and the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `x-1` plus the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `k-1` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` from index `x` to `x+k-1` is being printed.
