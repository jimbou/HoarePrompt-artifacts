Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, k, and x, and the second line contains n integers. The function processes each test case by sorting the integers in descending order, calculating the sum of the integers minus 2 times the sum of the first x integers, and then iteratively adding and subtracting integers from the sum while keeping track of the maximum sum. The function prints the maximum sum for each test case.**
