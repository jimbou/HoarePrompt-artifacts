Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a` plus the first integer in `a` minus twice the (i+x)th integer in `a`, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 0. The current value of `i` plus `x` is less than `n`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans1` has been updated by subtracting twice the (i+x)th integer in `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that the current value of `i` plus `x` is less than `n` is still valid.
