Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, _ is 2, n is an integer, k is an integer, x is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers in descending order, ans1 is the sum of the integers in a, ans2 is the maximum of the sum of the integers in a minus 2 times the sum of the integers in a from index 0 to x-1 and the sum of the integers in a minus 2 times the sum of the integers in a from index 0 to x-1 plus the sum of the integers in a from index 0 to k-1 minus 2 times the sum of the integers in a from index x to x+k-1, i is k-1, and the maximum of the sum of the integers in a minus 2 times the sum of the integers in a from index 0 to x-1 and the sum of the integers in a minus 2 times the sum of the integers in a from index 0 to x-1 plus the sum of the integers in a from index 0 to k-1 minus 2 times the sum of the integers in a from index x to x+k-1 is being printed.**

The first line assigns the integer values of the input to `n`, `k`, and `x`. The second line assigns a sorted list of integers in descending order to `a`. The third line assigns the sum of the integers in `a` to `ans1`. The values of `t`, `_`, `ans2`, and `i` remain unchanged.
