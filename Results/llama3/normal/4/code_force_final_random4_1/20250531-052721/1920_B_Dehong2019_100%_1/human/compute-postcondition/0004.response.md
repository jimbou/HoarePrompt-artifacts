The code `ans1 -= a[i] * 2` subtracts twice the value of the integer at index `i` in list `a` from `ans1`. Since `i` is 0, this means we are subtracting twice the largest integer in `a` (since `a` is sorted in descending order) from `ans1`. The value of `ans1` is now the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the largest integer in `a`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer at least 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the largest integer in `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 0**
