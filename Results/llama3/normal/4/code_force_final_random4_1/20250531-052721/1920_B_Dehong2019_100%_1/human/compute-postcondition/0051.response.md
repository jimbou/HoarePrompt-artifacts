To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `k`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is an integer greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes an integer greater than or equal to 2. The value of `k` remains unchanged.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than -1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `i` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `ans1` and `ans2` are unchanged**
