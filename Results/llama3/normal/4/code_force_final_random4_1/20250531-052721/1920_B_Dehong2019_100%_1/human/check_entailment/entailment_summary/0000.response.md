Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the game strategy described in the problem statement. The program first sorts the array in descending order, which allows Alice to remove the largest elements and Bob to multiply the largest elements by -1. The program then calculates the sum of the array after Alice's removals and Bob's multiplications, and keeps track of the maximum sum. The program correctly handles the case where Alice removes elements and Bob multiplies elements by -1, and it correctly prints the maximum sum for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
