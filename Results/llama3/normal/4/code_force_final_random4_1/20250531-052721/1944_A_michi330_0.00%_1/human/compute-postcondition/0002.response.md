Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 0 and n*(n-1)/2 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n <= 100, 0 <= k <= n*(n-1)/2)**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The variables `n` and `k` are assigned the values of the first line of input from stdin, which contains two integers `n` and `k` within the specified ranges. The stdin now contains `t-1` lines, as one line has been consumed by the input operation.
