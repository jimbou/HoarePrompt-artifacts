Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 0 and n*(n-1)/2 inclusive, `n` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, `k` is assigned the value of the second integer from the input, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n <= 100, 0 <= k <= n*(n-1)/2).**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the values read from the input. The stdin now contains `t-2` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, because one line has been read and processed.
