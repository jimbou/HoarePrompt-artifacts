The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^3) first, and that integer is assigned to `t`. So stdin now contains t lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n <= 100, 0 <= k <= n*(n-1)/2).

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^3), stdin contains t lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n <= 100, 0 <= k <= n*(n-1)/2)**
