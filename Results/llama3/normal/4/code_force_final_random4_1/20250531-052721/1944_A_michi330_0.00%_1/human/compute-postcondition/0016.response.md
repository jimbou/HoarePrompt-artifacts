Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 0 and n*(n-1)/2 inclusive, `n` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, `k` is assigned the value of the second integer from the input, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n <= 100, 0 <= k <= n*(n-1)/2). If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, the number 1 is printed. Otherwise, `n-1` is printed.***
