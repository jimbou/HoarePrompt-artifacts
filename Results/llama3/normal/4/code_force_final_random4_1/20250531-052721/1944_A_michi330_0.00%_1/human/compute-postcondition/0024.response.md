Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^3), stdin contains 0 lines, `i` is equal to `t`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 0 and n*(n-1)/2 inclusive, `n` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, `k` is assigned the value of the second integer from the input. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, the number 1 is printed. Otherwise, `n-1` is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations means that the loop has finished executing and the program has terminated. The value of `t` remains unchanged, stdin is empty, `i` is equal to `t`, and `n` and `k` are assigned the values of the last integers from the input. The program prints either 1 or `n-1` depending on the value of `k`.
