Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 0 and n*(n-1)/2 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n <= 100, 0 <= k <= n*(n-1)/2). The current value of `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`.**
