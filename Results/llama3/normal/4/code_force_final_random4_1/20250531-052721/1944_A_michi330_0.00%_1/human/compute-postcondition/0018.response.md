Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 0 and n*(n-1)/2 inclusive, `n` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, `k` is assigned the value of the second integer from the input, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n <= 100, 0 <= k <= n*(n-1)/2).**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the first and second integers from the input, respectively. The stdin now contains `t-3` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, as one line has been consumed by the `input()` function.
