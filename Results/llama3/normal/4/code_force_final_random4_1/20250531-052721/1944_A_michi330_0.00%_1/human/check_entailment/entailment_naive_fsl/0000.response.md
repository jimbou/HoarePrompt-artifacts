Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when k is less than n - 1. In this case, the program prints n - 1, but the correct output should be n. This is because even if Dominater destroys k bridges, Everule can still visit all n islands by taking a different path.

For example, if n = 4 and k = 1, the program prints 3, but the correct output should be 4. This is because even if Dominater destroys one bridge, Everule can still visit all 4 islands by taking a different path.

The correct program should print n when k is less than n - 1, because Everule can always visit all n islands by taking a different path.
