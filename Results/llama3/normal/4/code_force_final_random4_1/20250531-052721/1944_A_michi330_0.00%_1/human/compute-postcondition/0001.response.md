According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^3) does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is at least 1 and i is now 0. 
State: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, stdin contains t lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n <= 100, 0 <= k <= n*(n-1)/2)**
