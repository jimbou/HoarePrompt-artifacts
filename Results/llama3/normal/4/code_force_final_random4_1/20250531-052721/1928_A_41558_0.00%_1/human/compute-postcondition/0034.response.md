Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) representing the size of Bob's rectangle, stdin contains multiple lines of input, where the first three lines have been read. If both `a` and `b` are odd, 'NO' is printed. If `a` is twice `b` or `b` is twice `a`, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.***
