Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether a rectangle can be cut into two identical smaller rectangles based on its dimensions. The program reads multiple lines of input from stdin, where the first line contains the number of test cases, and each subsequent line contains two integers representing the dimensions of the rectangle.

The program then checks the following conditions:

1. If both dimensions are odd numbers, it prints 'NO' because it is not possible to cut the rectangle into two identical smaller rectangles.
2. If one dimension is twice the other, it prints 'NO' because cutting the rectangle in half would result in two identical smaller rectangles, but the problem statement considers these as the same rectangle.
3. If neither of the above conditions is true, it prints 'YES' because it is possible to cut the rectangle into two identical smaller rectangles.

The program's logic is correct, and it covers all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
