Reasoning:
The given program is correct because it accurately implements the logic to determine if a rectangle can be cut into two identical smaller rectangles based on its dimensions. The program correctly handles the cases where both dimensions are odd or one dimension is twice the other, which are the conditions under which a rectangle cannot be cut into two identical smaller rectangles. The program also correctly prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on these conditions.

Correctness: **True**
