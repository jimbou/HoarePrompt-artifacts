Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) representing the size of Bob's rectangle, stdin contains multiple lines of input, where the first three lines have been read.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `b` are updated to the new values read from the input, which are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) representing the size of Bob's rectangle. The stdin now contains multiple lines of input, where the first three lines have been read.
