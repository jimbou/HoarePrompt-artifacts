Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) representing the size of Bob's rectangle, stdin contains multiple lines of input, where the first line has been read and the remaining lines contain two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9) representing the size of Bob's rectangle, except the first line which has been read. If a is half of b or b is half of a, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.***
