Output: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input, where the first line has been read and the remaining lines contain two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9) representing the size of Bob's rectangle, except the first line which has been read. Either `a` is even or `b` is even or both are even. Additionally, neither `a` is twice `b` nor `b` is twice `a`, and 'YES' is printed**
