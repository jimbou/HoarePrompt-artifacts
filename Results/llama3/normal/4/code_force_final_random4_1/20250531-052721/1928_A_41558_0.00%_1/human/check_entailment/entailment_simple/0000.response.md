Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. If both `a` and `b` are odd numbers, it's not possible to form another rectangle by cutting the original rectangle into two rectangles with integer sides. This is because the sum of two odd numbers is always even, and the difference between two odd numbers is always even. Therefore, the program correctly prints 'NO' in this case.

2. If either `a` or `b` is even, or both are even, then it's possible to form another rectangle by cutting the original rectangle into two rectangles with integer sides. However, if `a` is twice `b` or `b` is twice `a`, then the two resulting rectangles will be the same, and it's not possible to form another rectangle. The program correctly prints 'NO' in this case.

3. In all other cases, it's possible to form another rectangle by cutting the original rectangle into two rectangles with integer sides. The program correctly prints 'YES' in this case.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle.

Correctness: **True**
