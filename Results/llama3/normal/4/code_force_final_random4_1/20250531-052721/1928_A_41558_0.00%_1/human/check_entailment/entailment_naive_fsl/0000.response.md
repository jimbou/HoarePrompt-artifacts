Correctness: **True**

The program correctly determines whether Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle. It checks two conditions:

1. If both `a` and `b` are odd, it prints "NO" because the rectangle cannot be cut into two rectangles with integer sides.
2. If `a` is twice `b` or vice versa, it prints "NO" because the resulting rectangles would be the same as the original rectangle.

In all other cases, it prints "YES" because the rectangle can be cut into two rectangles with integer sides, and these rectangles can be rearranged to form a different rectangle.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the examples provided in the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
