The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) representing the size of Bob's rectangle, stdin contains multiple lines of input, where the first two lines have been read and the remaining lines contain two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9) representing the size of Bob's rectangle. If both `a` and `b` are odd, 'NO' is printed. If `a` is half of `b` or `b` is half of `a`, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.**
