Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input, where the first line has been read and the remaining lines contain two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9) representing the size of Bob's rectangle, except the first line which has been read.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `b` are updated to be integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), which are read from the second line of the input. The stdin still contains multiple lines of input, but the first line has been read and is no longer available.
