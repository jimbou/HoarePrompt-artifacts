The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple lines of input, where the first line has been read and the remaining lines contain two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9) representing the size of Bob's rectangle, except the first line which has been read. If both `a` and `b` are odd numbers, 'NO' is printed. If either `a` is even or `b` is even or both are even, then if `a` is twice `b` or `b` is twice `a`, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.**
