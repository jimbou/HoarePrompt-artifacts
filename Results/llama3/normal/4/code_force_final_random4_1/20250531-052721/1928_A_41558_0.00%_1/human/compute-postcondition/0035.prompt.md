Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple lines of input, where the first line has been read and the remaining lines contain two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9) representing the size of Bob's rectangle.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
        print('NO')
    elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input, where the first line has been read and the remaining lines contain two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9) representing the size of Bob's rectangle, except the first line which has been read. If both `a` and `b` are odd numbers, 'NO' is printed. If either `a` is even or `b` is even or both are even, then if `a` is twice `b` or `b` is twice `a`, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) representing the size of Bob's rectangle, stdin contains multiple lines of input, where the first line has been read and the remaining lines contain two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9) representing the size of Bob's rectangle, except the first line which has been read. If both `a` and `b` are odd, 'NO' is printed. If `a` is half of `b` or `b` is half of `a`, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) representing the size of Bob's rectangle, stdin contains multiple lines of input, where the first three lines have been read. If both `a` and `b` are odd, 'NO' is printed. If `a` is twice `b` or `b` is twice `a`, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
