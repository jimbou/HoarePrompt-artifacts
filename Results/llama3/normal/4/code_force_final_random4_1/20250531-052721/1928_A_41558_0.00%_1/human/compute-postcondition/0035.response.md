Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is `n`, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) representing the size of Bob's rectangle, stdin contains multiple lines of input, where the first `n` lines have been read and the remaining lines contain two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9) representing the size of Bob's rectangle. If both `a` and `b` are odd numbers, 'NO' is printed. If either `a` is even or `b` is even or both are even, then if `a` is twice `b` or `b` is twice `a`, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has processed all the input lines, and the values of `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from the input. The loop has printed 'NO' or 'YES' for each pair of integers based on the conditions specified in the loop body. The value of `i` is equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has executed `n` times. The state of the other variables in the precondition, such as `n` being an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), remains unchanged.
