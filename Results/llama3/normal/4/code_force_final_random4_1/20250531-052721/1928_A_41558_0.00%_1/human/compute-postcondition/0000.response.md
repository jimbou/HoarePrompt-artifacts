The code `n = int(input())` accepts an input and converts it to an integer. The stdin contains multiple lines of input, where the first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) representing the number of test cases. This integer is assigned to n. The remaining lines in stdin contain two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9) representing the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple lines of input, where the first line has been read and the remaining lines contain two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9) representing the size of Bob's rectangle.**
