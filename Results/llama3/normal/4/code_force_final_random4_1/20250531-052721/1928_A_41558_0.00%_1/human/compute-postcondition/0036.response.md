Functionality: **Determines whether a rectangle can be cut into two identical smaller rectangles based on its dimensions. The function reads multiple lines of input from stdin, where the first line contains the number of test cases, and each subsequent line contains two integers representing the dimensions of the rectangle. It then prints 'YES' if the rectangle can be cut into two identical smaller rectangles and 'NO' otherwise, considering the cases where both dimensions are odd or one dimension is twice the other.**
