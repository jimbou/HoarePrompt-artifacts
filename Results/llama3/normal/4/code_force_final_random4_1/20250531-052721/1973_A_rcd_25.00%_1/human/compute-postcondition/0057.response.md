Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer that must be at least 2, p1, p2, and p3 are integers where 0 <= p1 <= p2 <= p3 <= 30, low is an integer equal to the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, high is an integer greater than or equal to cur + 1, if the difference between p1 and cur is less than or equal to the difference between p2 and the difference between p3 and cur, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and p1 - cur + p3 is printed. Otherwise, cur is incremented by 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.***
