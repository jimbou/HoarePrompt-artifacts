Output State: **t is a positive integer that must be at least 2, p1, p2, and p3 are integers where 0 <= p1 <= p2 <= p3 <= 30, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases, low is the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, high is the maximum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2. Either p1 - cur + p3 has been printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or cur is equal to high + 1 and p3 has been printed.**

This output state indicates that the loop has finished executing all its iterations. The loop either terminated early by printing `p1 - cur + p3` and breaking out of the loop, or it completed all iterations, incrementing `cur` until it exceeded `high`, at which point it printed `p3`. The values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `_`, `low`, and `high` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop.
