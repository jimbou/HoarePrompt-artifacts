Output State: **t is a positive integer that must be at least 1, p1, p2, and p3 are integers where 0 <= p1 <= p2 <= p3 <= 30, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases. The sum of p1, p2, and p3 is an even number. p3 is less than p1 + p2, low is an integer equal to the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, high is an integer equal to the maximum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2 and high must be greater than or equal to cur. If p1 - cur is less than or equal to p2 - (p3 - cur), then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, cur is increased by 1 and is equal to high.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations means that the loop will continue to execute until the condition `high >= cur` is no longer true. This means that `cur` will be incremented until it is equal to `high`. If at any point during the loop execution, the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is true, the loop will break out and print `p1 - cur + p3`. Otherwise, the loop will continue to increment `cur` until it reaches `high`.
