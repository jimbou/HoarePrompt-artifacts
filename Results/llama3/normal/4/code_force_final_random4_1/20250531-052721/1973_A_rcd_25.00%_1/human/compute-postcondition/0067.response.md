Output State: **`t` is a positive integer that must be at least 2, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers where 0 <= `p1` <= `p2` <= `p3` <= 30, `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_` remain unchanged. The values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are updated to the integers read from the input, which are within the range 0 to 30 and are in non-decreasing order. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus four test cases.
