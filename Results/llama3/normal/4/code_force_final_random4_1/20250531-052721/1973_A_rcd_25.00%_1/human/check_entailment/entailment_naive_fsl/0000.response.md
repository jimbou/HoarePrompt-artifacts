Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when p1 + p2 + p3 is even but the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games and results. For example, if p1 = 0, p2 = 2, and p3 = 2, the program will print 2, but this is not a valid solution because it is not possible for two players to have the same score if one of them has not played any games.

In this case, the program should print -1, but it does not. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
