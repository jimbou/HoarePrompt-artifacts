To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to examine the condition `high >= cur` and adjust the states of `high` and `cur` accordingly.

Given that `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, we know that `low` is less than or equal to `high`.

Since `cur` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, we can conclude that `cur` is equal to `low`.

For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `high >= cur` must be true. Since `cur` is equal to `low`, we need to ensure that `high` is greater than or equal to `low`.

However, we already know that `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. Therefore, `high` is always greater than or equal to `low`.

In this case, no adjustments are needed to the states of `high` and `cur` to ensure the loop can execute the first time.

State: **t is a positive integer that must be at least 2, p1, p2, and p3 are integers where 0 <= p1 <= p2 <= p3 <= 30, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases, low is the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, high is the maximum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, cur is the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2**
