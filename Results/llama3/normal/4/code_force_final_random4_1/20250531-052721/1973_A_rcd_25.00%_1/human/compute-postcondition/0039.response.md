The code snippet `continue` skips the rest of the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration of the loop. In this case, since there are no changes to the variables `t`, `p1`, `p2`, or `p3`, their values remain the same. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, and -1 is still being printed.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer that must be at least 2, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers where 0 <= `p1` <= `p2` <= `p3` <= 30, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, and -1 is being printed, and we move on to the next iteration of the loop.**
