Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer that must be at least 2, p1, p2, and p3 are integers where 0 <= p1 <= p2 <= p3 <= 30, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases, low is the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, high is the maximum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2. If p1 - cur is less than or equal to p2 - (p3 - cur), then p1 - cur + p3 is printed and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, cur is less than or equal to high.***
