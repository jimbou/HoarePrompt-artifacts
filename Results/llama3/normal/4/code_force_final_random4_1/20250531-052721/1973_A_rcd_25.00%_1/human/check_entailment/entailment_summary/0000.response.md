Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly handles the different cases as described in the problem description.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1.  If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, it prints -1. This is because the sum of scores must be even, as each game contributes either 2 points (win or loss) or 1 point (draw) to the total score.

2.  If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, it prints the sum of `p1` and `p2`. This is because in this case, the maximum possible number of draws is achieved when `p1` and `p2` play against each other, resulting in `p1` and `p2` draws.

3.  Otherwise, it performs a binary search-like operation to find the maximum possible value that can be obtained by subtracting a certain value from `p1` and adding `p3`. This is because the maximum possible number of draws is achieved when `p1` and `p2` play against each other, and `p3` plays against the winner of each game.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the maximum possible number of draws or -1 if the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games and results.

Correctness: **True**
