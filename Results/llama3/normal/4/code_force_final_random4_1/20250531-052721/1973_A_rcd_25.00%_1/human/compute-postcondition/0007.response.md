Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer that must be at least 1, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers where 0 <= `p1` <= `p2` <= `p3` <= 30, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases. If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is an odd number, we skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Otherwise, the code continues to execute.***
