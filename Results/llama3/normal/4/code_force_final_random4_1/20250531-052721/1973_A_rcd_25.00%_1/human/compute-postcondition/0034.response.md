Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer that must be at least 1, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers where 0 <= `p1` <= `p2` <= `p3` <= 30, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases. If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is an odd number, the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop is skipped and moves to the next iteration. If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is an even number, then if `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the sum of `p1` and `p2` is printed. If `p3` is less than `p1` + `p2`, then low is the minimum of `p3` - `p1` and `p3` - `p2`, high is the maximum of `p3` - `p1` and `p3` - `p2` and high must be greater than or equal to cur. If `p1` - cur is less than or equal to `p2` - (`p3` - cur), then the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, cur is increased by 1 and is equal to high.***
