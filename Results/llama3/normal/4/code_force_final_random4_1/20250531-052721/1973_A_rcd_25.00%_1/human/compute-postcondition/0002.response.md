Output State: **`t` is a positive integer that must be at least 1, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers where 0 <= `p1` <= `p2` <= `p3` <= 30, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.**

In this output state, the values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are updated to be the three space-separated integers from the input, and the number of test cases in stdin is reduced by one. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the relationship between `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is maintained as specified in the initial state.
