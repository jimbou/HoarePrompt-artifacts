Postcondition: **t is a positive integer that must be at least 1, p1, p2, and p3 are integers where 0 <= p1 <= p2 <= p3 <= 30, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases. The sum of p1, p2, and p3 is an even number. p3 is less than p1 + p2, low is an integer equal to the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, high is an integer equal to the maximum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, cur is an integer equal to low. The current value of p1 minus cur is less than or equal to the current value of p2 minus the current value of p3 minus cur.**
