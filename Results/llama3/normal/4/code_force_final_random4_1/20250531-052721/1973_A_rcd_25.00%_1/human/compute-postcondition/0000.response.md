Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains three space-separated integers p_1, p_2 and p_3 (0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30).**

In this output state, `t` is assigned the value of the first test case from the input, which is a positive integer. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus one test case, since one test case has been read and assigned to `t`. The remaining test cases still contain three space-separated integers p_1, p_2 and p_3, with the constraints 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30.
