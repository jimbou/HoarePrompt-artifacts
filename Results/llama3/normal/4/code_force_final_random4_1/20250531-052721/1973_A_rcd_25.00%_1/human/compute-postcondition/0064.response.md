Output State: **t is a positive integer that must be at least 2, p1, p2, and p3 are integers where 0 <= p1 <= p2 <= p3 <= 30, low is an integer equal to the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, high is an integer greater than or equal to cur, if the difference between p1 and cur is less than or equal to the difference between p2 and the difference between p3 and cur, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and p1 - cur + p3 is printed. Otherwise, cur is incremented by 1 and equals to high, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations. The loop head and body have affected the values of `cur` and `high`. The value of `cur` has been incremented until it is equal to `high`, and the value of `high` has been updated to be greater than or equal to `cur`. The other variables in the precondition, such as `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `low`, remain unchanged. The program continues to process the remaining test cases in stdin, minus three test cases.
