Output State: **t is a positive integer that must be at least 1, p1, p2, and p3 are integers where 0 <= p1 <= p2 <= p3 <= 30, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases. The sum of p1, p2, and p3 is an even number. p3 is less than p1 + p2, low is an integer equal to the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, high is an integer equal to the maximum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, cur is an integer equal to low. The current value of p1 minus cur is less than or equal to the current value of p2 minus the current value of p3 minus cur, and this is printed: p1 - cur + p3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables t, p1, p2, p3, low, high, and cur remain the same, and the condition p1 - cur + p3 has been printed. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.
