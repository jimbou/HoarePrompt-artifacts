Based on the precondition, we can analyze the print statement as follows:

* `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers where `0 <= p1 <= p2 <= p3 <= 30`.
* The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is an even number.
* `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`.
* `low` is an integer equal to the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
* `high` is an integer equal to the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` and `high` must be greater than `cur`.

The print statement is `print(p1 - cur + p3)`.

Since `cur` is not explicitly defined in the precondition, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we can describe the output in terms of the given variables.

The output will be the result of subtracting `cur` from `p1` and then adding `p3`. Since `p1` and `p3` are integers, the result will also be an integer.

Output: **p1 - cur + p3 (where p1 is an integer between 0 and 30, cur is an unknown value, and p3 is an integer between 0 and 30)**
