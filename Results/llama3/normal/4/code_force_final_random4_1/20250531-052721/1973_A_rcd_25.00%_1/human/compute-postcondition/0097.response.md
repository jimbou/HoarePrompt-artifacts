Output State: **`t` is a positive integer that must be at least 0, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers where 0 <= `p1` <= `p2` <= `p3` <= 30, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `t` test cases. If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, -1 is printed and we move on to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the sum of `p1` and `p2` is printed. Otherwise, the program continues with the next operation. If the difference between `p1` and `cur` is less than or equal to the difference between `p2` and the difference between `p3` and `cur`, then `p1 - cur + p3` is printed. Otherwise, `cur` is incremented by 1 and equals to `high`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations means that the loop has finished executing and the program has processed all the test cases. The value of `t` is now 0, indicating that there are no more test cases to process. The values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are still integers within the range 0 to 30, but they are no longer relevant as the loop has finished. The stdin contains multiple test cases minus `t` test cases, which means that all test cases have been processed and there are no more inputs to read. The program has printed the results for each test case, either -1 if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, the sum of `p1` and `p2` if `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, or `p1 - cur + p3` if the difference between `p1` and `cur` is less than or equal to the difference between `p2` and the difference between `p3` and `cur`.
