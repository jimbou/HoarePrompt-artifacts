Output State: **`t` is a positive integer that must be at least 1, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers where 0 <= `p1` <= `p2` <= `p3` <= 30, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is an odd number, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, and we skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but we skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration, because the `continue` statement is used. The values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain the same, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.
