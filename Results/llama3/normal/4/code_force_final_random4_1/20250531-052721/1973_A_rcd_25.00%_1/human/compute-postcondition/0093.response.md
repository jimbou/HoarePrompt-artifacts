Output State: **`t` is a positive integer that must be at least 2, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers where 0 <= `p1` <= `p2` <= `p3` <= 30, `_` is 1, `cur` is less than or equal to `high`, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `cur` has been incremented by 1, but it is still less than or equal to `high`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus four test cases.
