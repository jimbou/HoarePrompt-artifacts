Output State: **`t` is a positive integer that must be at least 1, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers where 0 <= `p1` <= `p2` <= `p3` <= 30, `low` is an integer equal to the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is an integer equal to the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `cur` is an integer equal to `low + 1`, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is an even number, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, and `p1 - cur` is more than `p2 - (p3 - cur)`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` is still a positive integer at least 1, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are still integers between 0 and 30 inclusive, `low` and `high` are still the minimum and maximum differences between `p3` and `p1` or `p2`, `cur` has been incremented by 1, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is still even, `p3` is still less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`, and the inequality between `p1 - cur` and `p2 - (p3 - cur)` still holds. The number of test cases in stdin has not changed.
