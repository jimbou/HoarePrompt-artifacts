To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `high >= cur` and adjust the states of `high` and `cur` accordingly, as they are the variables in the loop head.

Given that `low` is an integer equal to the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `high` is an integer equal to the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, we know that `low` is less than or equal to `high`. Additionally, `cur` is an integer equal to `low`.

For the loop to execute the first time, `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur`. Since `cur` is equal to `low`, we need to ensure that `high` is greater than or equal to `low`. This is already guaranteed by the definitions of `low` and `high`, as `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `low` is the minimum of the same two values.

Therefore, no additional adjustments are needed to the states of `high` and `cur` for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **t is a positive integer that must be at least 1, p1, p2, and p3 are integers where 0 <= p1 <= p2 <= p3 <= 30, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases. The sum of p1, p2, and p3 is an even number. p3 is less than p1 + p2, low is an integer equal to the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, high is an integer equal to the maximum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, cur is an integer equal to low**
