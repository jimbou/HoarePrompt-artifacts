The code prints the value of `p1` minus `cur` plus `p3`. 

`p1` is an integer where 0 <= p1 <= p2 <= p3 <= 30, `cur` is less than `high` where `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `p3` is an integer where 0 <= p1 <= p2 <= p3 <= 30.

Since the exact values of `p1`, `cur`, and `p3` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `p1 - cur + p3`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value.

Output: **p1 - cur + p3 (where p1 is an integer between 0 and 30, cur is less than the maximum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, and p3 is an integer between 0 and 30)**
