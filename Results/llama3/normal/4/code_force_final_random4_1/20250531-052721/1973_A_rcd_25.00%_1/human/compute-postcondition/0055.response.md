Output State: **`t` is a positive integer that must be at least 2, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers where 0 <= `p1` <= `p2` <= `p3` <= 30, `low` is an integer equal to the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is an integer greater than or equal to `cur + 1`, `cur` is incremented by 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, and `p1 - cur + p3` is printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains the same, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are still within the range of 0 to 30, `low` is still the minimum difference between `p3` and `p1` or `p2`, `high` is still greater than or equal to `cur + 1`, but `cur` is incremented by 1. We also break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Additionally, the program has processed three test cases and printed the value of `p1 - cur + p3`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus three.
