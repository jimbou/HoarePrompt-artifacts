Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer that must be at least 2, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers where 0 <= `p1` <= `p2` <= `p3` <= 30, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases. If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, -1 is printed and we move on to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the sum of `p1` and `p2` is printed. Otherwise, the program continues with the next operation. If the difference between `p1` and `cur` is less than or equal to the difference between `p2` and the difference between `p3` and `cur`, then `p1 - cur + p3` is printed. Otherwise, `cur` is incremented by 1 and equals to `high`.***
