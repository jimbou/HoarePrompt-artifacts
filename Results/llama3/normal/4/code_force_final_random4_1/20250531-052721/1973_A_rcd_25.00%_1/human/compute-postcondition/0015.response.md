The code prints the sum of p1 and p3 minus cur. Where p1 is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive, p3 is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive and is less than p1 + p2, and cur is an integer equal to the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2.
Output: **p1 + p3 - cur (where p1 is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive, p3 is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive and is less than p1 + p2, and cur is an integer equal to the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2)**
