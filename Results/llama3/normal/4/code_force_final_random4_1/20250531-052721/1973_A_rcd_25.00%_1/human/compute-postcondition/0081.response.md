Output State: **t is a positive integer that must be at least 2, p1, p2, and p3 are integers where 0 <= p1 <= p2 <= p3 <= 30, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases, low is the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, high is the maximum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, cur is the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2 + 1, and p1 - cur is more than p2 - (p3 - cur - 1)**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of cur has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between p1, p2, and cur has been updated to reflect the new value of cur.
