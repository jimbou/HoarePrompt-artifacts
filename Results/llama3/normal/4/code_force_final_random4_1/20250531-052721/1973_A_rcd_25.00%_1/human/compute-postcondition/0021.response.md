The only variable in the loop head is variable high and cur, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable high and cur.  If high is greater than or equal to cur, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, high is an integer equal to the maximum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, and cur is incremented by 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time high must be greater than cur.
State: **t is a positive integer that must be at least 1, p1, p2, and p3 are integers where 0 <= p1 <= p2 <= p3 <= 30, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases. The sum of p1, p2, and p3 is an even number. p3 is less than p1 + p2, low is an integer equal to the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, high is an integer equal to the maximum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2 and high must be greater than cur.**
