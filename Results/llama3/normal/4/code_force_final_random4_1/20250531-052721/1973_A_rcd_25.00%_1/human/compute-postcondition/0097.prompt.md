Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains three space-separated integers p_1, p_2 and p_3 (0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())
    if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
        print(-1)
        continue
    if p3 >= p1 + p2:
        print(p1 + p2)
    else:
        low, high = min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2), max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)
        cur = low
        while high >= cur:
            if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur):
                print(p1 - cur + p3)
                break
            else:
                cur += 1
        else:
            print(p3)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer that must be at least 1, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers where 0 <= `p1` <= `p2` <= `p3` <= 30, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases. If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is an odd number, the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop is skipped and moves to the next iteration. If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is an even number, then if `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the sum of `p1` and `p2` is printed. If `p3` is less than `p1` + `p2`, then low is the minimum of `p3` - `p1` and `p3` - `p2`, high is the maximum of `p3` - `p1` and `p3` - `p2` and high must be greater than or equal to cur. If `p1` - cur is less than or equal to `p2` - (`p3` - cur), then the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, cur is increased by 1 and is equal to high.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer that must be at least 2, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers where 0 <= `p1` <= `p2` <= `p3` <= 30, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases. If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, -1 is printed and we move on to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the sum of `p1` and `p2` is printed. Otherwise, the program continues with the next operation. If the difference between `p1` and `cur` is less than or equal to the difference between `p2` and the difference between `p3` and `cur`, then `p1 - cur + p3` is printed. Otherwise, `cur` is incremented by 1 and equals to `high`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer that must be at least 2, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers where 0 <= `p1` <= `p2` <= `p3` <= 30, `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases. If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, the program prints -1 and skips to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the sum of `p1` and `p2` is printed. Otherwise, low is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, high is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. Either `p1 - cur + p3` has been printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or `cur` is equal to `high + 1` and `p3` has been printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
