To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `high >= cur`. Since `cur` is equal to `low`, we need to ensure that `high` is greater than or equal to `low`.

From the given state, we know that `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. Since `low` is the minimum, it is already less than or equal to `high`.

However, we need to ensure that `high` is not equal to `low`, because if they are equal, the loop condition `high >= cur` would not be true. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `high` to be greater than `low`.

State: **t is a positive integer that must be at least 2, p1, p2, and p3 are integers where 0 <= p1 <= p2 <= p3 <= 30, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, low is an integer equal to the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, high is an integer greater than low, cur is an integer equal to low**
