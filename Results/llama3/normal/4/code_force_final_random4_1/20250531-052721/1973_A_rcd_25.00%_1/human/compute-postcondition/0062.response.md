Output State: **`t` is a positive integer that must be at least 2, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers where 0 <= `p1` <= `p2` <= `p3` <= 30, `low` is an integer equal to the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is greater than or equal to `cur + 1`, `cur` is less than or equal to `high - 1` and is incremented by 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cur` is incremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The conditions on `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, and `high` are still valid. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.
