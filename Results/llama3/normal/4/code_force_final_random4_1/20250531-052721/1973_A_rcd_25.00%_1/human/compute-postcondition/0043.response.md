Output State: **t is a positive integer that must be at least 2, p1, p2, and p3 are integers where 0 <= p1 <= p2 <= p3 <= 30, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, low is an integer equal to the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, high is an integer equal to the maximum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, cur is an integer equal to low.**

The code assigns the minimum and maximum values of the differences between `p3` and `p1` and between `p3` and `p2` to `low` and `high`, respectively. Then, it assigns the value of `low` to `cur`. The values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The state of `stdin` also remains the same, as the code does not interact with it.
