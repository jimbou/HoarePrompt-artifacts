The code prints the sum of `p1` minus `cur` and `p3`. Where `p1` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive, `cur` is an integer that is incremented by 1 until the difference between `p1` and `cur` is less than or equal to the difference between `p2` and the difference between `p3` and `cur`, and `p3` is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive.
Output: **p1 - cur + p3 (where p1 is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive, cur is an integer that is incremented by 1 until the difference between p1 and cur is less than or equal to the difference between p2 and the difference between p3 and cur, and p3 is an integer between 0 and 30 inclusive)**
