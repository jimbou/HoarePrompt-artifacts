Output: **`t` is a positive integer that must be at least 1, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers where 0 <= `p1` <= `p2` <= `p3` <= 30, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is an even number. The current value of `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, and the sum of `p1` and `p2` is being printed**
