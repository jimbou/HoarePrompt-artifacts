The value of `cur` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cur` is less than `high` which is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer that must be at least 1, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers where 0 <= `p1` <= `p2` <= `p3` <= 30, `cur` is increased by 1 and is less than or equal to `high` which is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `low` is an integer equal to the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is an even number, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.
