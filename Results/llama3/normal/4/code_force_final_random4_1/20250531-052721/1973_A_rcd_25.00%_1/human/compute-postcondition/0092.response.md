Output State: **t is a positive integer that must be at least 2, p1, p2, and p3 are integers where 0 <= p1 <= p2 <= p3 <= 30, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases, low is the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, high is the maximum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, and cur is less than high, and this is printed: p1 - cur + p3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables t, p1, p2, p3, _, low, high, and cur remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus four test cases. The expression p1 - cur + p3 has been printed. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
