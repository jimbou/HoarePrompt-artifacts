The code prints the value of `p1 - cur + p3`, where `p1` is an integer between 0 and 30, `cur` is less than the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `p3` is an integer between 0 and 30.
Output: **t is a positive integer that must be at least 2, p1, p2, and p3 are integers where 0 <= p1 <= p2 <= p3 <= 30, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases, low is the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, high is the maximum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, and cur is less than high, and this is printed: p1 - cur + p3**
