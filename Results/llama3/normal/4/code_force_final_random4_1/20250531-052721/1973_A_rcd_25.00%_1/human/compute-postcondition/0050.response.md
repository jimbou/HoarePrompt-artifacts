Output State: **`t` is a positive integer that must be at least 2, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers where 0 <= `p1` <= `p2` <= `p3` <= 30, `low` is an integer equal to the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is an integer greater than `low`, `cur` is an integer equal to `low + 1`, and `p1 - cur` is greater than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `cur` has been incremented by 1, making it equal to `low + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, and `high` are still valid. The relationship between `p1 - cur` and `p2 - (p3 - cur)` has also been updated to reflect the new value of `cur`.
