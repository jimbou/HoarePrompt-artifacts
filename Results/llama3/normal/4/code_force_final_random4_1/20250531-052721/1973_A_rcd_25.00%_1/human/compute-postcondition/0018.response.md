Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer that must be at least 1, p1, p2, and p3 are integers where 0 <= p1 <= p2 <= p3 <= 30, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases. The sum of p1, p2, and p3 is an even number. p3 is less than p1 + p2, low is an integer equal to the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, high is an integer equal to the maximum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, cur is an integer equal to low. Additionally, p1 - cur is more than p2 - (p3 - cur).***
