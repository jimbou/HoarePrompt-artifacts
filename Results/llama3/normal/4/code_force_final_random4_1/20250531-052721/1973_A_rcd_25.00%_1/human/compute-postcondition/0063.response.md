Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer that must be at least 2, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers where 0 <= `p1` <= `p2` <= `p3` <= 30, `low` is an integer equal to the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is greater than or equal to `cur + 1`. If `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` is incremented by 1. The program continues to process the remaining test cases in stdin, minus three test cases.***
