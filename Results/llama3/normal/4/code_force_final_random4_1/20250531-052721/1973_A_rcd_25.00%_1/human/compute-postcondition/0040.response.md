Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer that must be at least 2, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers where 0 <= `p1` <= `p2` <= `p3` <= 30, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases. If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, -1 is printed and we move on to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues with the next operation.***
