Output State: **t is a positive integer that must be at least 2, p1, p2, and p3 are integers where 0 <= p1 <= p2 <= p3 <= 30, low is an integer equal to the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, high is an integer greater than or equal to cur + 2, cur is incremented by 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of cur has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of high is now greater than or equal to the new value of cur plus 1. The rest of the conditions and variable values remain the same as in the initial state.
