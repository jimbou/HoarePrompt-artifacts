According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `high` and `cur`. If `high` is greater than or equal to `cur`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `cur` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` + 1. `cur` being the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` + 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `cur` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` + 1 and `cur` is less than or equal to `high`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **t is a positive integer that must be at least 2, p1, p2, and p3 are integers where 0 <= p1 <= p2 <= p3 <= 30, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases, low is the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, high is the maximum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, cur is the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2 + 1 and cur is less than or equal to high**
