Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of draws that could have happened in a series of chess games between three friends. The program handles all possible cases, including when the sum of the scores is odd, when p3 is greater than or equal to the sum of p1 and p2, and when p3 is less than the sum of p1 and p2.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly calculates the maximum possible number of draws in each case. The use of a binary search-like operation to find the maximum possible value that can be obtained by subtracting a certain value from p1 and adding p3 is efficient and effective.

The program also correctly handles the case when no valid set of games and results can produce the given scores, in which case it prints -1.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
