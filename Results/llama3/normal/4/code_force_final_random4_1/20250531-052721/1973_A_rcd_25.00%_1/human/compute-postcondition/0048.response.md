Output State: **`t` is a positive integer that must be at least 2, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers where 0 <= `p1` <= `p2` <= `p3` <= 30, `low` is an integer equal to the minimum of `p3` - `p1` and `p3` - `p2`, `high` is an integer greater than `low`, `cur` is an integer equal to `low`, and the difference between `p1` and `cur` is less than or equal to the difference between `p2` and the difference between `p3` and `cur`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, `high`, and `cur` remain the same, and the condition `p1 - cur + p3` has been printed. The only change is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
