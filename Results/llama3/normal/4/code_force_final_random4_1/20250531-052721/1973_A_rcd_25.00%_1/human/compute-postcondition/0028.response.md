The code prints the value of the expression `p1 - cur + p3`. Based on the precondition, we can describe the values of the variables involved in this expression.

`p1` is an integer where `0 <= p1 <= 30`, and `p3` is also an integer where `0 <= p3 <= 30`. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is an even number, but this information does not directly affect the value of the expression.

`cur` is an integer that is less than `high`, and `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. Since `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, we can infer that `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` are both non-negative.

Given these constraints, the value of `p1 - cur + p3` will be an integer that depends on the specific values of `p1`, `cur`, and `p3`. However, we can express the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **p1 - cur + p3 (where p1 is an integer between 0 and 30, cur is an integer less than the maximum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, and p3 is an integer between 0 and 30)**
