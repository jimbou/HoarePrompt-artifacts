The code prints the value of the expression `p1 - cur + p3`, where `p1`, `cur`, and `p3` are integers. 

`p1` is an integer between 0 and 30 (inclusive), `cur` is an integer less than or equal to `high - 1`, and `p3` is an integer between 0 and 30 (inclusive). 

The value of `p1 - cur + p3` depends on the specific values of `p1`, `cur`, and `p3`. Since the exact values of these variables are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expression.

However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the result of the expression `p1 - cur + p3`, which is an integer.

Output: **p1 - cur + p3 (where p1 is an integer between 0 and 30, cur is an integer less than or equal to high - 1, and p3 is an integer between 0 and 30)**
