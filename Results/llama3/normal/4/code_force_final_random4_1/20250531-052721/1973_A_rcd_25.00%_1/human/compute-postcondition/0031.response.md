Output State: **t is a positive integer that must be at least 1, p1, p2, and p3 are integers where 0 <= p1 <= p2 <= p3 <= 30, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases. The sum of p1, p2, and p3 is an even number. p3 is less than p1 + p2, low is an integer equal to the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, high is an integer equal to the maximum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2 and high must be greater than cur and cur is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: t is still a positive integer at least 1, p1, p2, and p3 are still integers between 0 and 30 inclusive, and their sum is still even. p3 is still less than the sum of p1 and p2. The values of low and high are still the minimum and maximum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, respectively. However, the value of cur has been incremented by 1, so it is now one more than its previous value.
