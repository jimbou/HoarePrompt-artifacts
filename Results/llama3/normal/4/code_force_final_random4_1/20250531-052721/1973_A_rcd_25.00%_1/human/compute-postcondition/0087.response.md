Output State: **`t` is a positive integer that must be at least 2, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers where 0 <= `p1` <= `p2` <= `p3` <= 30, `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases, `low` is the minimum of `p3` - `p1` and `p3` - `p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3` - `p1` and `p3` - `p2`, `cur` is the minimum of `p3` - `p1` and `p3` - `p2` + 2 and `cur` is less than or equal to `high`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cur` has been incremented by 1, so it is now the minimum of `p3` - `p1` and `p3` - `p2` plus 2, and it is still less than or equal to `high`. All other variables remain unchanged.
