The only variable in the loop head is variable high and cur, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable high and cur.  If high is greater than or equal to cur, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, high is greater than or equal to cur + 1, So for the loop to be executed one more time high must be greater than or equal to cur + 1 and cur must be less than or equal to high - 1.
State: **t is a positive integer that must be at least 2, p1, p2, and p3 are integers where 0 <= p1 <= p2 <= p3 <= 30, low is an integer equal to the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, high is greater than or equal to cur + 1, cur must be less than or equal to high - 1, if the difference between p1 and cur is less than or equal to the difference between p2 and the difference between p3 and cur, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and p1 - cur + p3 is printed. Otherwise, cur is incremented by 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.**
