Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer that must be at least 2, p1, p2, and p3 are integers where 0 <= p1 <= p2 <= p3 <= 30, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, low is an integer equal to the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, high is an integer equal to the maximum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, cur is an integer equal to low.
Code of the loop:
while high >= cur:
    if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur):
        print(p1 - cur + p3)
        break
    else:
        cur += 1
else:
    print(p3)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is a positive integer that must be at least 2, p1, p2, and p3 are integers where 0 <= p1 <= p2 <= p3 <= 30, low is an integer equal to the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, high is an integer greater than low, if the difference between p1 and cur is less than or equal to the difference between p2 and the difference between p3 and cur, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise, cur is incremented by 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *t is a positive integer that must be at least 2, p1, p2, and p3 are integers where 0 <= p1 <= p2 <= p3 <= 30, low is an integer equal to the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, high is an integer greater than or equal to cur + 1, if the difference between p1 and cur is less than or equal to the difference between p2 and the difference between p3 and cur, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and p1 - cur + p3 is printed. Otherwise, cur is incremented by 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`t` is a positive integer that must be at least 2, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers where 0 <= `p1` <= `p2` <= `p3` <= 30, `low` is an integer equal to the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is greater than or equal to `cur + 1`. If `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` is incremented by 1. The program continues to process the remaining test cases in stdin, minus three test cases.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
