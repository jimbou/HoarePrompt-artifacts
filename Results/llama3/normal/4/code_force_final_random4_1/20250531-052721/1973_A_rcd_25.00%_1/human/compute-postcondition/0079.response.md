Output State: **`t` is a positive integer that must be at least 2, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers where 0 <= `p1` <= `p2` <= `p3` <= 30, `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases, `low` is the minimum of `p3` - `p1` and `p3` - `p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3` - `p1` and `p3` - `p2`, `cur` is the minimum of `p3` - `p1` and `p3` - `p2`, the current value of `p1` minus `cur` is less than or equal to `p2` minus the difference between `p3` and `cur`, the sum of `p1` minus `cur` and `p3` has been printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `_`, `low`, `high`, `cur` remain the same, and the condition `p1` minus `cur` is less than or equal to `p2` minus the difference between `p3` and `cur` still holds. The sum of `p1` minus `cur` and `p3` has been printed, and we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
