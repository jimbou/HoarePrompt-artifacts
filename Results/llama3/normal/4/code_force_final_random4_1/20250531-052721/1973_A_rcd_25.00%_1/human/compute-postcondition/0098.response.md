Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers p1, p2, and p3. It then processes each test case based on the following rules: If the sum of p1, p2, and p3 is odd, it prints -1 and moves on to the next test case. If p3 is greater than or equal to the sum of p1 and p2, it prints the sum of p1 and p2. Otherwise, it performs a binary search-like operation to find the maximum possible value that can be obtained by subtracting a certain value from p1 and adding p3, and prints this value. If no such value is found, it prints p3. The function continues this process until all test cases have been processed.**
