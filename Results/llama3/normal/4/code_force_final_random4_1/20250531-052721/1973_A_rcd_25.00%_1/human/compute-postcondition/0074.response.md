Output State: **t is a positive integer that must be at least 2, p1, p2, and p3 are integers where 0 <= p1 <= p2 <= p3 <= 30, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases, low is the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, high is the maximum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, cur is the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2.**

The code snippet calculates the minimum and maximum differences between p3 and p1, and p3 and p2, and assigns these values to low and high, respectively. It then assigns the minimum of these two differences to cur. The values of t, p1, p2, p3, and _ remain unchanged. The state of stdin is also unchanged, as no input operations are performed.
