Output State: **`t` is a positive integer that must be at least 2, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers where 0 <= `p1` <= `p2` <= `p3` <= 30, `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases, and -1 is being printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. The values of the variables `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `_` remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus four test cases. The `-1` is still being printed. The only change is that we move on to the next iteration of the loop, skipping the rest of the code inside the current iteration.
