The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `t` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again `_` must be 2 and `t` must be at least 2.
State: **`t` is a positive integer that must be at least 2, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers where 0 <= `p1` <= `p2` <= `p3` <= 30, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.**
