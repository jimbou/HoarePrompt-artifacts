Based on the given initial state, let's analyze the print statement:

`print(p1 - cur + p3)`

We know that:

* `cur` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`
* `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, which is equal to `cur`
* `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`
* `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`

Since `cur` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, we can rewrite the expression `p1 - cur` as `p1 - (p3 - p1)` or `p1 - (p3 - p2)`. Let's consider both cases:

1. `p1 - cur = p1 - (p3 - p1) = 2*p1 - p3`
2. `p1 - cur = p1 - (p3 - p2) = p1 - p3 + p2`

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print(p1 - cur + p3)`

Substituting the expressions for `p1 - cur` from above, we get:

1. `print(2*p1 - p3 + p3) = print(2*p1)`
2. `print(p1 - p3 + p2 + p3) = print(p1 + p2)`

Since `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`, we can conclude that `p1` is less than or equal to `p2`. Therefore, the correct expression is:

`print(p1 + p2)`

Output: **p1 + p2 (where p1 and p2 are integers between 0 and 30, inclusive)**
