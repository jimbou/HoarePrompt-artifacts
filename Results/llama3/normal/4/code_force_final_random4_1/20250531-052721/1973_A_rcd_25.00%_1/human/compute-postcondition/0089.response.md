The variables in the loop head are high and cur, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables high and cur. If high is greater than or equal to cur, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, high is the maximum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, and cur is less than or equal to high. For the loop to be executed one more time, cur must be less than high. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **t is a positive integer that must be at least 2, p1, p2, and p3 are integers where 0 <= p1 <= p2 <= p3 <= 30, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases, low is the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, high is the maximum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, and cur is less than high**
