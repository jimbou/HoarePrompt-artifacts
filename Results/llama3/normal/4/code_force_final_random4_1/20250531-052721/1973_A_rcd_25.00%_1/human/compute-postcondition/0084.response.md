The code prints the value of the expression `p1 - cur + p3`. 

`p1` is an integer where 0 <= p1 <= p2 <= p3 <= 30, `cur` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` + 1, and `p3` is an integer where 0 <= p1 <= p2 <= p3 <= 30.

Since `cur` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` + 1, it is at least 1 and at most `p3 - p1` or `p3 - p2` + 1.

Output: **p1 - the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2 + 1 + p3 (where p1, p3 are the values of p1, p3 respectively)**
