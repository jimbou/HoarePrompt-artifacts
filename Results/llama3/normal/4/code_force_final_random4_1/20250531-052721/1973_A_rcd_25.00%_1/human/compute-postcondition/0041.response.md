The code prints the sum of `p1` and `p2`, which are integers where 0 <= `p1` <= `p2` <= 30. Since the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even (as the program continues with the next operation), the sum of `p1` and `p2` will be an integer between 0 and 60.
Output: **p1 + p2 (where p1 and p2 are integers between 0 and 30)**
