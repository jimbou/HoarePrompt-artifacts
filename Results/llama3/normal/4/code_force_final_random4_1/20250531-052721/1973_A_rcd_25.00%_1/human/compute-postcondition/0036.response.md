Output State: **`t` is a positive integer that must be at least 2, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers where 0 <= `p1` <= `p2` <= `p3` <= 30, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.**

In this output state, the values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` have been updated to the values read from the input, which are integers between 0 and 30, inclusive, and are in non-decreasing order. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the stdin now contains one less test case.
