Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer that must be at least 2, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers where 0 <= `p1` <= `p2` <= `p3` <= 30, `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases. If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, the program prints -1 and skips to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the sum of `p1` and `p2` is printed. Otherwise, low is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, high is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. Either `p1 - cur + p3` has been printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or `cur` is equal to `high + 1` and `p3` has been printed.***
