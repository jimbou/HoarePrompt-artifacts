To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t` and the variable `_` (although `_` is a throwaway variable, its state is still relevant for the loop to execute). The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer that must be at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains three space-separated integers p_1, p_2 and p_3 (0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30), _ is 0**
