The code prints the sum of `p1` and `p3` minus `cur`. 

Since `cur` is equal to `low`, which is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, we can substitute `cur` with `low` in the expression. 

So, the expression becomes `p1 - (p3 - p1) + p3` or `p1 - (p3 - p2) + p3`. 

Simplifying the expression, we get `2*p1` or `p1 + p2`. 

However, since `p1` is less than or equal to `p2`, the difference between `p1` and `cur` is less than or equal to the difference between `p2` and the difference between `p3` and `cur`, `cur` is equal to `p3 - p1`. 

Therefore, the expression becomes `p1 - (p3 - p1) + p3`, which simplifies to `2*p1`. 

Output: **2*p1 (where p1 is the first integer)**
