Output State: **`t` is a positive integer that must be at least 2, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers where 0 <= `p1` <= `p2` <= `p3` <= 30, `low` is an integer equal to the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is greater than or equal to `cur + 1`, `cur` must be less than or equal to `high - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, `high`, and `cur` remain the same as in the initial state, but we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
