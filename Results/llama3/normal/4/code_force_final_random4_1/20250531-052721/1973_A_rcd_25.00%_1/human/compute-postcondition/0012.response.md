Output State: **t is a positive integer that must be at least 1, p1, p2, and p3 are integers where 0 <= p1 <= p2 <= p3 <= 30, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases. The sum of p1, p2, and p3 is an even number. p3 is less than p1 + p2, low is an integer equal to the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, high is an integer equal to the maximum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, cur is an integer equal to low.**

The code snippet assigns the minimum and maximum values of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` to `low` and `high`, respectively. Since `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, the minimum value will always be non-negative. The value of `cur` is then set to `low`, which is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. The values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged, as well as the state of stdin.
