Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[1]` and `b[1]`, stdin contains no input. If the absolute difference between `a[2]` and `b[-(n - 2)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[2]` and `b[2]`, then `temp` is set to 2. Otherwise, `temp` remains unchanged.***
