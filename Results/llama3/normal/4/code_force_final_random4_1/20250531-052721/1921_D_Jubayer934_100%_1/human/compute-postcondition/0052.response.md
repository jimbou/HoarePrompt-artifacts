The code prints the sum of the absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `b`, or the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at indices `temp` to `n-1` of `a` and the elements at indices `-(n-temp)` to `-1` of `b`, depending on the value of `temp`.

Output: **sum of absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `b`, or sum of absolute differences between elements at indices `temp` to `n-1` of `a` and elements at indices `-(n-temp)` to `-1` of `b`**
