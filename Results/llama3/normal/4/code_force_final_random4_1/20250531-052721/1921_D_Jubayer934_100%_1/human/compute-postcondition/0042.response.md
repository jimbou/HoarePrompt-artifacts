Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in ascending order, `i` is `n`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `b`, `temp` is either the index where the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, or remains unchanged if no such index is found, `stdin` is empty.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is as follows:

* The loop has iterated over all elements of list `a`, and the index `i` has reached the value of `n`.
* The list `ans` now contains the absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `b`.
* The variable `temp` has been updated to the index where the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, if such an index exists. Otherwise, `temp` remains unchanged.
* The state of the other variables, including `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `stdin`, remains unchanged.
