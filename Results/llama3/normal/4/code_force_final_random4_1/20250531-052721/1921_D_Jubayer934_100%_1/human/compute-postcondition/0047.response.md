Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in ascending order, `i` is `n+1`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `b` plus the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the last element of `b`, plus the absolute difference between the element at index `i` of `a` and the element at index `-(n-i)` of `b`, `temp` is `n`, and `stdin` is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables remain the same as in the initial state, except for the list `ans`, which now contains an additional element: the absolute difference between the element at index `i` of `a` and the element at index `-(n-i)` of `b`.
