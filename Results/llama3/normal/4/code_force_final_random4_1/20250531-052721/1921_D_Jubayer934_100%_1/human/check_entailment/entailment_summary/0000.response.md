Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the maximum total difference D that can be obtained by arranging the elements of list b in a certain order to make it as different as possible from list a.

The program first sorts both lists a and b in ascending order. Then, it iterates over the elements of list a and calculates the absolute difference between each element of a and the corresponding element of b. If the absolute difference between an element of a and the corresponding element of b in reverse order is greater than the absolute difference in the original order, it updates the elements of list ans with the absolute differences in reverse order.

Finally, the program prints the sum of the absolute differences in list ans, which represents the maximum total difference D that can be obtained.

Correctness: **True**
