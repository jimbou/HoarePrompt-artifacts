Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in ascending order, `i` is 1, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `b`, and the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `stdin` is empty. If the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, then `temp` is 1. Otherwise, `temp` remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to include the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, in addition to the initial absolute difference between the first elements of `a` and `b`. The other variables remain unchanged.
