Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `i` is less than `n`, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is -1, `stdin` is empty. The current value of the absolute difference between the element at index `i` in `a` and the element at index `n-i` from the end in `b` is greater than the absolute difference between the element at index `i` in `a` and the element at index `i` in `b`.***
