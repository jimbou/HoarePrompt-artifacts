Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of two integers `n` and `m`, followed by `n` integers `a_i` and `m` integers `b_i`.
2.  It sorts the lists `a` and `b` in ascending and descending order, respectively, which is necessary to find the maximum total difference `D`.
3.  The program then iterates over the sorted lists `a` and `b` and calculates the absolute difference between corresponding elements. If the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, it updates the `temp` variable and breaks the loop.
4.  If `temp` is not equal to -1, the program calculates the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` for the remaining elements and appends them to the `ans` list.
5.  Finally, the program prints the sum of the absolute differences in the `ans` list, which represents the maximum total difference `D` that can be obtained.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum total difference `D` by comparing the absolute differences between corresponding elements of the sorted lists `a` and `b` in reverse order.

Correctness: **True**
