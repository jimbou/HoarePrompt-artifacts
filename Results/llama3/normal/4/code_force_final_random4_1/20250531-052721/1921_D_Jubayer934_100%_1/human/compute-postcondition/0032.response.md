Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in ascending order, `stdin` is empty. If the absolute difference between the current element of `a` and the corresponding element of `b` from the end is greater than the absolute difference between the current element of `a` and the current element of `b`, then `temp` is set to the current index `i`. Otherwise, no change is made to `temp`. `ans` remains an empty list and `i` remains 0.***
