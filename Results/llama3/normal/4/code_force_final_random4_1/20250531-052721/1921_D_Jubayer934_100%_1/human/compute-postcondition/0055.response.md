Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, m is an integer greater than 1, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers in descending order, i is n, ans is an empty list, temp is -1, stdin is empty**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

After executing the code, the values of `n` and `m` are updated to integers greater than 1, which were read from the input. The list `a` is now a sorted list of `n` integers, and the list `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order. The variable `i` remains unchanged, still equal to `n`. The list `ans` is reset to an empty list. The variable `temp` is set to -1. The input buffer `stdin` is now empty, as all the input values have been read and processed.
