Output State: **n is an integer greater than 2, m is an integer, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers in ascending order, i is 2, ans is a list containing the absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of b, and the absolute difference between a[i-1] and b[i-1], temp is 2, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `temp` has been updated to 2, which is the value of `i`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged, as the code snippet only assigns a new value to `temp` and does not modify any other variables. The `break` statement does not affect the state of the variables.
