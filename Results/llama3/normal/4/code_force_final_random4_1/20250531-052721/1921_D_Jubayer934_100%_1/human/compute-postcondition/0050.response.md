Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in ascending order, `i` is `n`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `b` plus the absolute differences between the elements at indices `temp` to `n-1` of `a` and the elements at indices `-(n-temp)` to `-1` of `b`, `temp` is `n`, and `stdin` is empty.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the variable `i` has reached the value of `n`. The list `ans` now contains the absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `b`, plus the absolute differences between the elements at indices `temp` to `n-1` of `a` and the elements at indices `-(n-temp)` to `-1` of `b`. The variable `temp` has reached the value of `n`, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
