Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `temp` is an integer between 0 and `n-1`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for `i` ranging from 0 to the value of `n`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, stdin contains no input, `temp` is equal to `n` and `ans` now also contains the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` for `i` ranging from `temp` to `n`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same characteristics as the initial state, with the following changes:

- `temp` will be equal to `n`.
- `ans` will contain the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n`.
