The only variables in the loop head are variables `i`, `temp` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `temp` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `temp + 2`, `temp` is equal to `temp + 2` and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is `temp + 3` and `temp` is `temp + 3` and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than `temp + 3`.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than `temp + 3`, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `i` is equal to `temp + 3`, `temp` is equal to `temp + 3`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` for all `i` from 0 to `n`, stdin is empty**
