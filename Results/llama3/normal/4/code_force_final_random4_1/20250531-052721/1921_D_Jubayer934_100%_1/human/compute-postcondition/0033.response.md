Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in ascending order, `i` is 0, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `b`, `temp` is either the current index `i` or remains unchanged, `stdin` is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to include the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `b`. The value of `temp` may have been updated to the current index `i` if the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the corresponding element of `b` from the end is greater than the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `b`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
