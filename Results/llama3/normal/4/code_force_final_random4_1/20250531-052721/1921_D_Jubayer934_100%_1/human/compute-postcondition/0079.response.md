The code prints the sum of the absolute differences between the elements of list `a` and the elements of list `b` in reverse order, where the indices of the elements in list `a` and the reversed indices of the elements in list `b` are used for pairing.
Output: **sum of the absolute differences between the elements of list a and the elements of list b in reverse order**
