Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `temp` is either -1 or an integer between 0 and `n-1`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for `i` ranging from 0 to the value of `temp`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is as follows:

The loop will execute `n` times, and in each iteration, it will compare the absolute difference between the current elements of `a` and `b` with the absolute difference between the current element of `a` and the corresponding element of `b` from the end. If the latter is greater, it will update the `temp` variable with the current index. The `ans` list will accumulate the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `b` up to the index stored in `temp`. The loop will terminate after `n` iterations, leaving the other variables unchanged.
