Output State: **n is greater than 0, i is 0, m is an integer, temp is 0, ans is an empty list, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers in descending order, stdin contains no input.**

The code assigns the value of `i` to `temp`, making `temp` equal to 0. The `break` statement does not affect any variables. No other variables are affected by the code.
