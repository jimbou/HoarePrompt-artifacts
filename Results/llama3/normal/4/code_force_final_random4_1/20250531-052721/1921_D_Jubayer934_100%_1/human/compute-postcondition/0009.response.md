Postcondition: ***n is greater than 1, i is 1, m is an integer, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers in descending order, stdin contains no input. If the absolute difference between a[i] and b[-(n - i)] is greater than the absolute difference between a[i] and b[i], then temp is set to 1. Otherwise, temp remains unchanged.***
