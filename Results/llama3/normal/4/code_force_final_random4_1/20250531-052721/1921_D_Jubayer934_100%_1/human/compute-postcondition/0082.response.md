Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers n and m, followed by n integers a_i and m integers b_i. It then calculates the sum of the absolute differences between corresponding elements of the lists a and b, either in the original order or in reverse order, depending on which order results in a smaller sum. The function prints the calculated sum for each test case.**
