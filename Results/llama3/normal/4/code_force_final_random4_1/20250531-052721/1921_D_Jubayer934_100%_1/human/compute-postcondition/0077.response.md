Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `i` is equal to `n`, `temp` is equal to `n`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` for all `i` from 0 to `n`, and stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the value of `i` has reached `n`, which is the upper limit of the loop. The value of `temp` has also reached `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations. The list `ans` now contains the absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for all indices from 0 to `n-1`. The state of the other variables, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and stdin, remains unchanged.
