The code snippet consists of two lines: `temp = i` and `break`. The first line assigns the value of `i` to `temp`, and the second line is a break statement that does not affect any variables.

Since `i` is 1, `temp` becomes 1. No other variables are affected by the code.

Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, m is an integer, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers in ascending order, i is 1, ans is a list containing the absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of b, temp is 1, stdin is empty.**
