The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` is an integer, `temp` is either -1 or 0, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, stdin contains no input. If the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[-n]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`, then `temp` is set to 0.**
