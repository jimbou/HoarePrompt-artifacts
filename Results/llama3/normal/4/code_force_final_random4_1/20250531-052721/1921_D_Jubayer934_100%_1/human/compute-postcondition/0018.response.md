Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `temp` is an integer between 0 and `n-1`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for `i` ranging from 0 to the value of `temp`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, stdin contains no input, `temp` is less than `n` and `ans` now also contains the absolute difference between `a[temp]` and `b[-(n - temp)]`**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `temp`, `a`, `b`, and stdin remain unchanged. The list `ans` now contains one more element, which is the absolute difference between the `temp`-th element of `a` and the `(n-temp)`-th element of `b` (since `b` is in descending order).
