The code prints the sum of the absolute differences between elements of the lists `a` and `b`. The absolute differences are calculated in two parts: 
1. The absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for `i` ranging from 0 to the value of `n`. 
2. If `temp` is not -1, the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` for `i` ranging from `temp` to `n`. 
If `temp` is -1, only the first part of the absolute differences are considered.
Output: **sum of absolute differences between elements of lists a and b (where a is a sorted list of n integers and b is a sorted list of m integers in descending order)**
