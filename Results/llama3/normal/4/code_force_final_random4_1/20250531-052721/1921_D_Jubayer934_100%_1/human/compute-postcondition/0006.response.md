The code appends the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to the list `ans`. The value of `i` is 0, so the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]` is appended to `ans`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is an integer, `temp` is either -1 or 0, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, stdin contains no input. If the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[-n]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`, then `temp` is set to 0.**
