To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `temp`, and `n`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `i` is the loop variable, and its initial value is not explicitly set before the loop. However, since `i` is used in the loop head, we can infer that its initial value should be equal to `temp`.
2. `temp` is used as the starting point of the loop, and its current value is not -1. To ensure the loop executes, `temp` must be less than `n`. If `temp` is greater than or equal to `n`, the loop will not execute.
3. `n` is an integer greater than 0, which is already a valid state.

Considering these points, we can adjust the states as follows:

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `i` is equal to `temp`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `temp` is less than `n`, stdin is empty**

Note that we didn't change the states of `m`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, or stdin, as they are not directly related to the loop head.
