Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers in ascending order, temp is -1, ans is an empty list, stdin is empty**

The code snippet reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to `n` and `m`, respectively. Then, it reads a list of integers from stdin, sorts them in ascending order, and assigns the first `n` elements to `a`. Similarly, it reads another list of integers from stdin, sorts them in descending order, and assigns the first `m` elements to `b`. The `temp` variable is assigned a value of -1, and the `ans` list is initialized as an empty list. After executing the code, stdin is empty since all inputs have been read.
