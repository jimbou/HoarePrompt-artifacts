Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in ascending order, `temp` is -1, `ans` is an empty list, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 0. The current value of `i` is such that the absolute difference between the `i-th` element of `a` and the `(n-i)-th` element of `b` is greater than the absolute difference between the `i-th` element of `a` and the `i-th` element of `b`.**
