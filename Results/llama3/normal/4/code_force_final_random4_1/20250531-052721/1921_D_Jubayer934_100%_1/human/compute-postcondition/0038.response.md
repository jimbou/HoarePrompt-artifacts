The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in ascending order, `i` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `b`, and the absolute difference between `a[i-1]` and `b[i-1]`, `stdin` is empty. If the absolute difference between `a[i-1]` and `b[-(n - (i-1))]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i-1]` and `b[i-1]`, then `temp` is 1. Otherwise, `temp` remains unchanged.**
