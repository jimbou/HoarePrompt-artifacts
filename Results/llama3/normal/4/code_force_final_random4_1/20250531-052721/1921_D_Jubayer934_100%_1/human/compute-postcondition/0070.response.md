Postcondition: **n is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer greater than 1, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers in descending order, i is equal to n, ans is a list containing the absolute difference between a[i] and b[i] for all i from 0 to n-1. The current value of temp is not -1, it is set to the first i for which the absolute difference between a[i] and b[-(n - i)] is greater than the absolute difference between a[i] and b[i]. stdin is empty.**
