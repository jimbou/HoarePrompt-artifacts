Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 2, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in ascending order, `i` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `b`, and the absolute difference between `a[i-1]` and `b[i-1]`, `stdin` is empty. If the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, then `temp` is 2. Otherwise, `temp` remains unchanged.***
