Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, temp is -1, ans is an empty list, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers in descending order, stdin contains no input**.

In this output state, the values of `n` and `m` are integers read from the first line of input. The variable `temp` is assigned a constant value of -1. The list `ans` is initialized as an empty list. The list `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers read from the second line of input, and the list `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers read from the third line of input, in descending order. After executing the code, stdin is empty, meaning all input has been consumed.
