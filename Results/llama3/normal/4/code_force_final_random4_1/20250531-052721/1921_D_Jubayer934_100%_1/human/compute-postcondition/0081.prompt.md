Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three lines. The first line contains two integers n and m (1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_i (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The third line contains m integers b_i (1 <= b_i <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    temp = -1
    ans = []
    a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))[:n]
    b = sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)[:m]
    for i in range(n):
        if abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i]):
            temp = i
            break
        ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[i]))
    if temp != -1:
        for i in range(temp, n):
            ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]))
    print(sum(ans))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, stdin contains no input. If `temp` is not -1, `temp` is an integer between 0 and `n-1`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for `i` ranging from 0 to the value of `n`, and also contains the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` for `i` ranging from `temp` to `n`. If `temp` is -1, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for `i` ranging from 0 to the value of `temp`, and the sum of all elements in the list `ans` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in ascending order, `i` is `n`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `b`. If `temp` is not equal to -1, `ans` is updated to include the absolute differences between the elements at indices `temp` to `n-1` of `a` and the elements at indices `-(n-temp)` to `-1` of `b`, and `temp` is set to `n`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. `stdin` is empty., and the sum of the absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `b` (or the updated absolute differences between the elements at indices `temp` to `n-1` of `a` and the elements at indices `-(n-temp)` to `-1` of `b` if `temp` is not equal to -1) is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `i` is equal to `n`, `stdin` is empty. If `temp` is not equal to -1, then `temp` is equal to `n` and `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` for all `i` from 0 to `n`. Otherwise, the state of `temp` and `ans` remains unchanged, and the sum of the absolute differences between corresponding elements of the lists `a` and `b` in reverse order is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
