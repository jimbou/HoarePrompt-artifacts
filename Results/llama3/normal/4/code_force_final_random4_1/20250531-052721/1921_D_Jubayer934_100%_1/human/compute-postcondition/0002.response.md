To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be greater than 0, and since `i` is the loop variable, it should start at 0 (the first index in the range).

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is an integer, `temp` is -1, `ans` is an empty list, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, stdin contains no input**
