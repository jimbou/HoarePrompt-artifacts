The only variables in the loop head are variables  i, temp and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `temp` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `temp`, `temp` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is equal to `temp + 1` and `temp` is increased by 1 so `temp` is equal to `temp + 1` and `n` is still greater than 0.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `i` is equal to `temp + 1`, `temp` is equal to `temp + 1`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` for all `i` from 0 to `n`, stdin is empty**
