Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in ascending order, `i` is `n`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `b`. If `temp` is not equal to -1, `ans` is updated to include the absolute differences between the elements at indices `temp` to `n-1` of `a` and the elements at indices `-(n-temp)` to `-1` of `b`, and `temp` is set to `n`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. `stdin` is empty.***
