Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[1]` and `b[1]`, stdin contains no input. If the absolute difference between `a[1]` and `b[-(n - 1)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[1]` and `b[1]`, then `temp` is set to 1. Otherwise, `temp` remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still greater than 1, `i` is still 1, and `m` is still an integer. The lists `a` and `b` remain sorted, with `a` having `n` integers and `b` having `m` integers in descending order. The list `ans` now contains the absolute difference between the first elements of `a` and `b`. The stdin still contains no input. The value of `temp` is updated based on the comparison of the absolute differences between `a[1]` and `b[-(n - 1)]` and `a[1]` and `b[1]`.
