The code prints the sum of the absolute differences between corresponding elements of the lists `a` and `b` in reverse order.
Output: ** `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `i` is equal to `n`, `stdin` is empty. If `temp` is not equal to -1, then `temp` is equal to `n` and `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` for all `i` from 0 to `n`. Otherwise, the state of `temp` and `ans` remains unchanged, and the sum of the absolute differences between corresponding elements of the lists `a` and `b` in reverse order is being printed**
