Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is an integer, `temp` is -1, `ans` is an empty list, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, stdin contains no input. The current value of the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the last element of `b` is greater than the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `b`.***
