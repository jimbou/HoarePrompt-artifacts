The only variables in the loop head are variables  i, temp and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n+1`, `n` is an integer. For the loop to execute again `i` must be `n` and `n` must be greater than `n` so `n` must be `n+1`. 
State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n+1` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in ascending order, `i` is `n`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `b` plus the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the last element of `b`, plus the absolute difference between the element at index `i` of `a` and the element at index `-(n-i)` of `b`, `temp` is `n`, and `stdin` is empty.**
