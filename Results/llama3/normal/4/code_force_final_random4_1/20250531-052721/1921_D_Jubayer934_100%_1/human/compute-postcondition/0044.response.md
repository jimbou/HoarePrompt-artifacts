To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `temp` and `n`. The loop will execute if `temp` is less than `n`. Since `temp` is not -1, indicating that an index was found where the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, we can adjust the state of `temp` to be less than `n`. Additionally, we can keep the state of `n` as an integer.

State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in ascending order, `i` is `n`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `b`, `temp` is less than `n`, and `stdin` is empty.**
