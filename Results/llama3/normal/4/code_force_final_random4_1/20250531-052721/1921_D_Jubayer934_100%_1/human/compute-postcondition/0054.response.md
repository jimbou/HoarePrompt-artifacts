The only variable in the loop head is variable `_`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `int(input())`. If `int(input())` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `int(input())` is greater than 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time `int(input())` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in ascending order, `i` is `n`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `b`, `temp` is `n`, `stdin` is not empty and contains an integer greater than 1**
