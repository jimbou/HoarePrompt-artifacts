Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `i` is equal to `n`, `stdin` is empty. If `temp` is not equal to -1, then `temp` is equal to `n` and `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` for all `i` from 0 to `n`. Otherwise, the state of `temp` and `ans` remains unchanged, and the sum of the absolute differences between corresponding elements of the lists `a` and `b` in reverse order is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing and has processed all the test cases in the input. The values of `n` and `m` are still integers, and the lists `a` and `b` are still sorted in ascending and descending order, respectively. The variable `i` has reached the value of `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations. The input stream `stdin` is empty, indicating that all test cases have been processed. If `temp` is not equal to -1, it means that the loop found a pair of elements in `a` and `b` that had a larger absolute difference than the corresponding elements in the reverse order, and the list `ans` contains the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `b` in the reverse order. Otherwise, the state of `temp` and `ans` remains unchanged, and the sum of the absolute differences between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` in the reverse order is being printed.
