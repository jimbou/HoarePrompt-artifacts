Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `i` is equal to `temp`, `temp` is less than `n`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` for all `i` from 0 to `n`, stdin is empty**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` and `m` remains the same. The lists `a` and `b` also remain unchanged. The value of `i` and `temp` is still the same and less than `n`. The list `ans` now contains one more element which is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`. The stdin remains empty.
