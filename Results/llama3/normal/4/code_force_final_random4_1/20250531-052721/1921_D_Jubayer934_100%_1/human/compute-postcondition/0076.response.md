Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than `temp + 3`, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `i` is equal to `temp + 3`, `temp` is equal to `temp + 3`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` for all `i` from 0 to `n`, and the absolute difference between `a[temp + 3]` and `b[-(n - (temp + 3))]` is appended to `ans`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and `temp` remains the same as in the initial state. The list `ans` now contains an additional element, which is the absolute difference between the element at index `temp + 3` in list `a` and the element at index `-(n - (temp + 3))` in list `b`.
