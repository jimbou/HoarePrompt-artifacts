To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `temp`, and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `temp`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`, `temp` is less than `n`, and `n` is an integer.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes `n+1`. However, since `i` is now greater than `n`, the loop will not execute again. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `temp` to make the loop execute again.

Since `temp` is less than `n`, we can increase `temp` by 1, making it equal to `n`. This will allow the loop to execute again.

The other variables, `a`, `b`, `ans`, and `stdin`, are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in ascending order, `i` is `n+1`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `b` plus the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the last element of `b`, `temp` is `n`, and `stdin` is empty.**
