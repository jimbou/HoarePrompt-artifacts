State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `i` is less than `n` and increased by 1, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` if it is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `temp` is either unchanged or set to `i` if the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.**
