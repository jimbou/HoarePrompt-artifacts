Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `temp` is an integer between 0 and `n-1`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for `i` ranging from 0 to the value of `temp + 2`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, stdin contains no input, `temp` is less than `n` and `ans` now also contains the absolute difference between `a[temp + 1]` and `b[-(n - temp - 1)]` and `a[temp + 2]` and `b[-(n - temp - 2)]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `ans` now contains the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `b` up to index `temp + 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
