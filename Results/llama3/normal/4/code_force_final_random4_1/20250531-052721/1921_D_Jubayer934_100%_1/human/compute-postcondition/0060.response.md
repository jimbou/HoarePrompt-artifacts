Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `i` is less than `n`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, stdin is empty. If the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, then `temp` is set to `i`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The code appends the absolute difference between the `i-th` element of list `a` and the `i-th` element of list `b` to the list `ans`. The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and stdin remain unchanged. The value of `temp` is still set to `i` if the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
