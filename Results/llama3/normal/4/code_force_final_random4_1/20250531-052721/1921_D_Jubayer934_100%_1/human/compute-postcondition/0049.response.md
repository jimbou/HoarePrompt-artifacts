Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n+1` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in ascending order, `i` is `n`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `b` plus the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the last element of `b`, plus the absolute difference between the element at index `i` of `a` and the element at index `-(n-i)` of `b`, plus the absolute difference between the element at index `i` of `a` and the element at index `-(n-i)` of `b`, `temp` is `n`, and `stdin` is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by appending the absolute difference between the element at index `i` of `a` and the element at index `-(n-i)` of `b`. This is in addition to the existing absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `b`, the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the last element of `b`, and the absolute difference between the element at index `i` of `a` and the element at index `-(n-i)` of `b`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
