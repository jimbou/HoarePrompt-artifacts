Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers in ascending order, temp is -1, ans is an empty list, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i]):
        temp = i
        break
    ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[i]))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in ascending order, `i` is 0, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `b`, `temp` is either the current index `i` or remains unchanged, `stdin` is empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in ascending order, `i` is 1, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `b`, and the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `stdin` is empty. If the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, then `temp` is 1. Otherwise, `temp` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in ascending order, `i` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `b`, the absolute difference between `a[i-1]` and `b[i-1]`, and the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `stdin` is empty. If the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, then `temp` is 2. Otherwise, `temp` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
