Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer greater than 1, a is a sorted list of n integers, b is a sorted list of m integers in descending order, i is less than n, stdin is empty. If the absolute difference between a[i] and b[-(n - i)] is greater than the absolute difference between a[i] and b[i], then temp is set to i and ans remains an empty list. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
