Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the maximum difference D that Vasya can obtain by choosing n integers from the list b_i and arranging them in a certain order to obtain an array c_i of length n.

The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the values of n and m, followed by the lists a_i and b_i. It sorts the lists a_i and b_i in ascending and descending order respectively.

The program then iterates over the list a_i and for each element, it calculates the absolute difference with the corresponding element in the list b_i. If the absolute difference is greater when the elements are taken from the end of the list b_i, it updates the list ans with these differences.

Finally, the program prints the sum of the absolute differences in the list ans, which represents the maximum difference D that Vasya can obtain.

Correctness: **True**
