Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the maximum difference D that can be obtained by rearranging the array c_i to be as different as possible from Petya's array a_i.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It first sorts the array a_i in ascending order and the array b_i in descending order.
2. It then iterates through the sorted array a_i and for each element, it checks if the absolute difference between the current element and the corresponding element in the sorted array b_i is greater than the absolute difference between the current element and the corresponding element in the sorted array b_i in reverse order (i.e., b[-(n - i)]).
3. If the condition in step 2 is true, it means that the current element in a_i can be paired with a larger element in b_i to maximize the difference. In this case, it updates the temp variable to the current index i and breaks the loop.
4. If the temp variable is not -1, it means that the program found a pair of elements that can be swapped to maximize the difference. In this case, it appends the absolute differences between the elements in a_i and the corresponding elements in b_i in reverse order to the ans list.
5. Finally, it prints the sum of the absolute differences in the ans list, which represents the maximum difference D that can be obtained.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where n = m or where all elements in a_i and b_i are equal. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
