Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, `i` is less than `n`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` if it is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `temp` is either unchanged or set to `i` if the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.**

In this output state, the list `ans` has been updated to include the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`. The value of `temp` remains unchanged if the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` is greater than or equal to the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`, otherwise, it is set to `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.
