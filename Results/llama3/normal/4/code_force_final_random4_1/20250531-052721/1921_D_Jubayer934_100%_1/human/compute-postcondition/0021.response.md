The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `temp`, `n` is greater than `temp`. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is `temp + 1` and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than `temp + 1`.
State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `temp` is an integer between 0 and `n-1`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for `i` ranging from 0 to the value of `temp + 3`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, stdin contains no input, `temp` is less than `n` and `ans` now also contains the absolute difference between `a[temp + 1]` and `b[-(n - temp - 1)]` and `a[temp + 2]` and `b[-(n - temp - 2)]` and `a[temp + 3]` and `b[-(n - temp - 3)]`.**
