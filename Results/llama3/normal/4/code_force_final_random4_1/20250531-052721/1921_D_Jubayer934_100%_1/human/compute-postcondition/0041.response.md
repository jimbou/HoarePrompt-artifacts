Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in ascending order, `i` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `b`, the absolute difference between `a[i-1]` and `b[i-1]`, and the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `stdin` is empty. If the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, then `temp` is 2. Otherwise, `temp` remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `ans` now contains three elements: the absolute difference between the first elements of `a` and `b`, the absolute difference between the second elements of `a` and `b`, and the absolute difference between the third elements of `a` and `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
