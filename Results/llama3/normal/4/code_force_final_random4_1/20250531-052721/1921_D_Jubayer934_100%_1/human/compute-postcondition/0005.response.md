Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is an integer, `temp` is either -1 or 0, `ans` is an empty list, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, stdin contains no input. If the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, then `temp` is set to 0.***
