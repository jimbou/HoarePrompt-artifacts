Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in ascending order, `i` is `n`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `b`, `temp` is the index where the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and `stdin` is empty. The current value of `temp` is not -1, indicating that such an index was found.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(temp, n):
    ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in ascending order, `i` is `n`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `b` plus the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the last element of `b`, `temp` is less than `n`, and `stdin` is empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in ascending order, `i` is `n+1`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `b` plus the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the last element of `b`, plus the absolute difference between the element at index `i` of `a` and the element at index `-(n-i)` of `b`, `temp` is `n`, and `stdin` is empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n+1` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in ascending order, `i` is `n`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `b` plus the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the last element of `b`, plus the absolute difference between the element at index `i` of `a` and the element at index `-(n-i)` of `b`, plus the absolute difference between the element at index `i` of `a` and the element at index `-(n-i)` of `b`, `temp` is `n`, and `stdin` is empty.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
