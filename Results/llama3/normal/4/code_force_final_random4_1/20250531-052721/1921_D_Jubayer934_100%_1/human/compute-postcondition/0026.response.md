Output: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, stdin contains no input. If `temp` is not -1, `temp` is an integer between 0 and `n-1`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for `i` ranging from 0 to the value of `n`, and also contains the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` for `i` ranging from `temp` to `n`. If `temp` is -1, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for `i` ranging from 0 to the value of `temp`, and the sum of all elements in the list `ans` is being printed**
