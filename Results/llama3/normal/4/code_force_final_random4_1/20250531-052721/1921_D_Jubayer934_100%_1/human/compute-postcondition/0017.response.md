To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `temp`, and `n`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:


1. The loop will execute if `temp` is less than `n`. This is because the loop iterates from `temp` to `n-1`. If `temp` is equal to or greater than `n`, the loop will not execute.
2. The value of `i` is not relevant before the loop starts, but it will be initialized to `temp` at the beginning of the loop.


Considering these points, the adjusted state is:


State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `temp` is an integer between 0 and `n-1`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for `i` ranging from 0 to the value of `temp`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order, stdin contains no input, `temp` is less than `n`**
