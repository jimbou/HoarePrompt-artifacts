To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Since `t` is already an integer between 1 and 10^4, we can conclude that `t` is at least 1. Therefore, the state of `t` does not need to be adjusted.

However, we need to adjust the state of `i` to ensure the loop executes. Since the loop iterates over the range of `t`, we can set `i` to 0, which is the starting value of the range.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, stdin contains t lines, each containing three integers a, b, and m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18)**
