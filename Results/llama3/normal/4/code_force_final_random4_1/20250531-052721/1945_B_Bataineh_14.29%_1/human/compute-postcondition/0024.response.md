Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is `t-1`, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, stdin contains 0 lines. If `m` is less than `a` or `m` is less than `b`, the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, if `m` is larger than or equal to `a` and `m` is larger than or equal to `b`, the result of `m // a + m // b + 2` is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the variable `i` has reached its final value, which is `t-1`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are still integers between 1 and 10^18, but there are no more lines left in stdin. The loop has printed the result of the calculation for each iteration, either 2 or `m // a + m // b + 2`, depending on the values of `m`, `a`, and `b`.
