Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing three integers. The current value of `m` is less than `a` or `m` is less than `b`***
