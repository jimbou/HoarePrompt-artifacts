The code reads a line from the input, splits it into three integers, and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, and stdin contains `t` lines, each containing three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` (1 <= `a`, `b`, `m` <= 10^18).

After executing the code, the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are updated to the first line of input from stdin. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing three integers.**
