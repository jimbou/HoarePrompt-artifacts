Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, stdin contains `t-4` lines, each containing three integers.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are updated to the three integers read from the first line of the input. The stdin now contains `t-4` lines, each containing three integers, since one line has been consumed by the `input()` function.
