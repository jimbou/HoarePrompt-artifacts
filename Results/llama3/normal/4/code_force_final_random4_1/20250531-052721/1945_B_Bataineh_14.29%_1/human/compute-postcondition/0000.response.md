Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t lines, each containing three integers a, b, and m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18)**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first integer input from stdin, which is between 1 and 10^4. The remaining input in stdin consists of `t` lines, each containing three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`, where each of these integers is between 1 and 10^18.
