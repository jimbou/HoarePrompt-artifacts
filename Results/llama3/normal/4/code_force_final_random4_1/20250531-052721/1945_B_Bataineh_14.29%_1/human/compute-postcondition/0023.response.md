Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, stdin contains `t-4` lines, each containing three integers. If `m` is less than `a` or `m` is less than `b`, the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, `m // a + m // b + 2` is printed.***
