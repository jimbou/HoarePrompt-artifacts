Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when `m` is equal to `a` or `b`. In this case, the program prints `2`, but the correct answer should be `m // a + m // b + 1` or `m // a + m // b + 2` depending on whether `a` and `b` are equal or not.

For example, if `a = 5`, `b = 5`, and `m = 5`, the program prints `2`, but the correct answer is `3` because three fireworks can be seen simultaneously: one launched at time `0`, one launched at time `5`, and one launched at time `10`.

The correct program should handle this case separately and print `m // a + m // b + 1` or `m // a + m // b + 2` depending on whether `a` and `b` are equal or not.
