The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, stdin contains `t-2` lines, each containing three integers. If `m` is less than `a` or `m` is less than `b`, the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, if `m` is larger than or equal to `a` and `m` is larger than or equal to `b`, the result of `m // a + m // b + 2` is printed.**
