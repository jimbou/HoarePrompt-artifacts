This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers a, b, and m. It then calculates and prints the minimum number of operations required to make a and b equal to m. If m is less than either a or b, it prints 2. Otherwise, it prints the result of m divided by a, plus m divided by b, plus 2. The function processes all test cases and then terminates, leaving the standard input empty.
