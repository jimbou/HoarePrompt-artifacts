Output: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, stdin contains `t-3` lines, each containing three integers. If `m` is less than `a` or `m` is less than `b`, the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, if `m` is larger than or equal to `a` and `m` is larger than or equal to `b`, the result of `m // a + m // b + 2` is printed, and the result of `m // a + m // b + 2` is printed**
