Postcondition: **n is a positive integer, q is a positive integer, a is an empty list, x is a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the result of 0 XOR i for each i in a, inds is a dictionary with keys being all the elements in x, each key maps to a list containing the indices of the corresponding element in x, i is 0, l and r are returned by func_1(int), lower is the index of x[r] that is less than l, upper is the index of x[l - 1] that is less than or equal to r. The current value of upper is greater than the current value of lower.**
