Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

# Annotated Functions:
from collections import defaultdict

if __name__ == '__main__':
    (t,) = func_1(int)
    for _ in range(t):
        func_5()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: cast is a function that takes a string and returns a value of a specific type, and input() is a function that returns a string of space-separated values.
    return map(cast, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that applies the cast function to each string in the list of space-separated values returned by the input() function. The cast function converts each string to a specific type, but the exact type is not specified. The map object is an iterator that yields the converted values on demand.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a string of space-separated values as input, applies a type conversion to each value using a specified cast function, and returns an iterator that yields the converted values on demand.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of elements of any type and predicate is a function that takes one argument and returns a boolean value.
    l, r = 0, len(arr)
    while l + 1 < r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        
        if predicate(arr[mid]):
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of elements of any type, `predicate` is a function that takes one argument and returns a boolean value, `l` and `r` are integers. `l` and `r` are equal.
    if predicate(arr[l]) :
        return l
        #The program returns an integer `l` which is equal to `r`, and the value of `predicate(arr[l])` is True.
    #State: *`arr` is a list of elements of any type, `predicate` is a function that takes one argument and returns a boolean value, `l` and `r` are integers. `l` and `r` are equal. The predicate function returns false when applied to the element of `arr` at index `l`.
    return None
    #The program returns None

#Overall this is what the function does:This function performs a binary search on a list of elements based on a given predicate function. It returns the index of the first element in the list for which the predicate function returns True, or None if no such element is found. The function takes a list of elements and a predicate function as input and modifies the list indices (l and r) during the search process. The final state of the program is either an integer index where the predicate is True or None, indicating the absence of a matching element.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of elements and predicate is a function that takes an element of arr as input and returns a boolean value
    return func_2(arr, predicate)
    #The program returns the result of applying the function `func_2` to the list `arr` and the function `predicate`. The function `predicate` is applied to each element of `arr` to filter the elements based on the boolean value returned by `predicate`. The result is a filtered list of elements from `arr` that satisfy the condition specified by `predicate`.

#Overall this is what the function does:Filters a list of elements based on a given predicate function, returning a new list containing only the elements that satisfy the condition specified by the predicate.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of elements of any type and predicate is a function that takes one argument and returns a boolean value.
    result = func_2(arr, predicate)
    if (result is not None) :
        return result + 1
        #The program returns the value of `result` (which is the return value of `func_2(arr, predicate)`) plus 1, where `result` is not None, `arr` is a list of elements of any type, and `predicate` is a function that takes one argument and returns a boolean value.
    #State: *`arr` is a list of elements of any type, `predicate` is a function that takes one argument and returns a boolean value, `result` is the return value of `func_2(arr, predicate)`, and `result` is `None`
    return None
    #The program returns None

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of elements and a predicate function as input, calls another function (`func_2`) with these inputs, and returns the result of that function call plus 1 if the result is not None; otherwise, it returns None.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and q are positive integers, a is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30, l and r are positive integers such that 1 <= l < r <= n.
    n, q = func_1(int)
    a = list(func_1(int))
    x = [0]
    inds = defaultdict(list)
    inds[0].append(0)
    for i in a:
        x.append(x[-1] ^ i)
        
        inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)
        
    #State: n is a positive integer, q is a positive integer, a is an empty list, x is a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the result of 0 XOR i for each i in a, inds is a dictionary with keys being all the elements in x, each key maps to a list containing the indices of the corresponding element in x, i is the last element in the original list a.
    for i in range(q):
        l, r = func_1(int)
        
        if x[l - 1] == x[r]:
            print('Yes')
            continue
        
        lower = inds[x[r]][func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0]
        
        upper = inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]
        
        if upper > lower:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: n is a positive integer, q is a positive integer, a is an empty list, x is a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the result of 0 XOR i for each i in a, inds is a dictionary with keys being all the elements in x, each key maps to a list containing the indices of the corresponding element in x, i is q - 1, l and r are returned by func_1(int), lower is the index of x[r] that is less than l, upper is the index of x[l - 1] that is less than or equal to r. If upper is greater than lower, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines whether there exists a subarray within a given array 'a' that has a specific XOR value. It takes as input a list of non-negative integers 'a' and a number of queries 'q'. For each query, it takes two indices 'l' and 'r' and checks if there is a subarray between 'l' and 'r' (inclusive) that has an XOR value equal to the XOR value of the subarray from the start of 'a' to 'l-1'. If such a subarray exists, it prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'. The function iterates over all queries and prints the result for each one.
