Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `q` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `x` is a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the result of 0 XOR i for each i in a, `inds` is a dictionary with keys being all the elements in `x`, each key maps to a list containing the indices of the corresponding element in `x`, `i` is 2, `l` and `r` are returned by `func_1(int)`, `lower` is the index of `x[r]` that is less than `l`, `upper` is the index of `x[l - 1]` that is less than or equal to `r`. Since `upper` is greater than `lower`, 'Yes' is printed and we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop and move to the next iteration.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop and move to the next iteration due to the `continue` statement. All variables maintain their original values, and the program flow is altered to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next one.
