Output State: **n is a positive integer, q is a positive integer, a is an empty list, x is a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the result of 0 XOR i for each i in a, inds is a dictionary with keys being all the elements in x, each key maps to a list containing the indices of the corresponding element in x, i is 1, l and r are returned by func_1(int), lower is the index of x[r] that is less than l, upper is the index of x[l - 1] that is less than or equal to r.**

The code snippet updates the values of `lower` and `upper` based on the current values of `l`, `r`, and the dictionary `inds`. The `func_4` and `func_3` functions are used to find the indices of the elements in `x` that satisfy certain conditions. The `lower` variable is assigned the index of the element in `x[r]` that is less than `l`, and the `upper` variable is assigned the index of the element in `x[l - 1]` that is less than or equal to `r`. The values of `n`, `q`, `a`, `x`, `inds`, `i`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged.
