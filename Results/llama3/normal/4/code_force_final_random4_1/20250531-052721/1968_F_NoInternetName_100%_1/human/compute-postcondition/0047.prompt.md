Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, q is a positive integer, a is an empty list, x is a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the result of 0 XOR i for each i in a, inds is a dictionary with keys being all the elements in x, each key maps to a list containing the indices of the corresponding element in x, i is the last element in the original list a.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(q):
    l, r = func_1(int)
    if x[l - 1] == x[r]:
        print('Yes')
        continue
    lower = inds[x[r]][func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0]
    upper = inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]
    if upper > lower:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is a positive integer, q is a positive integer, a is an empty list, x is a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the result of 0 XOR i for each i in a, inds is a dictionary with keys being all the elements in x, each key maps to a list containing the indices of the corresponding element in x, i is 0, l and r are returned by func_1(int), lower is the index of x[r] that is less than l, upper is the index of x[l - 1] that is less than or equal to r. If the current value of upper is greater than the current value of lower, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is a positive integer, q is a positive integer, a is an empty list, x is a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the result of 0 XOR i for each i in a, inds is a dictionary with keys being all the elements in x, each key maps to a list containing the indices of the corresponding element in x, i is 1, l and r are returned by func_1(int), lower is the index of x[r] that is less than l, upper is the index of x[l - 1] that is less than or equal to r. If upper is greater than lower, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is a positive integer, q is a positive integer, a is an empty list, x is a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the result of 0 XOR i for each i in a, inds is a dictionary with keys being all the elements in x, each key maps to a list containing the indices of the corresponding element in x, i is 2, l and r are returned by func_1(int), lower is the index of x[r] that is less than l, upper is the index of x[l - 1] that is less than or equal to r. If upper is greater than lower, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
