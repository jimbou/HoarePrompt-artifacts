Output State: **n is a positive integer, q is a positive integer, a is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30 that must have at least 3 elements, x is a list containing four elements: 0, the result of 0 XOR i, the result of (0 XOR i) XOR i, and the result of ((0 XOR i) XOR i) XOR i, inds is a dictionary with two keys 0 and ((0 XOR i) XOR i) XOR i, which maps to a list containing three elements: 0, the index of the second element in list x, the index of the third element in list x, and the index of the fourth element in list x, i is the third element in list a**

Explanation:
The first line appends the result of `x[-1] ^ i` to the list `x`. Since `x[-1]` is the result of `(0 XOR i) XOR i` and `i` is the third element in list `a`, the new element appended to `x` is the result of `((0 XOR i) XOR i) XOR i`. 

The second line appends the index of the newly appended element in `x` to the list of indices in the dictionary `inds` with the key being the value of the newly appended element in `x`. Since the newly appended element is the result of `((0 XOR i) XOR i) XOR i`, this value becomes a new key in the dictionary `inds`, and its corresponding value is a list containing the index of the newly appended element in `x`. 

The values of `n`, `q`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.
