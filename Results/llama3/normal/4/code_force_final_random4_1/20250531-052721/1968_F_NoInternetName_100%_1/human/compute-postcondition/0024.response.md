Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `q` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `x` is a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the result of 0 XOR i for each i in a, `inds` is a dictionary with keys being all the elements in x, each key maps to a list containing the indices of the corresponding element in x, `i` is 1, `l` and `r` are returned by func_1(int), `lower` is the index of x[r] that is less than l, `upper` is the index of x[l - 1] that is less than or equal to r. If the current value of upper is greater than the current value of lower, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `q`, `a`, `x`, `inds`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The values of `l` and `r` are updated to the values returned by the function `func_1(int)`. The values of `lower` and `upper` are also updated based on the new values of `l` and `r`. The printing of 'Yes' or 'No' depends on the comparison of `upper` and `lower`.
