Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n and q are positive integers, a is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30, x is a list containing a single element 0, inds is a dictionary with a single key 0, which maps to a list containing a single element 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in a:
    x.append(x[-1] ^ i)
    inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is a positive integer, q is a positive integer, a is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30 that must have at least 1 element, x is a list containing two elements: 0 and the result of 0 XOR i, inds is a dictionary with a single key 0, which maps to a list containing two elements: 0 and the index of the second element in list x, i is the first element in list a

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is a positive integer, q is a positive integer, a is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30 that must have at least 2 elements, x is a list containing three elements: 0, the result of 0 XOR i, and the result of (0 XOR i) XOR i, inds is a dictionary with a single key 0, which maps to a list containing three elements: 0, the index of the second element in list x, and the index of the third element in list x, i is the second element in list a

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is a positive integer, q is a positive integer, a is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30 that must have at least 3 elements, x is a list containing four elements: 0, the result of 0 XOR i, the result of (0 XOR i) XOR i, and the result of ((0 XOR i) XOR i) XOR i, inds is a dictionary with two keys 0 and ((0 XOR i) XOR i) XOR i, which maps to a list containing three elements: 0, the index of the second element in list x, the index of the third element in list x, and the index of the fourth element in list x, i is the third element in list a




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
