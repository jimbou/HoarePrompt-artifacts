Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `q` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `x` is a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the result of 0 XOR i for each i in a, `inds` is a dictionary with keys being all the elements in `x`, each key maps to a list containing the indices of the corresponding element in `x`, `i` is 2, `l` and `r` are returned by `func_1(int)`, `lower` is the index of `x[r]` that is less than `l`, `upper` is the index of `x[l - 1]` that is less than or equal to `r`. If `upper` is greater than `lower`, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.**

In this output state, the values of `l` and `r` have been updated to be the return values of `func_1(int)`, but the rest of the variables remain unchanged. The condition for printing 'Yes' or 'No' still depends on the comparison between `upper` and `lower`, which are still defined based on the values of `l` and `r`.
