Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `q` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `x` is a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the result of 0 XOR i for each i in a, `inds` is a dictionary with keys being all the elements in x, each key maps to a list containing the indices of the corresponding element in x, `i` is 0, `l` and `r` are returned by `func_1(int)`**.

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that `l` and `r` have been assigned the values returned by the function `func_1` when called with an integer argument. The values of `n`, `q`, `a`, `x`, `inds`, and `i` remain unchanged.
