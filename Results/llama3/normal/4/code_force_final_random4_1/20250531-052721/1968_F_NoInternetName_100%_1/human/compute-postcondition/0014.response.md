Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `q` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `x` is a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the result of 0 XOR i for each i in a, `inds` is a dictionary with keys being all the elements in x, each key maps to a list containing the indices of the corresponding element in x, `i` is 0, `l` and `r` are returned by `func_1(int)`. If the current value of `x[l - 1]` is equal to the current value of `x[r]`, then we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop and move to the next iteration. Otherwise, the program continues executing the rest of the code inside the current loop.***
