Output State: **n is a positive integer, q is a positive integer, a is an empty list, x is a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the result of 0 XOR i for each i in a, inds is a dictionary with keys being all the elements in x, each key maps to a list containing the indices of the corresponding element in x, i is the last element in the original list a.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the list `a` will be empty because all its elements have been processed. The list `x` will contain one more element than the original length of `a`, with each element being the result of XORing the previous element with the corresponding element from `a`. The dictionary `inds` will have keys that are all the elements in `x`, and each key will map to a list of indices where the corresponding element appears in `x`. The variable `i` will be the last element that was processed from the original list `a`.
