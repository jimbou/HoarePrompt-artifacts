Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `q` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `x` is a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the result of 0 XOR i for each i in a, `inds` is a dictionary with keys being all the elements in x, each key maps to a list containing the indices of the corresponding element in x, `i` is 1, `l` and `r` are returned by func_1(int), `lower` is the index of x[r] that is less than l, `upper` is the index of x[l - 1] that is less than or equal to r, and we skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration.**

The `continue` statement skips the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration, so the values of the variables do not change. The loop will continue to execute with the next iteration, and the conditions and variables will be evaluated again.
