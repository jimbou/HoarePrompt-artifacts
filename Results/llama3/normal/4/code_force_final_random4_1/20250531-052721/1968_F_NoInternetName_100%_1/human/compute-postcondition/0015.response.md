Output State: **n is a positive integer, q is a positive integer, a is an empty list, x is a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the result of 0 XOR i for each i in a, inds is a dictionary with keys being all the elements in x, each key maps to a list containing the indices of the corresponding element in x, i is 0, l and r are returned by func_1(int), lower is the index of x[r] that is less than l, upper is the index of x[l - 1] that is less than or equal to r.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `q`, `a`, `x`, `inds`, `i`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the given code snippet. The code only introduces two new variables, `lower` and `upper`, which are calculated based on the existing values in `inds`, `x`, `l`, and `r`. The `lower` variable holds the index of `x[r]` that is less than `l`, and the `upper` variable holds the index of `x[l - 1]` that is less than or equal to `r`.
