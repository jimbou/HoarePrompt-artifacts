#State of the program right berfore the function call: cast is a function that takes a string and returns a value of a specific type, and input() is a function that returns a string of space-separated values.
    return map(cast, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that applies the cast function to each string in the list of space-separated values returned by the input() function. The cast function converts each string to a specific type, and the resulting values are returned as a map object.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a string of space-separated values as input, applies a specified cast function to each value, and returns a map object containing the converted values. The function effectively performs type conversion on user-provided input and returns the result as a map object.

    return None
    #The program returns None

#Overall this is what the function does:This function performs a binary search on a list `arr` using a given predicate function. It returns the index of the first element in the list for which the predicate function returns True, or None if no such element is found.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of values of any type and predicate is a function that takes one argument and returns a boolean value.
    return func_2(arr, predicate)
    #The program returns the result of applying the function func_2 to the list 'arr' and the function 'predicate'. The function 'predicate' is a function that takes one argument and returns a boolean value. The function 'func_2' is not defined in the initial state, so its behavior is unknown. However, it is applied to the list 'arr' and the function 'predicate' as arguments.

#Overall this is what the function does:Applies an unknown function `func_2` to a list `arr` and a predicate function, returning the result. The predicate function is expected to take one argument and return a boolean value. The function's behavior is determined by the unknown function `func_2`, which is applied to the list `arr` and the predicate function as arguments.

    #State: *`arr` is a list of elements of any type, `predicate` is a function that takes one argument and returns a boolean value, `result` is the return value of `func_2(arr, predicate)`, which is a value of any type, and `result` is None
    return None
    #The program returns None

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of elements and a predicate function as input, calls another function (`func_2`) with these inputs, and returns the result of that call plus one if it is not None; otherwise, it returns None.

If upper is greater than lower, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines whether there exists an element in a list that, when XORed with a given range of elements, results in a specific value. It takes as input a list of non-negative integers and a series of queries, each consisting of a range of indices. For each query, it checks if there exists an element in the range that, when XORed with the corresponding element in the list, results in a value that has been seen before in the list. If such an element exists, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function iterates over all queries and prints the result for each one.
