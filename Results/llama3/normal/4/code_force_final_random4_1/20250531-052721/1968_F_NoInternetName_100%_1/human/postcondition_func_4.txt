This function determines whether there exists an element in a list that, when XORed with a given range of elements, results in a specific value. It takes as input a list of non-negative integers and a series of queries, each consisting of a range of indices. For each query, it checks if there exists an element in the range that, when XORed with the corresponding element in the list, results in a value that has been seen before in the list. If such an element exists, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function iterates over all queries and prints the result for each one.
