Output State: **`t` is an integer larger than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with no leading zeros and at least one trailing zero, `res` is being printed and is equal to the number of zeros in the list `a`, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, and `i` is equal to the original length of `a` minus 1.**

The value of `a` has been changed by removing the last element from the list, which was a zero. The value of `i` has also been changed to be equal to the original length of `a` minus 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
