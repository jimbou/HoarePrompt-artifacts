Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the number of free cells (containing 0) in each test case. It takes no parameters and returns no value, but instead prints the results directly. The function iterates over multiple test cases, each containing a list of cells with chips (1) or free cells (0). It trims leading and trailing free cells from the list, then counts and prints the number of remaining free cells.**
