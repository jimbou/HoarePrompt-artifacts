The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `a`. The first element of `a` is 0, so the number of zeros in the list `a` is decreased by 1. The value of `res` is equal to the number of zeros in the list `a` which is `res-1`, so `res` is decreased by 1. The length of `a` is decreased by 1, so `i` is decreased by 1. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer larger than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with length `i-2` and the first element is not specified, `res` is being printed and is equal to the number of zeros in the list `a` which is `res-2`, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, and `i` is equal to the length of `a` plus one.**
