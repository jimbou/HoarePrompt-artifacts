To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`. The loop will execute if `a` has at least one element. Since `a` is a list of integers with all trailing zeros removed, we can adjust its state to have at least one non-zero integer. We also need to adjust the state of `i` to be 0, which is the starting index of the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer larger than 0 and at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least one non-zero integer and all trailing zeros removed, `res` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, and the list `a` with all trailing zeros removed is being printed, `i` is 0**
