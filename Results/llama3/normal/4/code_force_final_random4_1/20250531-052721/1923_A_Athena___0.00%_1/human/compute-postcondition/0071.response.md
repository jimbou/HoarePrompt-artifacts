To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of `a` so that it is not empty and its first element is 0.

State: **`t` is an integer larger than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that can have leading zeros, must have at least `i` elements, and the first element of `a` is 0, `res` is equal to the number of zeros in the list `a` plus `i-2` if the first element of `a` is 0 and all elements of `a` are 0, otherwise `res` is equal to the number of zeros in the list `a` plus `i-3` if the first element of `a` is 0 and not all elements of `a` are 0, otherwise `res` is equal to the number of zeros in the list `a` plus `i-4` if the first element of `a` is not 0 and the second element of `a` is 0, otherwise `res` is equal to the number of zeros in the list `a` plus `i-5` if the first element of `a` is not 0 and the second element of `a` is not 0 and the third element of `a` is 0, and so on, `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases, and `i` is equal to the original length of `a` minus the number of trailing zeros in the original list `a`, and the value of `res` is printed.**
