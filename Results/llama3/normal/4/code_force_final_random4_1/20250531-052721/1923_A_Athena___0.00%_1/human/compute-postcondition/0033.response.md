To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`.

The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer larger than 0 and at least 1.

To execute the loop one more time, `_` must be increased by 1, so `_` is 1, and `t` must be decreased by 1, so `t` is an integer larger than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer larger than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with all trailing zeros removed, `res` is equal to the number of zeros in the list `a`, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, and the list `a` with all trailing zeros removed is being printed, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, and the number of zeros in the list `a` which is equal to `res` is being printed**
