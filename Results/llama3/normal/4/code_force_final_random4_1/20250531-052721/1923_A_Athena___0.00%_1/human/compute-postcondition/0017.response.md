Output State: `t` is an integer larger than 0 and at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with all trailing zeros removed, `res` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the list `a` will have all trailing zeros removed, while the other variables remain unchanged.
