To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `a` has at least one element. Since `i` is the loop variable, it should be initialized to 0, which is the first index of the list `a`.

State: **`t` is an integer larger than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with no leading zeros and no trailing zeros that must have at least 1 element, `res` is equal to the number of zeros in the list `a`, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `i` is 0**
