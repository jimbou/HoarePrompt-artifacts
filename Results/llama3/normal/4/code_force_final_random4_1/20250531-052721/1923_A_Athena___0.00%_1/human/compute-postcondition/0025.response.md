Output State: **`t` is an integer larger than 0 and at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least two non-zero integers and all trailing zeros removed, `res` is 2 if the first element of `a` is 0, otherwise `res` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, and the list `a` with all trailing zeros removed is being printed, `i` is 1**

The value of `res` is incremented by 1. If the first element of `a` is 0, `res` was initially 1, so it becomes 2. Otherwise, `res` was initially 0, so it becomes 1. The values of the other variables are not affected.
