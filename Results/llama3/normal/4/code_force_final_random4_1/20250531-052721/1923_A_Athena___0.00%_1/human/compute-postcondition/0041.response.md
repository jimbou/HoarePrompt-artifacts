Output State: **`t` is an integer larger than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with no leading zeros, `res` is being printed and is equal to the number of zeros in the list `a`, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, and `i` is equal to the original length of `a`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop finishes executing, the list `a` will have all leading zeros removed, and the variable `res` will be equal to the number of zeros in the resulting list. The other variables remain unchanged.
