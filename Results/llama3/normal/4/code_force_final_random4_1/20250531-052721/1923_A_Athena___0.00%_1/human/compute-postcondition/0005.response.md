To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `a` since it's the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `a` is not empty and its first element is 0. At the end of the last iteration, `a` has at least one element and its first element has been removed. To ensure the loop can execute again, `a` must have at least two elements, and its first element must be 0.

State: **`t` is an integer larger than 0 and at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least two elements and its first element is 0, `res` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases**
