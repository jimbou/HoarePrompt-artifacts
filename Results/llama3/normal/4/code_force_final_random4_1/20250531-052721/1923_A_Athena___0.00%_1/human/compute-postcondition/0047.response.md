Output State: **`t` is an integer larger than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with no leading zeros and at least one trailing zero, `res` is being printed and is equal to the number of zeros in the list `a` minus 1, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, and `i` is equal to the original length of `a` minus 3**

Explanation:
The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Since `a` had at least two trailing zeros, removing one zero will leave at least one trailing zero. The length of `a` has decreased by 1, so `i` is now equal to the original length of `a` minus 3. The other variables remain unchanged.
