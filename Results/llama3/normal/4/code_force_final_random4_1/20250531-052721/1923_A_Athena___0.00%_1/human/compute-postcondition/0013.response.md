The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Since `a` is a list of integers with all leading zeros removed and at least one more 0 at the end, the last element that is removed is 0.

The values of the other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer larger than 0 and at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with all leading zeros removed, `res` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases**
