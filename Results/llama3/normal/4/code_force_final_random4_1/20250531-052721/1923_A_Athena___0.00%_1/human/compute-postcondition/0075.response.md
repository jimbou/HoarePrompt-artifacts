Output State: **`t` is an integer larger than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that can have leading zeros, must have at least `i` elements, and must end with at least one 0, `res` is equal to the number of zeros in the list `a` plus `i-k` if the first element of `a` is 0 and all elements of `a` are 0, otherwise res is equal to the number of zeros in the list `a` plus `i-k-1` if the first element of `a` is 0 and not all elements of `a` are 0, otherwise res is equal to the number of zeros in the list `a` plus `i-k-2` if the first element of `a` is not 0 and the second element of `a` is 0, otherwise res is equal to the number of zeros in the list `a` plus `i-k-3` if the first element of `a` is not 0 and the second element of `a` is not 0 and the third element of `a` is 0, and so on, `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases, and `i` is equal to the original length of `a` minus the number of trailing zeros in the original list `a`, and the value of `res` is printed, and the last element of `a` has been removed.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the last element of the list `a` has been removed. The values of the other variables remain the same.
