To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of `a` so that it still has at least one element and its last element is 0.

State: **`t` is an integer larger than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with no leading zeros and at least two trailing zeros, `res` is being printed and is equal to the number of zeros in the list `a` minus 1, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, and `i` is equal to the original length of `a` minus 2**
