To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `a`. If `i` is less than the length of `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `a` has at least one non-zero integer and all trailing zeros removed.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The length of `a` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is an integer larger than 0 and at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least two non-zero integers and all trailing zeros removed, `res` is 1 if the first element of `a` is 0, otherwise `res` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, and the list `a` with all trailing zeros removed is being printed, `i` is 1**
