Output State: **`t` is an integer larger than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with no leading zeros and no trailing zeros that must have at least 1 element, `res` is equal to the number of zeros in the list `a` plus 1, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `i` is 0, and the current value of `a[i]` is 0**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `res` has been incremented by 1, and it now equals the number of zeros in the list `a` plus 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
