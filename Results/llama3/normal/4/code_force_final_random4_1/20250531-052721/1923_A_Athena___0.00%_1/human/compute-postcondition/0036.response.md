The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `a`. Since `a` is a non-empty list of integers starting with 0, the first element is 0. The length of `a` is `i`, so after removing the first element, the length of `a` becomes `i-1`. The number of zeros in the list `a` is `res`, and since we removed one zero, the new number of zeros is `res-1`.

The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains `t-4` test cases.

Output State: **`t` is an integer larger than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with length `i-1`, `res` is being printed and is equal to the number of zeros in the list `a` which is `res-1`, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, and `i` is equal to the length of `a` plus one.**
