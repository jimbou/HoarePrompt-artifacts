Output State: **`t` is an integer larger than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with no leading zeros and no trailing zeros that must have at least 2 elements, `res` is equal to the number of zeros in the list `a` plus 2 if the first element of `a` is 0, otherwise `res` is equal to the number of zeros in the list `a` plus 1, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, and `i` is 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `res` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` still has no leading zeros and no trailing zeros and must have at least 2 elements. The number of test cases in `stdin` is still `t-4`. The value of `i` is still 1.
