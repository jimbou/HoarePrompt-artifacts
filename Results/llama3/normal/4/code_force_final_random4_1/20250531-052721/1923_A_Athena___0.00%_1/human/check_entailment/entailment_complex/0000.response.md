Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of moving chips in a ribbon to form a single block without any free cells between them. The program reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the number of free cells (containing 0) in each test case.

The program correctly trims leading and trailing free cells from the list of cells, which is necessary to find the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block. It then counts and prints the number of remaining free cells, which represents the minimum number of operations needed.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the required steps to solve the problem. It handles the input correctly, processes the data as needed, and produces the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
