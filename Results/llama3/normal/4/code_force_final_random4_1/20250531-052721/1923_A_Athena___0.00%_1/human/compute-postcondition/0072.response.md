Output State: **`t` is an integer larger than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that can have leading zeros, must have at least `i` elements, and the first element of `a` is either 0 or not 0 depending on the previous first element of `a` and the number of zeros in the list `a` plus `i-2` if the first element of `a` is 0 and all elements of `a` are 0, otherwise `res` is equal to the number of zeros in the list `a` plus `i-3` if the first element of `a` is 0 and not all elements of `a` are 0, otherwise `res` is equal to the number of zeros in the list `a` plus `i-4` if the first element of `a` is not 0 and the second element of `a` is 0, otherwise `res` is equal to the number of zeros in the list `a` plus `i-5` if the first element of `a` is not 0 and the second element of `a` is not 0 and the third element of `a` is 0, and so on, `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases, and `i` is equal to the original length of `a` minus the number of trailing zeros in the original list `a`, and the value of `res` is printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still an integer larger than 1, and the value of `_` is still 2. The value of `n` is still an integer. The list `a` has been modified by removing its first element. The first element of `a` is now either 0 or not 0, depending on the previous first element of `a`. The value of `res` is still equal to the number of zeros in the list `a` plus `i-2` if the first element of `a` is 0 and all elements of `a` are 0, otherwise `res` is equal to the number of zeros in the list `a` plus `i-3` if the first element of `a` is 0 and not all elements of `a` are 0, otherwise `res` is equal to the number of zeros in the list `a` plus `i-4` if the first element of `a` is not 0 and the second element of `a` is 0, otherwise `res` is equal to the number of zeros in the list `a` plus `i-5` if the first element of `a` is not 0 and the second element of `a` is not 0 and the third element of `a` is 0, and so on. The number of test cases in `stdin` is still `t-6`, and the value of `i` is still equal to the original length of `a` minus the number of trailing zeros in the original list `a`. The value of `res` is still printed.
