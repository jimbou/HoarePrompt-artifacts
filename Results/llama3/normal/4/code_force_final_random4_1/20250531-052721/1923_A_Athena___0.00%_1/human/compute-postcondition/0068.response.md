Output State: **`t` is an integer larger than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that can have leading zeros and must have at least `i-1` elements, `res` is equal to the number of zeros in the list `a` plus `i-1` if the first element of `a` is 0 and all elements of `a` are 0, otherwise `res` is equal to the number of zeros in the list `a` plus `i-2` if the first element of `a` is 0 and not all elements of `a` are 0, otherwise `res` is equal to the number of zeros in the list `a` plus `i-3` if the first element of `a` is not 0 and the second element of `a` is 0, otherwise `res` is equal to the number of zeros in the list `a` plus `i-4` if the first element of `a` is not 0 and the second element of `a` is not 0 and the third element of `a` is 0, and so on, `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases, and `i` is equal to the original length of `a` minus the number of trailing zeros in the original list `a`, and the value of `res` is printed.**

In this output state, the list `a` has been modified by removing its first element, and the value of `i` has been implicitly updated to be one less than its original value, since the length of `a` has decreased by one. The other variables remain unchanged.
