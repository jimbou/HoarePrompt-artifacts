Output State: **`t` is an integer larger than 0 and at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least three non-zero integers and all trailing zeros removed, `res` is 3 if the first element of `a` is 0 and the second element of `a` is 0, otherwise `res` is 2 if the first element of `a` is 0, otherwise `res` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, and the list `a` with all trailing zeros removed is being printed, `i` is 2**

The value of `res` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `res` depends on the first two elements of `a`. If the first element of `a` is 0 and the second element of `a` is 0, then `res` was 2 and is now 3. If the first element of `a` is 0 but the second element of `a` is not 0, then `res` was 1 and is now 2. If the first element of `a` is not 0, then `res` was 0 and is now 1. The values of the other variables are not affected.
