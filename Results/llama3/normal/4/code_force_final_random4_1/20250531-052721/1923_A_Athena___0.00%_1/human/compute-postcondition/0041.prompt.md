Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer larger than 0, _ is 1, n is an integer, a is a list of integers, res is 0, stdin contains t-4 test cases, i is equal to the length of a, and the number of zeros in the list a which is equal to res is being printed
Code of the loop:
while a and a[0] == 0:
    a.pop(0)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer larger than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with length `i-1`, `res` is being printed and is equal to the number of zeros in the list `a` which is `res-1`, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, and `i` is equal to the length of `a` plus one.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer larger than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with length `i-2` and the first element is not specified, `res` is being printed and is equal to the number of zeros in the list `a` which is `res-2`, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, and `i` is equal to the length of `a` plus one.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer larger than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with length greater than 0, `res` is being printed and is equal to the number of zeros in the list `a` which is `res-1`, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, and `i` is equal to the original length of `a`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
