The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `a`. The first element of `a` is 0. After removing the first element, the list `a` has at least one element. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin contains `t-2` test cases. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer larger than 0 and at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `res` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases**
