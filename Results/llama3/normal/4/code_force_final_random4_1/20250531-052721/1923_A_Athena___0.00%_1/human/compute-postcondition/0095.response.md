Output: **The value of res which is the number of zeros in the list a plus i-k if the first element of a is 0 and all elements of a are 0, otherwise the number of zeros in the list a plus i-k-1 if the first element of a is 0 and not all elements of a are 0, otherwise the number of zeros in the list a plus i-k-2 if the first element of a is not 0 and the second element of a is 0, otherwise the number of zeros in the list a plus i-k-3 if the first element of a is not 0 and the second element of a is not 0 and the third element of a is 0, and so on, increased by 1 if the current element of a is 0, otherwise remains the same, increased by 1 if the current element of a is 0, otherwise remains the same, plus 1 if a[i] is 0, otherwise remains the same, and so on, until the end of the list a, where a is a list of integers that can have leading zeros, must have at least i elements, must not end with a 0, and is not empty, i is equal to the original length of a minus the number of trailing zeros in the original list a, and k is equal to the original length of a minus the number of trailing zeros in the original list a**
