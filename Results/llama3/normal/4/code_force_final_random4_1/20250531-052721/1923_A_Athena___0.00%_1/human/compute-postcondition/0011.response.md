Output State: **`t` is an integer larger than 0 and at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with all leading zeros removed, `res` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases**

The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`, which was a trailing zero. The values of the other variables are not affected. The list `a` now has all leading zeros removed, but no trailing zero. The stdin still contains `t-2` test cases.
