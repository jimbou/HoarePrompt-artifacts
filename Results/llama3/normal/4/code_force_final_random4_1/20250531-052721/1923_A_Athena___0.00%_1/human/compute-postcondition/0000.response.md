Output State: **`t` is an integer larger than 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) where a_i = 0 means the i-th cell is free and a_i = 1 means the i-th cell contains a chip. In each test case, at least one cell contains a chip.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is an integer larger than 0, which is the number of test cases. The stdin contains t-1 test cases, each consisting of two lines. The first line contains an integer n, which is between 2 and 50 (inclusive), representing the number of cells. The second line contains n integers, each representing the state of a cell (0 for free and 1 for containing a chip). At least one cell in each test case contains a chip.
