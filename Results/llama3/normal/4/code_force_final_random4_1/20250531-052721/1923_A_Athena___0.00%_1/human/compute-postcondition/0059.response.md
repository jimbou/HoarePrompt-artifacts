Output State: **`t` is an integer larger than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with no leading zeros and no trailing zeros that must have at least 3 elements, `res` is equal to the number of zeros in the list `a` plus 3 if the first element of `a` is 0, otherwise `res` is equal to the number of zeros in the list `a` plus 2, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, and `i` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `res` is now equal to the number of zeros in the list `a` plus 3 if the first element of `a` is 0, otherwise it is equal to the number of zeros in the list `a` plus 2.
