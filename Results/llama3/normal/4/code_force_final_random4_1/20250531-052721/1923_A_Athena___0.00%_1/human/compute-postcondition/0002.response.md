Output State: **t is an integer larger than 0 and at least 1, _ is 0, n is an integer, a is a list of integers, res is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases**

Explanation:
The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `t` is an integer larger than 0 and at least 1, `n` becomes an integer. The second line assigns a list of integers from stdin to `a`. Stdin now contains `t-2` test cases. The third line initializes `res` to 0. No other variables are affected.
