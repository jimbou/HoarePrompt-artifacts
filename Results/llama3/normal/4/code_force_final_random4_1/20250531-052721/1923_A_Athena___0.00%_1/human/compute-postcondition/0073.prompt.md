Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer larger than 1, _ is 2, n is an integer, a is a list of integers with no leading zeros and no trailing zeros that must have at least i elements, res is equal to the number of zeros in the list a plus i if the first element of a is 0 and all elements of a are 0, otherwise res is equal to the number of zeros in the list a plus i-1 if the first element of a is 0 and not all elements of a are 0, otherwise res is equal to the number of zeros in the list a plus i-2 if the first element of a is not 0 and the second element of a is 0, otherwise res is equal to the number of zeros in the list a plus i-3 if the first element of a is not 0 and the second element of a is not 0 and the third element of a is 0, and so on, stdin contains t-6 test cases, and i is equal to the original length of a minus the number of trailing zeros in the original list a, and the value of res is printed
Code of the loop:
while a and a[0] == 0:
    a.pop(0)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer larger than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that can have leading zeros and must have at least `i-1` elements, `res` is equal to the number of zeros in the list `a` plus `i-1` if the first element of `a` is 0 and all elements of `a` are 0, otherwise `res` is equal to the number of zeros in the list `a` plus `i-2` if the first element of `a` is 0 and not all elements of `a` are 0, otherwise `res` is equal to the number of zeros in the list `a` plus `i-3` if the first element of `a` is not 0 and the second element of `a` is 0, otherwise `res` is equal to the number of zeros in the list `a` plus `i-4` if the first element of `a` is not 0 and the second element of `a` is not 0 and the third element of `a` is 0, and so on, `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases, and `i` is equal to the original length of `a` minus the number of trailing zeros in the original list `a`, and the value of `res` is printed.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer larger than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that can have leading zeros, must have at least `i-1` elements, and the first element of `a` is either 0 or the second element of the original list `a`, `res` is equal to the number of zeros in the list `a` plus `i-2` if the first element of `a` is 0 and all elements of `a` are 0, otherwise `res` is equal to the number of zeros in the list `a` plus `i-3` if the first element of `a` is 0 and not all elements of `a` are 0, otherwise `res` is equal to the number of zeros in the list `a` plus `i-4` if the first element of `a` is not 0 and the second element of `a` is 0, otherwise `res` is equal to the number of zeros in the list `a` plus `i-5` if the first element of `a` is not 0 and the second element of `a` is not 0 and the third element of `a` is 0, and so on, `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases, and `i` is equal to the original length of `a` minus the number of trailing zeros in the original list `a`, and the value of `res` is printed.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer larger than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that can have leading zeros, must have at least `i` elements, and the first element of `a` is either 0 or not 0 depending on the previous first element of `a` and the number of zeros in the list `a` plus `i-2` if the first element of `a` is 0 and all elements of `a` are 0, otherwise `res` is equal to the number of zeros in the list `a` plus `i-3` if the first element of `a` is 0 and not all elements of `a` are 0, otherwise `res` is equal to the number of zeros in the list `a` plus `i-4` if the first element of `a` is not 0 and the second element of `a` is 0, otherwise `res` is equal to the number of zeros in the list `a` plus `i-5` if the first element of `a` is not 0 and the second element of `a` is not 0 and the third element of `a` is 0, and so on, `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases, and `i` is equal to the original length of `a` minus the number of trailing zeros in the original list `a`, and the value of `res` is printed.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
