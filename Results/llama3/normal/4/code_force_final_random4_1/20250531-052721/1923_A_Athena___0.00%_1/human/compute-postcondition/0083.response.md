Output: **t is an integer larger than 1, _ is 2, n is an integer, a is a list of integers that can have leading zeros, must have at least i elements, and must not end with a 0, res is equal to the number of zeros in the list a plus i-k if the first element of a is 0 and all elements of a are 0, otherwise res is equal to the number of zeros in the list a plus i-k-1 if the first element of a is 0 and not all elements of a are 0, otherwise res is equal to the number of zeros in the list a plus i-k-2 if the first element of a is not 0 and the second element of a is 0, otherwise res is equal to the number of zeros in the list a plus i-k-3 if the first element of a is not 0 and the second element of a is not 0 and the third element of a is 0, and so on, stdin contains t-6 test cases, and i is equal to the original length of a minus the number of trailing zeros in the original list a, and the value of res is printed, and the list a is printed**
