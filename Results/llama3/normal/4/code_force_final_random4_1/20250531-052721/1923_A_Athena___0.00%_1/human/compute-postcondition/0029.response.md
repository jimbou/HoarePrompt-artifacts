Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer larger than 0 and at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least three non-zero integers and all trailing zeros removed, `res` is 3 if the first element of `a` is 0 and the second element of `a` is 0 and the third element of `a` is 0, otherwise `res` is 2 if the first element of `a` is 0 and the second element of `a` is 0, otherwise `res` is 2 if the first element of `a` is 0 and the third element of `a` is 0, otherwise `res` is 1 if the first element of `a` is 0, otherwise `res` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, and the list `a` with all trailing zeros removed is being printed, `i` is 2***
