Output State: `t` is an integer larger than 0 and at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with all trailing zeros removed, `res` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases.

The loop will continue to execute as long as `a` is not empty and its last element is 0. After each iteration, the last element of `a` is removed. Therefore, the loop will continue to remove trailing zeros from `a` until there are no more trailing zeros or `a` becomes empty. At the end of the loop, `a` will have all its trailing zeros removed. The other variables remain unchanged since they are not affected by the loop.
