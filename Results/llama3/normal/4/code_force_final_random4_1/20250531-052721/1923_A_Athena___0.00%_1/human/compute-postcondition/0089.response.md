Output State: **`t` is an integer larger than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that can have leading zeros, must have at least 1 element, must not end with a 0, and is not empty, `res` is equal to the number of zeros in the list a plus i-k if the first element of a is 0 and all elements of a are 0, otherwise res is equal to the number of zeros in the list a plus i-k-1 if the first element of a is 0 and not all elements of a are 0, otherwise res is equal to the number of zeros in the list a plus i-k-2 if the first element of a is not 0 and the second element of a is 0, otherwise res is equal to the number of zeros in the list a plus i-k-3 if the first element of a is not 0 and the second element of a is not 0 and the third element of a is 0, and so on, increased by 1 if the current element of a is 0, otherwise remains the same, increased by 1, stdin contains t-6 test cases, and `i` is 1**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but the value of `res` has been increased by 1.
