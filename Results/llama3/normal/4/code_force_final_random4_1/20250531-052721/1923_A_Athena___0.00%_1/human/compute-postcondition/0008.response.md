Output State: **`t` is an integer larger than 0 and at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element and the first element is removed, `res` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains the same as it was in the initial state, which is an integer larger than 0 and at least 1. The value of `_` is still 0. The value of `n` is still an integer. The list `a` has been modified by removing its first element, which was 0, so now it has at least one element. The value of `res` is still 0. The stdin still contains `t-2` test cases.
