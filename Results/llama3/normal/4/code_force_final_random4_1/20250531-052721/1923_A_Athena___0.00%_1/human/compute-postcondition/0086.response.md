Output State: **`t` is an integer larger than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that can have leading zeros, must have at least i elements, must not end with a 0, and is not empty, `res` is equal to the number of zeros in the list a plus i-k if the first element of a is 0 and all elements of a are 0, otherwise res is equal to the number of zeros in the list a plus i-k-1 if the first element of a is 0 and not all elements of a are 0, otherwise res is equal to the number of zeros in the list a plus i-k-2 if the first element of a is not 0 and the second element of a is 0, otherwise res is equal to the number of zeros in the list a plus i-k-3 if the first element of a is not 0 and the second element of a is not 0 and the third element of a is 0, and so on, increased by 1, stdin contains t-6 test cases, and i is equal to the original length of a minus the number of trailing zeros in the original list a, and the value of res is printed, and the list a is printed, and `i` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `res` has been increased by 1, and all other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The list `a` still has the same properties, and the value of `res` is still dependent on the number of zeros in the list `a` and the value of `i` and `k`. The stdin still contains `t-6` test cases, and the value of `i` is still 0.
