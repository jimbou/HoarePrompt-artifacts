Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5) and must be greater than 0, y is an integer between 0 and n - x, a is a sorted list of x distinct integers between 0 and n-1, present is a set containing the unique elements of a, stdin is empty, i is x, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x-1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x-1] + 2) % n, ans is an integer equal to x - 2 + k, where k is the number of times t1 is not in present and t2 is in present for all iterations of the loop, gaps is a sorted list containing all the gaps between consecutive elements in the list a, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0), and gap is an integer equal to next_elem - a[x-1] - 1.
Code of the loop:
for gap in gaps:
    pairs = gap // 2
    if y >= pairs:
        ans += gap
        y -= pairs
    else:
        ans += 2 * y
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5) and must be greater than 0, y is an integer between 0 and n - x, a is a sorted list of x distinct integers between 0 and n-1, present is a set containing the unique elements of a, i is x, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x-1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x-1] + 2) % n, ans is an integer equal to x - 2 + k + gap if y is greater than or equal to half of the first gap in the list, otherwise ans is an integer equal to x - 2 + k + 2y, where k is the number of times t1 is not in present and t2 is in present for all iterations of the loop, gaps is a sorted list containing all the gaps between consecutive elements in the list a that must have at least 1 gap, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0), gap is the first gap in the list, and pairs is an integer equal to half of the first gap in the list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5) and must be greater than 0, y is an integer between 0 and n - x, a is a sorted list of x distinct integers between 0 and n-1, present is a set containing the unique elements of a, i is x, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x-1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x-1] + 2) % n, ans is an integer equal to x - 2 + k + gap + gap if y is greater than or equal to half of the first gap in the list, otherwise ans is an integer equal to x - 2 + k + 2y + gap, where k is the number of times t1 is not in present and t2 is in present for all iterations of the loop, gaps is a sorted list containing all the gaps between consecutive elements in the list a that must have at least 2 gaps, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0), pairs is an integer equal to half of the second gap in the list. If y is greater than or equal to pairs, y is updated to y - pairs. Otherwise, ans is updated to x - 2 + k + 2y + 2y.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5) and must be greater than 0, y is an integer between 0 and n - x, a is a sorted list of x distinct integers between 0 and n-1, present is a set containing the unique elements of a, i is x, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x-1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x-1] + 2) % n, gaps is a sorted list containing all the gaps between consecutive elements in the list a that must have at least 3 gaps, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0), pairs is an integer equal to half of the third gap in the list, gap is the third gap in the list. If y is greater than or equal to half of the first gap in the list, ans is an integer equal to x - 2 + k + gap + gap + gap. Otherwise, if y is greater than or equal to half of the third gap in the list, ans is an integer equal to x - 2 + k + gap + gap + 2y. Otherwise, ans is an integer equal to x - 2 + k + 2y + gap, where k is the number of times t1 is not in present and t2 is in present for all iterations of the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
