Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an integer between 0 and n - x, `a` is a sorted list of x distinct integers between 0 and n-1, `present` is a set containing the unique elements of `a`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is x, `t1` is an integer equal to (a[x-1] + 1) % n, `t2` is an integer equal to (a[x-1] + 2) % n, `ans` is an integer equal to x - 2 + k, where k is the number of times t1 is not in present and t2 is in present for all iterations of the loop, `gaps` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(x):
    next_elem = a[(i + 1) % x] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0)
    gap = next_elem - a[i] - 1
    if gap > 0:
        gaps.append(gap)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5) and must be greater than 0, y is an integer between 0 and n - x, a is a sorted list of x distinct integers between 0 and n-1, present is a set containing the unique elements of a, stdin is empty, i is 0, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x-1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x-1] + 2) % n, ans is an integer equal to x - 2 + k, where k is the number of times t1 is not in present and t2 is in present for all iterations of the loop, gaps is a list containing one or two elements: if the gap between the first and last element of a is greater than 0, the list contains two elements: the first element is the gap between the first and last element of a, and the second element is the gap between the first and last element of a minus 1; otherwise, the list contains a single element which is the gap between the first and last element of a, next_elem is an integer equal to a[1] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0), and the current value of gap is either greater than 0 or 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5) and must be greater than 0, `y` is an integer between 0 and n - x, `a` is a sorted list of x distinct integers between 0 and n-1, `present` is a set containing the unique elements of a, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1, `t1` is an integer equal to (a[x-1] + 1) % n, `t2` is an integer equal to (a[x-1] + 2) % n, `ans` is an integer equal to x - 2 + k, where k is the number of times t1 is not in present and t2 is in present for all iterations of the loop, `gaps` is a list containing one or two elements: if the gap between the first and last element of a is greater than 0, the list contains two elements: the first element is the gap between the first and last element of a, and the second element is the gap between the first and last element of a minus 1; otherwise, the list contains a single element which is the gap between the first and last element of a, `next_elem` is an integer equal to a[(i + 1) % x] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0), and the current value of gap is either greater than 0 or 0. If the current value of gap is greater than 0, the list `gaps` now contains an additional element which is the current value of gap.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 3 and min(n, 2 * 10^5) and must be greater than 0, y is an integer between 0 and n - x, a is a sorted list of x distinct integers between 0 and n-1, present is a set containing the unique elements of a, stdin is empty, i is 2, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x-1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x-1] + 2) % n, ans is an integer equal to x - 2 + k, where k is the number of times t1 is not in present and t2 is in present for all iterations of the loop, gaps is a list containing one or two elements: if the gap between the first and last element of a is greater than 0, the list contains two elements: the first element is the gap between the first and last element of a, and the second element is the gap between the first and last element of a minus 1; otherwise, the list contains a single element which is the gap between the first and last element of a, next_elem is an integer equal to a[(i + 1) % x] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0), and gap is an integer equal to next_elem - a[i] - 1. If the gap between the current element and the next element in the list a is greater than 0, then gaps now contains an additional element which is the gap between the current element and the next element in the list a.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
