Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5) and must be greater than 0, y is an integer between 0 and n - x, a is a sorted list of x distinct integers between 0 and n-1, present is a set containing the unique elements of a, i is x, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x-1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x-1] + 2) % n, ans is an integer equal to x - 2 + k + gap if y is greater than or equal to half of the first gap in the list, otherwise ans is an integer equal to x - 2 + k + 2y, where k is the number of times t1 is not in present and t2 is in present for all iterations of the loop, gaps is a sorted list containing all the gaps between consecutive elements in the list a that must have at least 1 gap, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0), gap is the first gap in the list, and pairs is an integer equal to half of the first gap in the list.***
