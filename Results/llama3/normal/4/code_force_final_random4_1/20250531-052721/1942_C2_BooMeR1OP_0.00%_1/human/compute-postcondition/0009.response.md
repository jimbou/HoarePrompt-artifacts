Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is an integer between 0 and n - x, a is a sorted list of x distinct integers between 0 and n-1, present is a set containing the unique elements of a, stdin is empty, i is 1, t1 is an integer equal to (a[1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[1] + 2) % n, ans is an integer equal to x - 1 if t1 is not in present and t2 is in present, otherwise ans is an integer equal to x - 2 + 1.***
