Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an integer between 0 and n - x, `a` is a sorted list of x distinct integers between 0 and n-1, `present` is a set containing the unique elements of `a`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 0, `t1` is an integer equal to (a[0] + 1) % n, `t2` is an integer equal to (a[0] + 2) % n. If `t1` is not in `present` and `t2` is in `present`, then `ans` is an integer equal to x - 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains an integer equal to x - 2.***
