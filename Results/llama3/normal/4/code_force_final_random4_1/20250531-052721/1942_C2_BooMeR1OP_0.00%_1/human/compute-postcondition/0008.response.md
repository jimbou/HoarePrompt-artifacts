Output State: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an integer between 0 and n - x, `a` is a sorted list of x distinct integers between 0 and n-1, `present` is a set containing the unique elements of `a`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1, `t1` is an integer equal to (a[1] + 1) % n, `t2` is an integer equal to (a[1] + 2) % n, `ans` is an integer equal to x - 1 if t1 is not in present and t2 is in present, otherwise ans is an integer equal to x - 2 + 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is now either `x - 1 + 1` if `t1` is not in `present` and `t2` is in `present`, or `x - 2 + 1` otherwise.
