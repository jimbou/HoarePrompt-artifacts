Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5) and must be greater than 0, y is an integer between 0 and n - x, a is a sorted list of x distinct integers between 0 and n-1, present is a set containing the unique elements of a, stdin is empty, i is 0, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x-1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x-1] + 2) % n, ans is an integer equal to x - 2 + k, where k is the number of times t1 is not in present and t2 is in present for all iterations of the loop, gaps is a list containing one or two elements: if the gap between the first and last element of a is greater than 0, the list contains two elements: the first element is the gap between the first and last element of a, and the second element is the gap between the first and last element of a minus 1; otherwise, the list contains a single element which is the gap between the first and last element of a, next_elem is an integer equal to a[1] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0), and the current value of gap is either greater than 0 or 0.***
