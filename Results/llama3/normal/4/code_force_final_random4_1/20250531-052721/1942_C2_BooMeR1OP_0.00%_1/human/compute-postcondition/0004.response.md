Output State: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an integer between 0 and n - x, `a` is a sorted list of x distinct integers between 0 and n-1, `present` is a set containing the unique elements of `a`, `ans` is an integer equal to x - 1, stdin is empty, `i` is 0, `t1` is an integer equal to (a[0] + 1) % n, `t2` is an integer equal to (a[0] + 2) % n. The current value of `t1` is not in `present` and the current value of `t2` is in `present`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, so it is now equal to `x - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `n` is still between 4 and 10^9, `x` is still between 2 and the minimum of `n` and 2 * 10^5, `y` is still between 0 and `n - x`, `a` is still a sorted list of `x` distinct integers between 0 and `n-1`, `present` is still a set containing the unique elements of `a`, `stdin` is still empty, `i` is still 0, `t1` is still equal to `(a[0] + 1) % n`, and `t2` is still equal to `(a[0] + 2) % n`. Additionally, the current value of `t1` is still not in `present`, and the current value of `t2` is still in `present`.
