The only object in the loop head is variable gap and list gaps, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the gaps. If the list has at least 3 gaps the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, gaps has at least 2 gaps, gap is the second gap in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 gaps and the gap is the third gap in the list.
State: **n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5) and must be greater than 0, y is an integer between 0 and n - x, a is a sorted list of x distinct integers between 0 and n-1, present is a set containing the unique elements of a, i is x, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x-1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x-1] + 2) % n, ans is an integer equal to x - 2 + k + gap + gap if y is greater than or equal to half of the first gap in the list, otherwise ans is an integer equal to x - 2 + k + 2y + gap, where k is the number of times t1 is not in present and t2 is in present for all iterations of the loop, gaps is a sorted list containing all the gaps between consecutive elements in the list a that must have at least 3 gaps, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0), pairs is an integer equal to half of the third gap in the list. If y is greater than or equal to pairs, y is updated to y - pairs. Otherwise, ans is updated to x - 2 + k + 2y + 2y, gap is the third gap in the list.**
