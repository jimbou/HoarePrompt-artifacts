Output State: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5) and must be greater than 0, `y` is an integer between 0 and n - x, `a` is a sorted list of x distinct integers between 0 and n-1, `present` is a set containing the unique elements of a, stdin is empty, `i` is 0, `t1` is an integer equal to (a[x-1] + 1) % n, `t2` is an integer equal to (a[x-1] + 2) % n, `ans` is an integer equal to x - 2 + k, where k is the number of times t1 is not in present and t2 is in present for all iterations of the loop, `gaps` is a list containing two elements: the first element is the gap between the first and last element of a, and the second element is the gap between the first and last element of a minus 1, `next_elem` is an integer equal to a[1] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0), and the current value of gap is greater than 0.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `gaps` now contains two elements: the original gap between the first and last element of `a`, and the gap between the first and last element of `a` minus 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
