Output State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive that must have at least 2 elements, `start_year` is ((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] + ((1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1] + (( ((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] + ((1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1] + 1) // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2], `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 2 test cases, and `x` is 2**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of tests is still greater than 0 and is one less than its original value. The number of elements in the list is still between 1 and 100 inclusive. The list of numbers still contains at least 2 elements and each element is between 1 and 10^6 inclusive. The start year has been updated to include the calculation for the third element in the list. The standard input still contains `num_tests` - 2 test cases. The value of `x` is still 2.
