Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen, based on the periodicities of the signs.

The program first reads the number of test cases (t) and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of signs (n) and the periodicities of the signs (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n).

The program then initializes a variable `start_year` to 0, which will keep track of the year in which the next sign will occur.

The program then iterates over the periodicities of the signs. For each sign, it calculates the year in which the sign will occur by using the formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. This formula works as follows:

- `start_year + 1` gives the year after the previous sign has occurred.
- `// nums[x]` gives the number of times the sign has occurred up to the current year.
- `+ 1` increments the count to account for the next occurrence of the sign.
- `* nums[x]` gives the year in which the sign will occur.

The program then updates `start_year` with the calculated year and repeats the process for the next sign.

Finally, the program prints the year in which the n-th sign will occur, which is stored in `start_year`.

Based on the problem description and the execution states of the program, it appears that the program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen.

Correctness: **True**
