Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities of the signs `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
3. The program initializes `start_year` to 0, which represents the year when the first sign occurs.
4. The program then iterates over each sign `x` in the range of `len(nums)`. For each sign, it updates `start_year` using the formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.
5. This formula calculates the next occurrence of the sign `x` after the previous sign has occurred. The `+ 1` inside the parentheses ensures that the next occurrence is strictly after the previous one.
6. After updating `start_year` for all signs, the program prints the final value of `start_year`, which represents the year when the `n`-th sign occurs and the apocalypse happens.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement, and the formula used to update `start_year` is correct.

Correctness: **True**
