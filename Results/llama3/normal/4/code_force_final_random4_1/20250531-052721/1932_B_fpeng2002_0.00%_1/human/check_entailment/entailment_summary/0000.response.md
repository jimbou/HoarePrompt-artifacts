Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases (`num_tests`) and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of signs (`n`) and the periodicities of the signs (`nums`).
3. The program initializes a variable `start_year` to 0, which represents the year in which the first sign occurs.
4. The program then iterates over the periodicities of the signs. For each sign, it updates the `start_year` by calculating the next occurrence of the sign after the current `start_year`. This is done using the formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`, which effectively rounds up the `start_year` to the next multiple of `nums[x]` and then adds 1 to it.
5. After updating the `start_year` for all signs, the program prints the final `start_year`, which represents the year in which the n-th sign occurs and the apocalypse happens.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, reading input, processing test cases, and printing the calculated start year for each test case.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution summary, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
