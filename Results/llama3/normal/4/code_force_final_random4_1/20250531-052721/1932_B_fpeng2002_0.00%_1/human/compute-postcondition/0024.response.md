Output State: **num_tests is greater than 0 and is two less than its original value and the original value of num_tests must be greater than 1, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, nums is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, start_year is 0, stdin contains num_tests - 3 test cases, and x is len(nums) - 1.**

In this output state, the value of num_tests has been decremented by 1, making it two less than its original value. The value of n has been updated to an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, which is read from the input. The list nums has been updated to contain n integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, which are also read from the input. The variable start_year has been reset to 0. The number of test cases in stdin has been reduced by 1, leaving num_tests - 3 test cases. The value of x remains len(nums) - 1.
