To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `x` and `nums`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `x` is less than the length of `nums`. At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is 1, and `nums` has at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute again, `x` must be incremented by 1, so `x` becomes 2.

The state of `nums` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop head.

The other variables, `num_tests`, `n`, `start_year`, and `stdin`, are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive that must have at least 2 elements, `start_year` is ((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] + ((1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1], `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 1 test cases, `x` is 2**
