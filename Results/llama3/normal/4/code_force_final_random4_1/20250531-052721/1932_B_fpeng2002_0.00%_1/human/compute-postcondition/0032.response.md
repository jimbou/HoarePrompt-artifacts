The code prints the value of `start_year`, which is calculated based on the values in the `nums` list.

The `start_year` is calculated by iteratively adding the smallest multiple of each number in the `nums` list that is greater than the sum of the previous multiples. This process starts with 1 and continues until all numbers in the `nums` list have been processed.

Since the exact values of the numbers in the `nums` list are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `start_year`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated `start_year` value.

Output: **start_year (where start_year is the calculated value based on the nums list)**
