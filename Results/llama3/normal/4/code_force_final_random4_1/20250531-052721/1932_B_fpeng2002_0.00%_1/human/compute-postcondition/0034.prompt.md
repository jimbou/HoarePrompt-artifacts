Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `num_tests` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, stdin contains `num_tests` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6).
Code of the loop:
while num_tests > 0:
    num_tests -= 1
    n = int(input())
    nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    start_year = 0
    for x in range(0, len(nums)):
        start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
    print(start_year)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, `start_year` is the result of the expression `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` evaluated for each `x` in the range of `len(nums)`, `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 1 test cases, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`, and the value of `start_year` is being printed
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: num_tests is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, nums is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, start_year is the sum of ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x] for x in range(0, len(nums)), stdin contains num_tests - 2 test cases, and x is len(nums) - 1, and the start_year which is the sum of ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x] for x in range(0, len(nums)) is being printed
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: num_tests is greater than 0 and is two less than its original value and the original value of num_tests must be greater than 1, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, nums is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, start_year is ((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] + (( ((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1] + ... + (( ((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] + (( ((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1] + ... + (( ((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] + (( ((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1] + ... + 1) // nums[n-1] + 1) * nums[n-1], stdin contains num_tests - 3 test cases, and x is n-1, and the start year is printed.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
