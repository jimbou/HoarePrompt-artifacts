Output State: **num_tests is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, nums is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, start_year is the sum of ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x] for x in range(0, len(nums)), stdin contains num_tests - 2 test cases, and x is len(nums) - 1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

- The value of `num_tests` remains the same as the initial state, which is one less than its original value.
- The value of `n` remains the same as the initial state, which is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
- The value of `nums` remains the same as the initial state, which is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive.
- The value of `start_year` is the sum of `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` for all `x` in the range from 0 to `len(nums) - 1`. This means that `start_year` is updated `len(nums)` times, with each update depending on the previous value of `start_year` and the current value of `nums[x]`.
- The value of `stdin` remains the same as the initial state, which contains `num_tests - 2` test cases.
- The value of `x` is `len(nums) - 1`, which means that the loop has executed `len(nums)` times.
