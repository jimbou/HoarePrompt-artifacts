The only variable in the loop head is variable `x` and `nums`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x` and `nums`. If `x` is less than `len(nums)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 1, `nums` has at least 1 element. For the loop to execute again, `x` must be increased by 1, so `x` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `nums` must have at least 2 elements.
State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive that must have at least 2 elements, `start_year` is ((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] + ((1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1], `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 2 test cases, and `x` is 2**
