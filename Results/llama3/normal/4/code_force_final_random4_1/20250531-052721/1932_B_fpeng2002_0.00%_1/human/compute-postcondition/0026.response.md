Output State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and is two less than its original value and the original value of `num_tests` must be greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive and must have at least 1 element, `start_year` is ((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0], `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 3 test cases, and `x` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `start_year` has been updated based on the value of `nums[0]`, which is the first element of the list `nums`. The other variables remain unchanged. The expression `((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]` calculates the new value of `start_year` by adding 1 to the current year, dividing by the first element of `nums`, rounding down to the nearest integer, adding 1, and then multiplying by the first element of `nums`.
