The code prints the value of `start_year` after it has been updated for each element in the `nums` list.

`start_year` is initially undefined, but based on the given expression `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`, it seems that `start_year` is being updated in a loop for each element `x` in the range of `len(nums)`.

However, the initial value of `start_year` is not provided, and the expression that updates `start_year` depends on the previous value of `start_year`. Without knowing the initial value of `start_year` or the values in the `nums` list, we cannot determine the exact value that will be printed.

But we can describe the value of `start_year` based on the given expression. The value of `start_year` will be the result of the expression `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` evaluated for each `x` in the range of `len(nums)`, where `x` is `len(nums) - 1`.

Output: **start_year (where start_year is the result of the expression ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x] evaluated for each x in the range of len(nums), and x is len(nums) - 1)**
