Output State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and is two less than its original value and the original value of `num_tests` must be greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive and must have at least 2 elements, `start_year` is ((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] + (( ((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1], `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 3 test cases, and `x` is 1**

The code updates the value of `start_year` by using the previous value of `start_year` and the value of `nums[x]`, which is `nums[1]`. The new value of `start_year` is calculated by adding 1 to the previous value of `start_year`, dividing it by `nums[1]`, rounding down to the nearest integer, adding 1, and then multiplying by `nums[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
