Output State: **num_tests is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, nums is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, start_year is 0, stdin contains num_tests - 1 test cases.**

The code starts by decrementing `num_tests` by 1, reducing its value by 1. The second line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`, which is now an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive. The third line reads a list of `n` integers from stdin, separated by spaces, and assigns it to `nums`. The list `nums` now contains `n` integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive. The fourth line initializes `start_year` to 0. 

After executing the code, `num_tests` has been decremented by 1, `n` has been assigned a value from stdin, `nums` has been assigned a list of integers from stdin, and `start_year` has been initialized to 0. Stdin now contains `num_tests - 1` test cases.
