To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `x` and `nums`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `nums` has at least one element. Since `x` is the loop variable, it should be initialized to the first index of `nums`, which is 0.

State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive that must have at least 1 element, `start_year` is 0, `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 2 test cases, and `x` is 0**
