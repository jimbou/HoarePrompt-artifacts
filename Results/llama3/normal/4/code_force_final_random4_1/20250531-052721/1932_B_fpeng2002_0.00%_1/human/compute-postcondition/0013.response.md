Output State: **num_tests is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, nums is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, start_year is 0, stdin contains num_tests - 2 test cases, and x is still len(nums) - 1.**

The code first decrements `num_tests` by 1, reducing its value. Then, it reads an integer from `stdin` and assigns it to `n`, which is now an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive. The next line reads a list of `n` integers from `stdin`, separated by spaces, and assigns it to `nums`. Since `n` is between 1 and 100, and each integer in `nums` is between 1 and 10^6, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive. The value of `start_year` is reset to 0. The value of `x` remains unchanged, still equal to `len(nums) - 1`. The number of test cases in `stdin` is reduced by 2, as two inputs have been read.
