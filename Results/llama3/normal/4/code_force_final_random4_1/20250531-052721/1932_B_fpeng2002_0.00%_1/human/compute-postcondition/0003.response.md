To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `x` and `nums`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `nums`. If `nums` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute.

Since `nums` is a list of `n` integers, and `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, we can conclude that `nums` must have at least 1 element.

At the start of the loop, `x` should be 0, which is the first index of the `nums` list.

The other variables, `num_tests`, `n`, and `start_year`, are not directly related to the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive that must have at least 1 element, `start_year` is 0, `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 1 test cases, `x` is 0**
