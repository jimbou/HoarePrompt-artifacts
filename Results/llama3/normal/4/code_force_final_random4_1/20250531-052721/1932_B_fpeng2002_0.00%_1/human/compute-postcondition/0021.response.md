The code prints the value of `start_year`, which is the sum of ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x] for x in range(0, len(nums)).
Since the exact values of `start_year` and `nums` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `start_year`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated `start_year`.
Output: **start_year (where start_year is the sum of ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x] for x in range(0, len(nums)))**
