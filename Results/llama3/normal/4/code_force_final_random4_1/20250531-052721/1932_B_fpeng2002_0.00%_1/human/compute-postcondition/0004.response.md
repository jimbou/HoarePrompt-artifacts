Output State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive that must have at least 1 element, `start_year` is ((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0], `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 1 test cases, `x` is 0**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of tests, the number of elements in the list, the list of numbers, the number of test cases in stdin, and the value of x remain unchanged. The start year is updated to a new value based on the first element of the list of numbers.
