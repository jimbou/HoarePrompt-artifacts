To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `x` and `nums`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `nums`. If `nums` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute.

State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and is two less than its original value and the original value of `num_tests` must be greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive and must have at least 1 element, `start_year` is 0, `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 3 test cases, and `x` is 0**
