Output State: **num_tests is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, nums is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, start_year is the result of the expression ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x] evaluated for each x in the range of len(nums) for all test cases, stdin is empty, and x is len(nums) - 1 for the last test case.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the number of test cases (num_tests) will be 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The variables n and nums will retain their last values from the input, representing the number of integers and the list of integers in the last test case, respectively. The variable start_year will hold the final result of the calculation for the last test case. The standard input (stdin) will be empty, as all test cases will have been read and processed. The variable x will be equal to the last index of the list nums, which is len(nums) - 1.
