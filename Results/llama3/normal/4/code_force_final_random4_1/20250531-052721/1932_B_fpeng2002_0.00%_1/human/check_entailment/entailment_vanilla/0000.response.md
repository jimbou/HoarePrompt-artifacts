Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen. The program takes the number of test cases, the number of signs, and the periodicities of the signs as input.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of signs (n) and the periodicities of the signs (nums).
3. It initializes a variable `start_year` to 0, which represents the current year.
4. It iterates over the periodicities of the signs. For each sign, it calculates the next occurrence of the sign by dividing the current year plus one by the periodicity of the sign, rounding up to the nearest integer, and then multiplying by the periodicity. This effectively calculates the next year in which the sign will occur.
5. It updates the `start_year` variable with the calculated next occurrence of the sign.
6. After iterating over all signs, it prints the final value of `start_year`, which represents the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen.

The program's logic is correct, and it accurately implements the problem's requirements. The use of integer division and multiplication ensures that the calculations are performed correctly, even when dealing with large numbers.

Correctness: **True**
