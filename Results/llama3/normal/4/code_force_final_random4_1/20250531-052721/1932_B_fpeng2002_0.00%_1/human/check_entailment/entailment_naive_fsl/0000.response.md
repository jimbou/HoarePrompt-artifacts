Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates through the list of sign periodicities, updating the start year for each sign to be the next multiple of the sign's periodicity after the previous sign's start year. This ensures that each sign occurs sequentially, as required by the problem statement.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* When the number of signs is 1, the program correctly outputs the periodicity of the single sign.
* When the number of signs is greater than 1, the program correctly updates the start year for each sign based on the previous sign's start year.
* When the periodicities of the signs are different, the program correctly handles the different periodicities and updates the start year accordingly.
* When the periodicities of the signs are the same, the program correctly handles the case where the signs occur at the same time.

The program also handles edge cases correctly, such as when the input contains large numbers or when the number of signs is large.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement.
