Output State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive that must have at least 2 elements, `start_year` is ((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] + ((1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1] + (( ((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] + ((1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1] + 1) // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2], `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 1 test cases, `x` is 2**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of tests is between 0 and 999, the number of elements in the list is between 1 and 100, the list contains integers between 1 and 10^6, and must have at least 2 elements. The start year is calculated based on the first three elements of the list, and the standard input contains one less test case than the initial number of tests. The value of x remains 2.
