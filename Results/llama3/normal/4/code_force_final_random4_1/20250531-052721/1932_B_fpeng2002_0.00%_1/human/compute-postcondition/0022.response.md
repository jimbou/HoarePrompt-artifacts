Output: **num_tests is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, nums is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, start_year is the sum of ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x] for x in range(0, len(nums)), stdin contains num_tests - 2 test cases, and x is len(nums) - 1, and the start_year which is the sum of ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x] for x in range(0, len(nums)) is being printed**
