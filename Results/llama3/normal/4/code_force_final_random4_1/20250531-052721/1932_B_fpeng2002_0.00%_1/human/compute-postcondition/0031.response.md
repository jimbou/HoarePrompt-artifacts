Output State: **num_tests is greater than 0 and is two less than its original value and the original value of num_tests must be greater than 1, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, nums is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, start_year is ((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] + (( ((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1] + ... + (( ((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] + (( ((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1] + ... + (( ((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] + (( ((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1] + ... + 1) // nums[n-1] + 1) * nums[n-1], stdin contains num_tests - 3 test cases, and x is n-1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: The number of tests is greater than 0 and is two less than its original value, and the original value of the number of tests must be greater than 1. The number of elements in the list 'nums' is between 1 and 100 inclusive, and each element in 'nums' is an integer between 1 and 10^6 inclusive. The 'start_year' is calculated by iteratively applying the formula ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x] for each element in 'nums'. The standard input contains the number of tests minus 3 test cases. The variable 'x' is equal to the number of elements in 'nums' minus 1.
