Output State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and is two less than its original value and the original value of `num_tests` must be greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive and must have at least 2 elements, `start_year` is ((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] + (( ((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1] + (( ((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] + (( ((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1] + 1) // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2], `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 3 test cases, and `x` is 2**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of tests is still greater than 0 and is two less than its original value, which must be greater than 1. The value of n remains an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive. The list of numbers, nums, still contains n integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive and has at least 2 elements. The start year has been updated to be ((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] + (( ((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1] + (( ((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] + (( ((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1] + 1) // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2]. The standard input still contains num_tests - 3 test cases. The value of x remains 2.
