The variable in the loop head is variable num_tests, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable num_tests.  If num_tests is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, num_tests is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive, So for the loop to be executed one more time num_tests must be greater than 0.
State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, `start_year` is the result of the expression `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` evaluated for each `x` in the range of `len(nums)`, `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 1 test cases, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`, and the value of `start_year` is being printed**
