Output State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, `start_year` is the result of the expression `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` evaluated for each `x` in the range of `len(nums)`, `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 1 test cases, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that `num_tests` and `n` remain unchanged, `nums` is still a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, `start_year` is the result of repeatedly applying the expression `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` for each element `x` in `nums`, `stdin` still contains `num_tests` - 1 test cases, and `x` is now equal to the last index of `nums` (i.e., `len(nums) - 1`).
