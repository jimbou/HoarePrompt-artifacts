Output State: **`coord` is a sorted list containing four tuples of two integers, `res` is the square root of the product of the squared distances between the first and second points and the third and fourth points, `p1` is the squared distance between the first and second points, `p2` is the squared distance between the third and fourth points, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, stdin is empty, and the rounded value of `res` is being printed, `n` is decreased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of coordinates, the result, the squared distances between points, and the index remain the same. The value of `n` is decreased by 1, but it is still greater than 0. The standard input is still empty, and the rounded value of the result is still being printed.
