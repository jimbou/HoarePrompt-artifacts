Output State: **coord is a sorted list containing four tuples of two integers, res is the square root of the product of the squared distances between the first and second points and the third and fourth points, p1 is the squared distance between the first and second points, p2 is the squared distance between the third and fourth points, i is 3, n is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, stdin is empty**

In this final state, the list `coord` has been sorted in ascending order based on the values of its tuples. The variable `p1` now holds the squared distance between the first and second points in the sorted list, and `p2` holds the squared distance between the third and fourth points. The variable `res` has been updated to be the square root of the product of `p1` and `p2`, which represents the geometric mean of the distances between the points. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and the stdin remains empty.
