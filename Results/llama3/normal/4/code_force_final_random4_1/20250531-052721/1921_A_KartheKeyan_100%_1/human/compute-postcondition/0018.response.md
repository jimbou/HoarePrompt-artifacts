To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(4):`. The only variable in the loop head is `i`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. If `i` is less than 4, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than 4. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`coord` is a list containing one tuple of two integers, `res` is 0, `i` is less than 5, `stdin` contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers, `n` is greater than 0, and the rounded value of `res` is being printed.**

Note that only the state of `i` is adjusted, as it is the only variable in the loop head. The other variables (`coord`, `res`, `stdin`, `n`) remain unchanged.
