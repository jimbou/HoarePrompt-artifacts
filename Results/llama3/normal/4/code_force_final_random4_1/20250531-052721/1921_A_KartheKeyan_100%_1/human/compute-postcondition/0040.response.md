Output State: **`coord` is a sorted list containing four tuples of two integers, `res` is the square root of the product of the squared distances between the first and second points and the third and fourth points, `p1` is the squared distance between the first and second points, `p2` is the squared distance between the third and fourth points, `i` is 3, `n` is 0, stdin is empty, and the rounded value of `res` is being printed.**

The loop has finished executing all its iterations. The list `coord` contains four tuples of two integers, sorted in ascending order. The variable `res` holds the square root of the product of the squared distances between the first and second points and the third and fourth points. The variables `p1` and `p2` hold the squared distances between the first and second points and the third and fourth points, respectively. The variable `i` has reached 3, indicating that the loop has completed its last iteration. The variable `n` has been decremented to 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing all its iterations. The standard input `stdin` is empty, and the rounded value of `res` is being printed.
