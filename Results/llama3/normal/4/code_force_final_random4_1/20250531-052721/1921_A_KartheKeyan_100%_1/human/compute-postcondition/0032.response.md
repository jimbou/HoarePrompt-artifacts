Output State: **coord is a list containing two tuples of two integers, res is 0, p1 is the squared distance between the first and second points, p2 is the squared distance between the third and fourth points, i is 1, n is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, stdin is empty**

The code block reads two integers from the input, assigns them to the variables x and y, and appends a tuple of these two integers to the list coord. The initial state of coord is a list containing one tuple of two integers, so after the execution of the code, coord will contain two tuples of two integers. The values of res, p1, p2, i, and n remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The stdin is empty after the execution of the code as it has been read.
