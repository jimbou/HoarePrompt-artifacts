The only variable in the loop head is variable n, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable n. If n is not zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is not mentioned, so for the loop to be executed one more time n must be greater than 0.
State: **`coord` is a list containing four tuples with two integer values, sorted in ascending order, `res` is the square root of the product of the squared distances between the first and second points and the third and fourth points, `i` is 2, stdin is empty, and the rounded value of `res` is being printed, and n is greater than 0**
