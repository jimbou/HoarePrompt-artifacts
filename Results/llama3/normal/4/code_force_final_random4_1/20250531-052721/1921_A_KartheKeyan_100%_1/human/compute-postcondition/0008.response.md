Output State: **coord is a list containing three tuples with two integer values, res is 0, i is 2, stdin is empty**

In this final state, the list `coord` has been modified to include a new tuple containing the two integer values `x` and `y` that were input from `stdin`. The values of `res` and `i` remain unchanged, as they were not affected by the code. The `stdin` is now empty, as the input operation has consumed the input values.
