Output State: **coord is an empty list, res is 0, p1 is the squared distance between the first and second points, p2 is the squared distance between the third and fourth points, i is less than 7, n is greater than 1 and decreased by 1, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the initial values of `p1`, `p2`, `i`, `n`, and stdin remain unchanged because they are not affected by the code. The value of `res` is updated to 0, and the value of `coord` is updated to an empty list.
