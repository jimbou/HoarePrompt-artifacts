Output State: **coord is a list containing four tuples of two integers, res is 0, i is less than 7, stdin is empty, n is greater than 0, and the rounded value of res is being printed.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `coord` will contain four tuples of two integers each, the variable `res` will still be 0, the variable `i` will be less than 7 (since the loop iterates 4 times and `i` starts at 2), the standard input `stdin` will be empty, the variable `n` will still be greater than 0, and the rounded value of `res` will be printed.
