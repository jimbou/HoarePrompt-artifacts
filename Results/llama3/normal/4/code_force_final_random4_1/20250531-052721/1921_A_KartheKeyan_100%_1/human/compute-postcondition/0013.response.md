Output State: **`coord` is a list containing four tuples with two integer values, sorted in ascending order, `res` is the square root of the product of the squared distances between the first and second points and the third and fourth points, `i` is 2, stdin is empty, and the rounded value of `res` is being printed.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been decremented by 1, resulting in `i` being 2. The other variables, `coord` and `res`, remain unchanged, as well as the fact that the rounded value of `res` is being printed. The stdin remains empty.
