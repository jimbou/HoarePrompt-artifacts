The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `range(4)`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 4, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is less than 7, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 0 (the first value in the range). 

State: **`coord` is an empty list, `res` is 0, `p1` is the squared distance between the first and second points, `p2` is the squared distance between the third and fourth points, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1 and decreased by 1, `stdin` is empty**
