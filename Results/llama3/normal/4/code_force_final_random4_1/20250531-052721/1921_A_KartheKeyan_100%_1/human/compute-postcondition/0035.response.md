Output State: **coord is a list containing four tuples of two integers, res is 0, p1 is the squared distance between the first and second points, p2 is the squared distance between the third and fourth points, i is 3, n is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, stdin is empty**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: The list "coord" now contains four tuples of two integers each, representing the coordinates of four points. The variable "res" remains 0, and the variables "p1" and "p2" still hold the squared distances between the first and second points, and the third and fourth points, respectively. The loop counter "i" has reached 3, and the variable "n" has been decreased by 1 but is still greater than 0. The standard input "stdin" remains empty.
