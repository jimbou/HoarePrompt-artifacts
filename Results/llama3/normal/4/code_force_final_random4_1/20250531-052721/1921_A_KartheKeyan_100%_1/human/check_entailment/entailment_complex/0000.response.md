Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The issue lies in the way it calculates the area of the square. The program calculates the distance between the first and second points, and the distance between the third and fourth points, and then takes the square root of the product of these distances. However, this is not the correct way to calculate the area of a square.

The correct way to calculate the area of a square is to find the length of one side and then square it. Since the sides of the square are parallel to the coordinate axes, the length of one side can be found by taking the absolute difference between the x-coordinates or the y-coordinates of two adjacent points.

The program also uses the `math.sqrt` function to calculate the square root of the product of the distances, which is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results due to floating-point precision issues.

Correctness: **False**
