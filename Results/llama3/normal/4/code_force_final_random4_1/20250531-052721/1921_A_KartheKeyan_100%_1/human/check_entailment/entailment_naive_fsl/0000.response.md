Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input coordinates are not in the order of (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4) where (x1, y1) and (x3, y3) are the bottom left and top right corners of the square respectively, and (x2, y2) and (x4, y4) are the bottom right and top left corners of the square respectively.

For example, if the input is:

3
1 2
1 5
4 2
4 5

The program will not work correctly because it assumes that the first two points are the bottom left and bottom right corners of the square, and the last two points are the top left and top right corners of the square. However, in this case, the first two points are the bottom left and top left corners of the square, and the last two points are the bottom right and top right corners of the square.

The program should be modified to correctly calculate the area of the square regardless of the order of the input coordinates. One possible solution is to find the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates, and then calculate the area of the square using the difference between the maximum and minimum x and y coordinates.
