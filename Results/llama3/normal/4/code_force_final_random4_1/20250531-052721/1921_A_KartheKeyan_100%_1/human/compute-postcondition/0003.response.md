The only variables in the loop head are variables  i. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If i is at least 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, coord is an empty list and res is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 0.
State: **`coord` is an empty list, `res` is 0, `i` is 0**
