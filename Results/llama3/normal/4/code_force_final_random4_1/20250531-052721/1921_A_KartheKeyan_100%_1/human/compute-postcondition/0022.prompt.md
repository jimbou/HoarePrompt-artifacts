Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: coord is an empty list, res is 0, i is 2, stdin is empty, and the rounded value of res is being printed, and n is greater than 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(4):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    coord.append((x, y))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: coord is a list containing one tuple of two integers, res is 0, i is less than 4, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers, n is greater than 0, and the rounded value of res is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: coord is a list containing two tuples of two integers, res is 0, i is less than 5, stdin is empty, n is greater than 0, and the rounded value of res is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: coord is a list containing three tuples of two integers, res is 0, i is less than 6, stdin is empty, n is greater than 0, and the rounded value of res is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
