Output State: **coord is an empty list, res is 0, i is 2, stdin is empty, and the rounded value of res is being printed, and n is greater than 0**

In this final state, the value of `coord` has been reset to an empty list, and the value of `res` has been reset to 0. The values of `i`, stdin, and `n` remain unchanged, as they were not modified by the code. The rounded value of `res` is still being printed, but since `res` is now 0, the printed value will also be 0.
