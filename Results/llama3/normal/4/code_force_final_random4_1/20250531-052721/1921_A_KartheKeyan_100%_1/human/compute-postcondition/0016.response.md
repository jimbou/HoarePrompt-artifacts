The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 4, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is 2, which ensures that the loop will execute, so it does not need to be adjusted. However, we can adjust `i` to be less than 4 to make it more general.

State: **`coord` is an empty list, `res` is 0, `i` is less than 4, `stdin` is empty, and the rounded value of `res` is being printed, and `n` is greater than 0**
