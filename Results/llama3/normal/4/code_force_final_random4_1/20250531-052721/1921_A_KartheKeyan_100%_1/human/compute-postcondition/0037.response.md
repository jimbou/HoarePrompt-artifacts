The code prints the rounded value of `res`, which is the square root of the product of the squared distances between the first and second points (`p1`) and the third and fourth points (`p2`) in the `coord` list.

Since `coord` is a sorted list containing four tuples of two integers, we can assume that the points are ordered in a specific way. However, without knowing the exact values of the points, we cannot calculate the exact numerical value of `res`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the rounded value of `res`, which represents the square root of the product of the squared distances between the first and second points and the third and fourth points in the `coord` list.

Output: **the rounded value of the square root of the product of the squared distances between the first and second points and the third and fourth points in the coord list**
