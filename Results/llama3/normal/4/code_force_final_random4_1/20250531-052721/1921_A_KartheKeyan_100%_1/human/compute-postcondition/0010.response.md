Output State: **coord is a list containing four tuples with two integer values, sorted in ascending order, res is the square root of the product of the squared distances between the first and second points and the third and fourth points, i is 3, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the list `coord` has been sorted in ascending order, but its original contents and structure remain unchanged. The variable `res` now holds the result of the calculation involving the distances between points in the sorted `coord` list. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 3, and the state of `stdin` remains empty as it was initially.
