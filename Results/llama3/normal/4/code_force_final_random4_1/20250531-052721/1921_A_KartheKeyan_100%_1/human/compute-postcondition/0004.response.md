The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`, respectively. The second line appends a tuple containing the values of `x` and `y` to the list `coord`.

After the execution of the code, the state of the variables is as follows:

* `coord` is a list containing a single tuple with the values of `x` and `y`, which are the two integers read from the input.
* `res` remains unchanged at 0.
* `i` remains unchanged at 0.

The input is consumed by the first line, so the input is now empty.

Output State: **coord is a list containing a single tuple with two integer values, res is 0, i is 0, stdin is empty**
