Output State: **n is an integer, stdin contains t test cases, each test case contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i**.

The code reads an integer t from stdin and assigns it to the variable n. Then, it enters a while loop that continues until n becomes 0. In each iteration of the loop, it reads an integer l from stdin and calculates a value s based on l. The value of s is then printed. After printing s, the value of n is decremented by 1. This process repeats until n becomes 0.

The initial state of stdin contains an integer t followed by t test cases, each test case containing four lines, each line containing two integers x_i, y_i. After the code executes, the state of stdin remains the same, as the code only reads from stdin but does not modify it.

The variable n is initially assigned the value of t, which is an integer between 1 and 100. After the while loop finishes, the value of n becomes 0.

The variable l is assigned a new value in each iteration of the while loop, but its value is not retained after the loop finishes. The variable s is also assigned a new value in each iteration, but its value is printed and not retained after the loop finishes.

Therefore, the final output state is that n is an integer (specifically, 0), and stdin contains t test cases, each test case containing four lines, each line containing two integers x_i, y_i.
