Output State: **coord is a list containing one tuple of two integers, res is 0, p1 is the squared distance between the first and second points, p2 is the squared distance between the third and fourth points, i is 0, n is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, stdin is empty**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from stdin and appends them as a tuple to the coord list. Since stdin was empty initially, it remains empty after the execution. The values of res, p1, p2, i, and n remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of n is still greater than 0 but has been decreased by 1.
