Functionality: **The function reads an integer t from standard input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four lines of input, each containing two integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The function calculates the area of the square by finding the distance between the first and second points and the third and fourth points, and then prints the rounded value of the square root of the product of these distances. The function repeats this process for all test cases and then terminates, leaving the standard input empty.**
