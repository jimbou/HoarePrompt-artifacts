The code prints the rounded value of `res`, which is the square root of the product of the squared distances between the first and second points and the third and fourth points in the `coord` list.

Since `coord` is a sorted list containing four tuples of two integers, we can denote the points as `(x1, y1)`, `(x2, y2)`, `(x3, y3)`, and `(x4, y4)`. The squared distances between the first and second points and the third and fourth points are calculated as follows:

- `p1` = `(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2`
- `p2` = `(x4 - x3)^2 + (y4 - y3)^2`

The value of `res` is the square root of the product of `p1` and `p2`, i.e., `res` = `sqrt(p1 * p2)`.

Since the exact values of the points in the `coord` list are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `res`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the rounded value of `res`.

Output: **the rounded value of the square root of the product of the squared distances between the first and second points and the third and fourth points in the coord list**
