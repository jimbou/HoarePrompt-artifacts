The variable in the loop head is variable n, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable n.  If n is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, So for the loop to be executed one more time n needed to have been greater than 1.
State: **`coord` is a sorted list containing four tuples of two integers, `res` is the square root of the product of the squared distances between the first and second points and the third and fourth points, `p1` is the squared distance between the first and second points, `p2` is the squared distance between the third and fourth points, `i` is less than 7, `n` is greater than 1 and decreased by 1, stdin is empty, and the rounded value of `res` is being printed.**
