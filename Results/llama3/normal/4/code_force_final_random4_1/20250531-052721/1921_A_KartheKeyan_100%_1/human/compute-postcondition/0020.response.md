The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 4, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than 5, so for the loop to execute again `i` must be less than 4. Since `i` is increased by 1 at the start of the loop, `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is less than 6.
State: **coord is a list containing two tuples of two integers, res is 0, i is less than 6, stdin is empty, n is greater than 0, and the rounded value of res is being printed.**
