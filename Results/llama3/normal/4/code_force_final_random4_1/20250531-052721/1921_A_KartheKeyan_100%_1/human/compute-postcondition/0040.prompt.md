Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, stdin contains t test cases, each test case contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
Code of the loop:
while n:
    coord = []
    res = 0
    for i in range(4):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        coord.append((x, y))
    coord = sorted(coord)
    p1 = (coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) ** 2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1]) ** 2
    p2 = (coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]) ** 2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1]) ** 2
    res = math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2)
    print(round(res))
    n -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `coord` is a list containing four tuples with two integer values, sorted in ascending order, `res` is the square root of the product of the squared distances between the first and second points and the third and fourth points, `i` is 2, stdin is empty, and the rounded value of `res` is being printed.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `coord` is a sorted list containing four tuples of two integers, `res` is the square root of the product of the squared distances between the first and second points and the third and fourth points, `p1` is the squared distance between the first and second points, `p2` is the squared distance between the third and fourth points, `i` is less than 7, `n` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, stdin is empty, and the rounded value of `res` is being printed.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `coord` is a sorted list containing four tuples of two integers, `res` is the square root of the product of the squared distances between the first and second points and the third and fourth points, `p1` is the squared distance between the first and second points, `p2` is the squared distance between the third and fourth points, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, stdin is empty, and the rounded value of `res` is being printed, `n` is decreased by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
