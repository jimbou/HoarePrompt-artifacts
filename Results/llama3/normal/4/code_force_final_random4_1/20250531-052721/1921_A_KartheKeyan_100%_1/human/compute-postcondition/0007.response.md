The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 4, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2.
State: **`coord` is a list containing two tuples with two integer values, `res` is 0, `i` is 2, `stdin` is empty**
