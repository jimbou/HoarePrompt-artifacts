Based on the initial state, we can determine the values of the variables and objects involved in the print statement.

The `coord` list contains four tuples with two integer values, sorted in ascending order. Let's denote these tuples as `(x1, y1)`, `(x2, y2)`, `(x3, y3)`, and `(x4, y4)`.

The `res` variable is calculated as the square root of the product of the squared distances between the first and second points (`(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`) and the third and fourth points (`(x3, y3)` and `(x4, y4)`). This can be written as:

`res = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2) * sqrt((x4 - x3)^2 + (y4 - y3)^2)`

The `i` variable is set to 3, but it is not used in the print statement.

The `stdin` is empty, which means there is no input from the standard input stream.

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print(round(res))`

The `round()` function rounds the value of `res` to the nearest integer.

Since we don't know the exact values of the coordinates, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `res`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the rounded value of the calculated `res`.

Output: **rounded value of res (where res is the square root of the product of the squared distances between the first and second points and the third and fourth points in the coord list)**
