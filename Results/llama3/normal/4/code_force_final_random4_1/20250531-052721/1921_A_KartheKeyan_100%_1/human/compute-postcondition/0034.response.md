Output State: **coord is a list containing four tuples of two integers, res is 0, p1 is the squared distance between the first and second points, p2 is the squared distance between the third and fourth points, i is 2, n is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, stdin is empty**

The code first reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to x and y. Since stdin is empty, this operation does not affect the state of stdin. The second line appends a tuple containing x and y to the coord list, increasing its length from two to four tuples. The values of res, p1, p2, i, and n remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code.
