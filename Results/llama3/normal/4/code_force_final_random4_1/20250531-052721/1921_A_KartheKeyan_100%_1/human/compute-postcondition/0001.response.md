The only variable in the loop head is variable n, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable n.  If n is not equal to 0, the loop can execute . Rigtht before the loop, n is an integer, So for the loop to  executed the first time n must be not equal to 0.
State: **n is not equal to 0, stdin contains t test cases, each test case contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i**
