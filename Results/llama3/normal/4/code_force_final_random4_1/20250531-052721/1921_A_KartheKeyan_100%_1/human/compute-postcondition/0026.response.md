Output State: **`coord` is a sorted list containing four tuples of two integers, `res` is the square root of the product of the squared distances between the first and second points and the third and fourth points, `p1` is the squared distance between the first and second points, `p2` is the squared distance between the third and fourth points, `i` is less than 7, `n` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, stdin is empty, and the rounded value of `res` is being printed.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been decreased by 1, but it is still greater than 0. The other variables remain unchanged, and the rounded value of `res` is still being printed.
