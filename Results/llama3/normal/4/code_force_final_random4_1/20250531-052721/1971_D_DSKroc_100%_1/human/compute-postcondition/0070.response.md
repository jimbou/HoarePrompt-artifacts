Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 500 inclusive, `q` is 2, `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with a length of at least 4, `stdin` contains `t-3` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with a length between 1 and 500, `i` is 3, `count` is either 2 or 3, `flag` is either 0 or 1.**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been incremented by 1. If the current value of `s` at index `i` is not equal to the current value of `s` at index `i+1`, then `count` is 3. If the current value of `s` at index `i` is equal to the current value of `s` at index `i+1`, then `count` is 2. The values of the other variables are not affected.
