Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of pieces needed to cut a binary string into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string.

The program iterates through the string, counting the number of transitions from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0. If the string is already sorted (i.e., all 0s come before all 1s), the program correctly returns the number of transitions plus one. If the string is not sorted, the program returns the number of transitions.

The program handles all possible cases, including:

* Already sorted strings (e.g., "00000000", "1")
* Strings with a single transition (e.g., "10")
* Strings with multiple transitions (e.g., "11010", "0001111")
* Strings with no transitions (e.g., "0", "1")

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
