Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `q` is 1, `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with a length of at least 3 and at most 500, `count` is the number of pairs of adjacent characters in `s` that are not equal plus two if the character at index `i` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `i+1` in string `s` and `s[i]` is less than `s[i+1]`, otherwise `count` is the number of pairs of adjacent characters in `s` that are not equal plus one plus one, `stdin` contains `t-2` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with a length between 1 and 500, `i` is 2. If the current value of `s[i]` is less than the current value of `s[i+1]`, then `flag` is 1. Otherwise, `flag` remains 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains the same, `q` is still 1, the string `s` remains the same, the count of pairs of adjacent characters in `s` that are not equal is increased by 1, the input strings in `stdin` remain the same, `i` is still 2, and the value of `flag` depends on the comparison of the characters at indices `i` and `i+1` in string `s`.
