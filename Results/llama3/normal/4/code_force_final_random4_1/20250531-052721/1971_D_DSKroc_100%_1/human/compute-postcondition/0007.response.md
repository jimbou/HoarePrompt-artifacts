Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `q` is 0, `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with a length of at least 2, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with a length between 1 and 500, `i` is 0. The current value of `s[i]` is less than the current value of `s[i + 1]`. If the current value of `s[i]` is not equal to the current value of `s[i + 1]`, then `count` is 1 and `flag` is 0. Otherwise, the values of `count` and `flag` remain unchanged.**
