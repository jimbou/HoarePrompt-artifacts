To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `s`. The loop will execute if `s` has at least 2 characters, because `range(len(s) - 1)` needs to have at least one element.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `q` is 1, `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with a length of at least 2 and at most 500, `count` is the number of pairs of adjacent characters in `s` that are not equal, `flag` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with a length between 1 and 500, `i` is 0**
