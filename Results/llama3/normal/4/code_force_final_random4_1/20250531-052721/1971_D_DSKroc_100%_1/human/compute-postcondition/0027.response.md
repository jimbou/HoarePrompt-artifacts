Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, q is 0, s is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with a length between 1 and 500, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with a length between 1 and 500, count is the number of pairs of adjacent characters in s that are not equal. If there does not exist a pair of adjacent characters in s where the first character is less than the second character, then the value of count + 1 is printed. Otherwise, the number of pairs of adjacent characters in s that are not equal, which is equal to count, is printed.**
