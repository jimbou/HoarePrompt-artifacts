Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 3 and 500 inclusive, `q` is 2, `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with a length of at least 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with a length between 1 and 500, `i` is 1. If the current value of `s` at index `i` is less than the current value of `s` at index `i+1`, then `flag` is 1. If the current value of `s` at index `i` is not equal to the current value of `s` at index `i+1`, then `count` is 1. Otherwise, `count` remains 0.***
