Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 3 and 500 inclusive, q is 2, s is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with a length between 1 and 500, stdin contains t-3 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with a length between 1 and 500, i is len(s) - 1, count is the number of times a '0' is followed by a '1' in s. If a '0' is not followed by a '1' in s, then count + 1 is printed. Otherwise, the number of times a '0' is followed by a '1' in s, which is count, is printed.***
