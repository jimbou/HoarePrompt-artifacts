Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `q` is 1, `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with a length between 1 and 500, `count` is the number of pairs of adjacent characters in `s` that are not equal, `stdin` contains `t-2` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with a length between 1 and 500, `i` is `len(s) - 1`. If there exists at least one pair of adjacent characters in `s` where the first character is less than the second character, the count of pairs of adjacent characters in `s` that are not equal is printed. Otherwise, the value of `count + 1` is printed, where `count + 1` is the number of pairs of adjacent characters in `s` that are not equal plus one.**
