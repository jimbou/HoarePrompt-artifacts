Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `q` is 0, `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with a length of at least 3, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with a length between 1 and 500, `i` is 1. If the current value of `s[i]` is less than the current value of `s[i + 1]`, then `flag` is 1. Otherwise, the value of `flag` remains unchanged. If the current value of `s[i]` is not equal to the current value of `s[i + 1]`, then `count` is either 1 or 2.***
