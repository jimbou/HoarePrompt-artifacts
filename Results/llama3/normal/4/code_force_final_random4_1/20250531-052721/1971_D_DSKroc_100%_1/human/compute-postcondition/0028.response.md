The only variable in the loop head is variable q and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables q and t. If q is less than t, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, q is 0, t is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive. For the loop to execute again q must be increased by 1 so q is 1 and for the loop to execute again t must be greater than 1.
State: **t is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, q is 1, s is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with a length between 1 and 500, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with a length between 1 and 500, count is the number of pairs of adjacent characters in s that are not equal.**
