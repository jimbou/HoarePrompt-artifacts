The code prints the value of `count`, which represents the number of pairs of adjacent characters in the string `s` that are not equal.

Since `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with a length between 1 and 500, and `count` is the number of pairs of adjacent characters in `s` that are not equal, the value of `count` will be an integer between 0 and 499 (inclusive).

Output: **an integer between 0 and 499 (inclusive), representing the number of pairs of adjacent characters in the string s that are not equal**
