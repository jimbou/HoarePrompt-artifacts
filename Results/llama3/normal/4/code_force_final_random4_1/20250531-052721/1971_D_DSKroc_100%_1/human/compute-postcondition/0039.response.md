Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `q` is 1, `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with a length of at least 2 and at most 500, `count` is the number of pairs of adjacent characters in `s` that are not equal plus two if the character at index `i` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `i+1` in string `s` and `s[i]` is less than `s[i+1]`, otherwise `count` is the number of pairs of adjacent characters in `s` that are not equal plus one, `stdin` contains `t-2` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with a length between 1 and 500, `i` is 1. If the current value of `s[i]` is less than the current value of `s[i+1]`, then `flag` is 1. Otherwise, `flag` remains 0.***
