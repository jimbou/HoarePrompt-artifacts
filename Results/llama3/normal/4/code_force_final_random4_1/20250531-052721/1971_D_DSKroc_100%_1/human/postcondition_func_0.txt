This function reads a series of binary strings from standard input and prints the number of times a '0' is followed by a '1' in each string. If a string does not contain a '0' followed by a '1', it prints the total number of transitions from '0' to '1' plus one. The function processes multiple strings, with the number of strings specified by an integer read from standard input before the strings.
