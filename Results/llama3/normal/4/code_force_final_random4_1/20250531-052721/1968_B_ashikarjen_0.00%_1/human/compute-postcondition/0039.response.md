Output State: **`j` is equal to `m` or `b[j]` is equal to `a[i]`, `k` is 0, `i` is `i` plus 1, `n` is greater than `i`, and `j` is greater than or equal to `m`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `j`, `k`, `i`, `n`, and the relationship between `j` and `m` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, which means the execution of the program will continue from the next statement outside the loop or if statement.
