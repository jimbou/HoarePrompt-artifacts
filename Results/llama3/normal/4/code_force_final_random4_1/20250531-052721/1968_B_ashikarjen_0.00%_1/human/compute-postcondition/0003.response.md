The code `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. Since `j` was initially 0, its new value is 1.

Output State: **`stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m` where the first character is not equal to the first character of `a`, `k` is 0, `j` is 1, `i` is 0**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `j` has been incremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The input stream still contains `t-1` test cases, and the lengths and properties of the binary strings `a` and `b` are still the same.
