The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is not specified, `n` is not specified. For the loop to execute again `i` must be incremented by 1 and `n` must be greater than `i`. 
State: **`j` is equal to `m` and `k` is 0, `i` is `i` plus 1, `n` must be  greater than `i`**
