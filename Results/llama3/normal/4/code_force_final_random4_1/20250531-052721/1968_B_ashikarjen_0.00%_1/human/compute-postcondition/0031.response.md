The variables in the loop head are `j`, `m`, `b[j]`, and `a[i]`. To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust their states.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `m` and `b[j]` is not equal to `a[i]`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `k` is 0, `i` is `i` plus 1, and `n` is greater than `i`. 

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the state of `j` to be less than `m`, and the state of `b[j]` to be not equal to `a[i]`. The state of `m` does not need to be adjusted as it is already greater than `j`. The state of `a[i]` does not need to be adjusted as it is already not equal to `b[j]`.

State: **`j` is less than `m`, `k` is 0, `i` is `i` plus 1, `n` is greater than `i`, `b[j]` is not equal to `a[i]`**
