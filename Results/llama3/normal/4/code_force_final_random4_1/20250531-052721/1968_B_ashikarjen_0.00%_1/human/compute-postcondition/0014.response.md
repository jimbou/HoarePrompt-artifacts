Postcondition: ***`stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, then `k` is 1, `j` is greater than its original value by 1, and `i` is 0. Otherwise, `k` is 0, `j` is equal to `m`, and `i` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
