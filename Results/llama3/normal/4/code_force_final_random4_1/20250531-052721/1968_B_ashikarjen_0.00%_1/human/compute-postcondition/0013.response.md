Output State: **`stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m`, `k` is 0, `j` is equal to `m`, `i` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables retain their initial values because the break statement does not modify any variables. The only change is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement we were directly inside.
