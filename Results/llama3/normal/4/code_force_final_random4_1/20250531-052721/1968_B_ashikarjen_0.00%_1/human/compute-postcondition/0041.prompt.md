Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a binary string of length n, b is a binary string of length m, k is 0, j is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
        j += 1
    if j < m:
        k += 1
        j += 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, then `k` is 1, `j` is greater than its original value by 1, and `i` is 0. Otherwise, `k` is 0, `j` is equal to `m`, and `i` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`j` is equal to `m` and `k` is 0. If `j` is less than `m`, then `j` is incremented by 1 and `k` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `j` is not less than `m`, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`j` is equal to `m` or `b[j]` is equal to `a[i]`, `i` is `i` plus 1, `n` is greater than `i`. If `j` is less than `m`, then `k` is 1. Otherwise, `k` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
