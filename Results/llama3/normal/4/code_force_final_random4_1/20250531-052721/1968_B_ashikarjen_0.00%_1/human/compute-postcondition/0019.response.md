Output State: **`stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is greater than `j+1`, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m` where `b[j+1]` is not equal to `a[i]`, and `j+1` is less than `m`**

In this output state, the value of `j` has been incremented by 1, so `j+1` is now less than `m`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition `m` is greater than `j+1` is still valid, and `b[j+1]` is not equal to `a[i]` because the value of `j` has changed. The length of the binary strings `a` and `b` remains the same, and `n` is still an integer greater than 1.
