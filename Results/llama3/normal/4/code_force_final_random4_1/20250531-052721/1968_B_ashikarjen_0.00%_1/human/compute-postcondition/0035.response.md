Output State: **`j` is equal to `m` or `b[j]` is equal to `a[i]`, `k` is 0, `i` is `i` plus 1, `n` is greater than `i`.**

This output state means that after the loop finishes executing, either `j` has reached the value of `m` or the value of `b[j]` is equal to the value of `a[i]`. The values of `k`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged from the initial state, with `k` still being 0, `i` being incremented by 1, and `n` being greater than `i`.
