Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Example

    10011
    
    1110
    
    3 3

    3 5
    
    100
    
    11010
    
    3 1
    
    100
    
    0

Output

    2
    2
    1
    1
    3
    0
    
Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains three lines. The first line contains two space-separated integers n and m. The second and third lines contain two binary strings a and b of lengths n and m, respectively.
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: `k` is the number of times `a[i]` is found in `b`, `j` is equal to `m`, `i` is equal to `n`.
    print(k)
    #This is printed: the number of times a[n] is found in b

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from stdin for a specified number of test cases, where each test case consists of two binary strings a and b of lengths n and m, respectively. It then searches for occurrences of characters from string a in string b and prints the total count of found occurrences. The function does not modify the input strings and only outputs the count of found occurrences.

Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
