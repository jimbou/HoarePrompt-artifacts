Output State: `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m`, `k` is 0, `j` is `m`, `i` is 0.

The loop will continue to execute until `j` is no longer less than `m` or until `b[j]` is equal to `a[i]`. Since `m` is the length of the string `b`, `j` will eventually become equal to `m` if `b[j]` is never equal to `a[i]`. Therefore, after the loop executes all its iterations, `j` will be equal to `m`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
