The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The value of `j` was less than `m`, so the new value of `j` is either less than `m` or equal to `m`. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is either less than `m` or equal to `m`, `k` is 0, `i` is `i` plus 1, `n` is greater than `i`, `b[j]` is not equal to `a[i]`.

Output State: **`j` is either less than `m` or equal to `m`, `k` is 0, `i` is `i` plus 1, `n` is greater than `i`, `b[j]` is not equal to `a[i]`.**
