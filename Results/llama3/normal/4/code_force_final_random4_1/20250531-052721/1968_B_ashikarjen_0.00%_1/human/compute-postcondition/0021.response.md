The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` was less than `m-1` and `m` is greater than `j+1`. So the new value of `j` is still less than `m`. The values of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is greater than `j+1`, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m` where `b[j]` is not equal to `a[i]`, and `j+1` is less than `m`**
