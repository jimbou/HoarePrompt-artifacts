The code prints the value of `k`, which is the number of times `a[i]` is found in `b`. Since `i` is equal to `n`, we can say that `k` is the number of times `a[n]` is found in `b`. However, the exact value of `k` cannot be determined without knowing the values of `a` and `b`.

Output: **the number of times a[n] is found in b**
