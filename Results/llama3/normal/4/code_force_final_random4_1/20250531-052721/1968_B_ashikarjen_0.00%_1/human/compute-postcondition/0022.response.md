Output State: **`j` is equal to `m` and `k` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `j` has reached the end of the string `b` (i.e., `j` is equal to `m`) and `k` is 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop.
