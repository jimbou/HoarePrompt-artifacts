Output State: **`stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is an integer, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m`, and `j` is less than `m` and has been incremented by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `j` has been increased by 1, but it is still less than `m`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
