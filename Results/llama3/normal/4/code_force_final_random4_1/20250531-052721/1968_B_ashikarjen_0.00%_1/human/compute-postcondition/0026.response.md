Output State: **`j` is equal to `m` and `k` is 0, and `j` is not less than `m`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `j`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged because the `break` statement does not affect their values. However, the program execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.
