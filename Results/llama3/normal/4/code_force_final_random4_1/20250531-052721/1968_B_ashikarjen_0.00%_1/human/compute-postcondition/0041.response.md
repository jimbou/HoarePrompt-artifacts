Output State: **`k` is the number of times `a[i]` is found in `b`, `j` is equal to `m`, `i` is equal to `n`.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `k` will be the number of times `a[i]` is found in `b`, `j` will be equal to `m` (because the while loop will continue to increment `j` until it reaches `m`), and `i` will be equal to `n` (because the for loop will iterate `n` times). The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body, such as `stdin` containing `t-1` test cases, `n` and `m` being integers, and `a` and `b` being binary strings of length `n` and `m` respectively, remain unchanged.
