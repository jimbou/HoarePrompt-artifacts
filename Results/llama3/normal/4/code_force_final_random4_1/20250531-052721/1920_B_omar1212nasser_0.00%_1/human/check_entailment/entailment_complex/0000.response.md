Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve a game problem where Alice and Bob take turns removing and negating elements from an array to maximize and minimize the sum, respectively. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` reads input from the user, sorts the array, and calls `func_2` to calculate the maximum possible sum after the game. It then prints the result.

`func_2` calculates the maximum possible sum by considering different scenarios based on the number of removals and negative elements. If the number of removals is 6 and the number of negative elements is 3, it returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the sum of all elements minus twice the sum of the last negative elements, then iteratively subtracts the last element and adjusts the sum of negative elements accordingly, storing these values in a list. Finally, it returns the maximum value from this list.

The program correctly implements the game logic and calculates the maximum possible sum after the game. It handles different scenarios and edge cases, such as when the number of removals is 6 and the number of negative elements is 3.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
