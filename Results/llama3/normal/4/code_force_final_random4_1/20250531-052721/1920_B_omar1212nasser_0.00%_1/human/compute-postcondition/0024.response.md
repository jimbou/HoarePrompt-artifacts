Functionality: **This function calculates and returns the maximum possible sum of elements in a sorted list after removing a specified number of elements from the end and considering the impact of a certain number of negative elements. It takes three parameters: the number of removals, the number of negative elements, and a sorted list of non-negative integers. If the number of removals is 6 and the number of negative elements is 3, it returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the sum of all elements minus twice the sum of the last negative elements, then iteratively subtracts the last element and adjusts the sum of negative elements accordingly, storing these values in a list. Finally, it returns the maximum value from this list.**
