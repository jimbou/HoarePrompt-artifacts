Output State: **`removals` is at least 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of non-negative integers sorted in ascending order, the pair (`removals`, `negatives`) is not equal to (6, 3), `pos` is a list containing three elements which are the sum of all elements in the list `elements` minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in the list `elements` minus `elements[-1]`, `s - 2 * n`, and `s - 2 * n`, `i` is 3, `s` is decreased by `elements[-3]`, `n` is increased by `elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]`.**

The value of `n` is updated by adding the difference between the element at index `-(negatives + i)` and the element at index `-i` in the list `elements`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `elements` is still sorted in ascending order, and the pair (`removals`, `negatives`) is still not equal to (6, 3). The list `pos` still contains the same three elements, and `i` is still 3. The value of `s` is still decreased by `elements[-3]`.
