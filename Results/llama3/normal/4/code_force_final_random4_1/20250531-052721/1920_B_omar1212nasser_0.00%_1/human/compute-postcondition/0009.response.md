Output State: **`removals` is at least 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of non-negative integers sorted in ascending order, the pair (`removals`, `negatives`) is not equal to (6, 3), `pos` is a list containing two elements which are the sum of all elements in the list `elements` minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in the list `elements` minus `elements[-1]` and `s - 2 * n`, `i` is 1, `s` is decreased by `elements[-1]`. If `negatives + i` is greater than or equal to the length of the list `elements`, `n` is 0, otherwise, `n` is increased by `elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]`.**

In this output state, the list `pos` has been updated to include a new element which is the result of the expression `s - 2 * n`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The list `pos` now contains two elements, the first one being the sum of all elements in the list `elements` minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in the list `elements` minus `elements[-1]`, and the second one being the result of the expression `s - 2 * n`.
