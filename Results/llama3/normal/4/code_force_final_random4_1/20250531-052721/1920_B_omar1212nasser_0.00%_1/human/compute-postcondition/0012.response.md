Output State: **`removals` is at least 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of non-negative integers sorted in ascending order, the pair (`removals`, `negatives`) is not equal to (6, 3), `pos` is a list containing two elements which are the sum of all elements in the list `elements` minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in the list `elements` minus `elements[-1]` and `s - 2 * n`, `i` is 2, `s` is decreased by `elements[-2]`, `n` is increased by `elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]`, If `negatives + i` is greater than or equal to the length of the list `elements`, `n` is 0, otherwise, `n` is increased by `elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]`.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated by adding the difference between the element at index `-(negatives + i)` and the element at index `-i` in the list `elements`. The other variables remain unchanged. The pair (`removals`, `negatives`) is still not equal to (6, 3), and the list `elements` is still sorted in ascending order. The value of `s` is still decreased by `elements[-2]`, and the value of `i` is still 2. The list `pos` still contains two elements which are the sum of all elements in the list `elements` minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in the list `elements` minus `elements[-1]` and `s - 2 * n`.
