The function reads a positive integer t from standard input, then for each iteration from 0 to t-1, it reads three positive integers n, k, and x, and a list of n positive integers. It sorts the list of integers in ascending order, calls the function func_2 with parameters k, x, and the sorted list, and prints the result. After t iterations, the function concludes, leaving the input variables in their final state, with the product of the result of func_2 printed for t times.
