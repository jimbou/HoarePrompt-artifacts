To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `removals`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `removals`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `removals` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `removals` remains the same.

State: **`removals` is at least 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of non-negative integers sorted in ascending order, the pair (`removals`, `negatives`) is not equal to (6, 3), `pos` is a list containing two elements which are the sum of all elements in the list `elements` minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in the list `elements` minus `elements[-1]` and `s - 2 * n`, `i` is 2, `s` is decreased by `elements[-1]`. If `negatives + i` is greater than or equal to the length of the list `elements`, `n` is 0, otherwise, `n` is increased by `elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]`.**
