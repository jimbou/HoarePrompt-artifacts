Output State: **`removals` is at least 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of non-negative integers sorted in ascending order, the pair (`removals`, `negatives`) is not equal to (6, 3), `pos` is a list containing one element which is the sum of all elements in the list `elements` minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in the list `elements` minus `elements[-1]`, `i` is 1, `s` is decreased by `elements[-1]`, `n` is increased by `elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]`**.

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `removals`, `negatives`, `elements`, and the pair (`removals`, `negatives`) remain the same. The value of `pos` remains the same as it is not affected by the code. The value of `i` remains 1. The value of `s` is decreased by the last element of the list `elements`. The value of `n` is increased by the difference between the element at index `-(negatives + i)` and the element at index `-i` in the list `elements`.
