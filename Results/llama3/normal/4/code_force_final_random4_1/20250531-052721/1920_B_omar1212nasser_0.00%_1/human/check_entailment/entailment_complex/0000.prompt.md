Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Alice and Bob are playing a game. They have an array a_1, a_2,\ldots,a_n . The
game consists of two steps:

  * First, Alice will remove at most k elements from the array. 
  * Second, Bob will multiply at most x elements of the array by -1 . 

Alice wants to maximize the sum of elements of the array while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find the sum of elements of the array after the game if both
players play optimally.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , k , and x (1 \leq
n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq x,k \leq n ) — the number of elements in the
array, the limit on the number of elements of the array that Alice can remove,
and the limit on the number of elements of the array that Bob can multiply -1
to.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 1000 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of elements of the array
after the game if both players play optimally.

Output

    0
    2
    0
    3
    -5
    -9
    0
    -1
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Alice to remove the only element of
the array. Then, the sum of elements of the array is 0 after the game is over.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Alice to not remove any elements.
Bob will then multiply 4 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is
3+1+2-4=2 .

In the fifth test case, it is optimal for Alice to remove 9, 9 . Bob will then
multiply 5, 5, 3 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is
-5-5-3+3+3+2=-5 .

# Annotated Functions:
func_1()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, n, k, and x are positive integers such that k <= n and x <= n, and a is a list of n positive integers.
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        product = func_2(k, x, a)
        
        print(product)
        
    #State: t is greater than or equal to 0, n, k, and x are positive integers such that k <= n and x <= n, a is a sorted list of n positive integers, i is t-1, stdin is empty, product is the result of func_2(k, x, a), and the product is printed, the product of the result of func_2(k, x, a) is being printed for t times

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a positive integer t from standard input, then for each iteration from 0 to t-1, it reads three positive integers n, k, and x, and a list of n positive integers. It sorts the list of integers in ascending order, calls the function func_2 with parameters k, x, and the sorted list, and prints the result. After t iterations, the function concludes, leaving the input variables in their final state, with the product of the result of func_2 printed for t times.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: removals and negatives are non-negative integers, elements is a list of non-negative integers sorted in ascending order.
    if (removals == 6 and negatives == 3) :
        return 0
        #The program returns the integer 0
    #State: removals and negatives are non-negative integers, elements is a list of non-negative integers sorted in ascending order. The pair (removals, negatives) is not equal to (6, 3).
    pos = []
    s = sum(elements)
    n = sum(elements[-negatives:])
    pos.append(s - 2 * n)
    for i in range(1, removals + 1):
        s -= elements[-i]
        
        try:
            n += elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]
        except IndexError:
            n = 0
        
        pos.append(s - 2 * n)
        
    #State: removals is at least 1, negatives is a non-negative integer, elements is a list of non-negative integers sorted in ascending order, the pair (removals, negatives) is not equal to (6, 3), pos is a list containing removals + 1 elements which are the sum of all elements in the list elements minus twice the sum of the last negatives elements in the list elements minus elements[-1], s - 2 * n, s - 2 * n, and so on, i is removals, s is decreased by elements[-1] + elements[-2] + ... + elements[-removals], and n is increased by elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i] if negatives + i is less than the length of the list elements, otherwise, n is 0.
    return max(pos)
    #The program returns the maximum value from the list 'pos', which contains elements that are the sum of all elements in the list 'elements' minus twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in the list 'elements' minus 'elements[-1]', 's - 2 * n', 's - 2 * n', and so on, where 's' is decreased by 'elements[-1]' + 'elements[-2]' + ... + 'elements[-removals]' and 'n' is increased by 'elements[-(negatives + i)]' - 'elements[-i]' if 'negatives + i' is less than the length of the list 'elements', otherwise 'n' is 0.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the maximum possible sum of elements in a sorted list after removing a specified number of elements from the end and considering the impact of a certain number of negative elements. It takes three parameters: the number of removals, the number of negative elements, and a sorted list of non-negative integers. If the number of removals is 6 and the number of negative elements is 3, it returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the sum of all elements minus twice the sum of the last negative elements, then iteratively subtracts the last element and adjusts the sum of negative elements accordingly, storing these values in a list. Finally, it returns the maximum value from this list.
