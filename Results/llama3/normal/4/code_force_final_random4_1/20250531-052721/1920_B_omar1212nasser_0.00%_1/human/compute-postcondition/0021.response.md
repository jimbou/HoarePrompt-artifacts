Output State: **`removals` is at least 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of non-negative integers sorted in ascending order, the pair (`removals`, `negatives`) is not equal to (6, 3), `pos` is a list containing four elements which are the sum of all elements in the list `elements` minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in the list `elements` minus `elements[-1]`, `s - 2 * n`, `s - 2 * n`, and `s - 2 * n`, `i` is 3, `s` is decreased by `elements[-3]`, and `n` is increased by `elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]` if `negatives + i` is less than the length of the list `elements`, otherwise, `n` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `pos` now contains an additional element, which is the value of `s - 2 * n`. This means that the list `pos` now contains four elements, all of which are equal to `s - 2 * n`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
