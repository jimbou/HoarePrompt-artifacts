Output State: **The program returns the maximum value from the list 'pos', which contains elements that are the sum of all elements in the list 'elements' minus twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in the list 'elements' minus 'elements[-1]', 's - 2 * n', 's - 2 * n', and so on, where 's' is decreased by 'elements[-1]' + 'elements[-2]' + ... + 'elements[-removals]' and 'n' is increased by 'elements[-(negatives + i)]' - 'elements[-i]' if 'negatives + i' is less than the length of the list 'elements', otherwise 'n' is 0.**
