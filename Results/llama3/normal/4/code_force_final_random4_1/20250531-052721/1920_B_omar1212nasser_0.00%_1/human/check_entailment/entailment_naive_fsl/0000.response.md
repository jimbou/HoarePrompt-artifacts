Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The issue lies in the function `func_2`. The condition `if removals == 6 and negatives == 3: return 0` is hardcoded and does not make sense in the context of the problem. This condition will only work for a specific test case and will not work for other test cases.

For example, if the input is `n = 6, k = 6, x = 2` and the array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, the program will return `0` because of the hardcoded condition, but the correct answer should be calculated based on the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob.

The correct approach would be to calculate the maximum sum of elements after the game for all possible cases, without any hardcoded conditions.
