Output State: **`removals` is at least 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of non-negative integers sorted in ascending order, the pair (`removals`, `negatives`) is not equal to (6, 3), `pos` is a list containing one element which is the sum of all elements in the list `elements` minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in the list `elements` minus `elements[-1]`, `i` is 1, `s` is decreased by `elements[-1]`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s` is decreased by the last element of the list `elements`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `pos` now contains the sum of all elements in the list `elements` minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in the list `elements` minus the last element of the list `elements`.
