State: **`removals` is at least 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of non-negative integers sorted in ascending order, the pair (`removals`, `negatives`) is not equal to (6, 3), `pos` is a list containing three elements which are the sum of all elements in the list `elements` minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in the list `elements` minus `elements[-1]`, `s - 2 * n`, and `s - 2 * n`, `i` is 3, `s` is decreased by `elements[-2]`, If `negatives + i` is greater than or equal to the length of the list `elements`, `n` is 0, otherwise, `n` is increased by `elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]`.**
