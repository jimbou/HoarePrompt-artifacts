Based on the precondition, we can analyze the code as follows:

* `n` is a positive integer greater than 1.
* `k` is a positive integer, but its value is not used in the calculation of `ans`.
* `ans` is calculated as `n` plus the sum of `(n + i)` divided by `i` squared for `i` from 2 to the square root of `n` plus 1.
* `root` is equal to the square root of `n` plus 1.
* `i` is equal to the square root of `n` plus 1.

Now, let's analyze the `print(ans)` statement:

The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the result of the calculation described above.

Since `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, the square root of `n` plus 1 is also a positive integer. Let's call this value `sqrt_n_plus_1`.

The sum of `(n + i)` divided by `i` squared for `i` from 2 to `sqrt_n_plus_1` can be written as:

`sum((n + i) / i^2 for i in range(2, sqrt_n_plus_1 + 1))`

This sum is a finite sum, and its value depends on the value of `n`.

Therefore, the value of `ans` is `n` plus this finite sum.

Since we don't know the exact value of `n`, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `ans`.

Output: **n + sum((n + i) / i^2 for i in range(2, sqrt_n_plus_1 + 1)) (where n is a positive integer greater than 1 and sqrt_n_plus_1 is the square root of n plus 1)**
