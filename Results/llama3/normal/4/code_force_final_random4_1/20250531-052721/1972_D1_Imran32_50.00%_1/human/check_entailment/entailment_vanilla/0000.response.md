Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. Here's why:

1. The function `func_1()` is called inside the loop, but it does not take any arguments. However, inside the function, it tries to read input using `input().split()`, which is incorrect because the input has already been read outside the function.

2. The program is trying to solve a different problem. The problem statement asks to calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying certain conditions, but the program is trying to calculate something else.

3. The program does not use the variable `k` (which is supposed to be `m` in the problem statement) at all.

4. The program does not calculate the GCD of `a` and `b` anywhere, which is a crucial part of the problem statement.

5. The program does not check if `a+b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`, which is another crucial part of the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
