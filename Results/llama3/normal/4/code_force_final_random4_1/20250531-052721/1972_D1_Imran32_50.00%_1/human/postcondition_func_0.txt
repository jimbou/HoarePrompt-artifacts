Calculates and prints the sum of a series of numbers based on the input values n and k, where n is a positive integer greater than 1 and k is a positive integer. The function takes no arguments and reads input from stdin. It calculates the sum of (n + i) divided by i squared for i from 2 to the square root of n plus 1, adds this sum to n, and prints the result. The function does not modify the input values or have any side effects other than printing the result.
