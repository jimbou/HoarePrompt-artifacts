To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `root`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `root` is at least 2. Since `root` is equal to the square root of `n` plus 1, we need to adjust `n` to ensure that `root` is at least 2.

State: **`stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer, `ans` is equal to `n`, `root` is equal to the square root of `n` plus 1 and is at least 2, `i` is 2**
