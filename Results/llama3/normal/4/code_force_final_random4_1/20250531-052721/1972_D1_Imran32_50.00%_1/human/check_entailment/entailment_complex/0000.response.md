Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem of calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions:

  * 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m;
  * a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).

However, the program does not correctly implement the solution to this problem. The program calculates the sum of (n + i) divided by i squared for i from 2 to the square root of n plus 1, adds this sum to n, and prints the result. This calculation does not seem to be related to the problem of counting ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy the given conditions.

Furthermore, the program does not use the input value k (which corresponds to m in the problem statement) at all. This suggests that the program is not correctly implementing the solution to the problem.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
