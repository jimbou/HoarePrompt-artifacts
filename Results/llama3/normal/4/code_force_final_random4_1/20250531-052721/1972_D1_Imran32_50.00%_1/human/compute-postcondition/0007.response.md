Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is a positive integer, ans is equal to n plus the sum of (n + i) divided by i squared for i from 2 to the square root of n plus 1, root is equal to the square root of n plus 1, i is equal to the square root of n plus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed for all iterations, and the value of `ans` has been updated accordingly. The value of `ans` is now equal to the initial value of `n` plus the sum of `(n + i)` divided by `i` squared for all `i` from 2 to the square root of `n` plus 1. The value of `i` is now equal to the square root of `n` plus 1, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations. The values of `n`, `k`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
