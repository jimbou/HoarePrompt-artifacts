Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is a positive integer, ans is equal to n plus (n + 2) divided by 4, root is equal to the square root of n plus 1 and is at least 2, i is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

The code snippet first calculates the value of `cnt` as the square of `i`, which is 4. Then, it updates the value of `ans` by adding the result of the expression `(n + i) // cnt` to its original value. Since `i` is 2, the expression `(n + i)` evaluates to `n + 2`, and dividing this by `cnt` (which is 4) gives `(n + 2) // 4`. This value is then added to the original value of `ans`, which is `n`, resulting in a new value for `ans` equal to `n + (n + 2) // 4`. The values of `n`, `k`, `root`, and `i` remain unchanged, and `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus one.
