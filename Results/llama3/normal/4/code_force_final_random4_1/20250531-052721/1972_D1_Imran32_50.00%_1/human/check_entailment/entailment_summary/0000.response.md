Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The problem statement asks to calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions:

* 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m
* a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b)

However, the program does not correctly implement this logic. The function `func_1()` calculates a sum of a series of numbers based on the input value `n`, but it does not take into account the value of `m` or the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

The program seems to be calculating a different problem altogether, and the execution summary also mentions that it calculates the sum of a series of numbers based on the input values `n` and `k`, which is not related to the original problem.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
