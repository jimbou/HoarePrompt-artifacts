Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is a positive integer, ans is equal to n plus (n + 2) divided by 4 plus (n + 3) divided by 9, root is equal to the square root of n plus 1 and is at least 3, i is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

The code snippet modifies the value of `ans` by adding `(n + i) // cnt` to it. Since `i` is 3, `cnt` becomes 9. The new value of `ans` is the original value of `ans` (which is `n` plus `(n + 2)` divided by 4) plus `(n + 3)` divided by 9. The values of `n`, `k`, `root`, and `i` remain unchanged. The state of `stdin` also remains the same, containing multiple test cases minus one.
