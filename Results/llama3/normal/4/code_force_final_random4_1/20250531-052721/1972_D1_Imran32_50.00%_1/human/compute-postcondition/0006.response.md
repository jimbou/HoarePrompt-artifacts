Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is a positive integer, ans is equal to n plus (n + 2) divided by 4 plus (n + 3) divided by 9 plus (n + 4) divided by 16, root is equal to the square root of n plus 1 and is at least 3, i is 4, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding `(n + 4) divided by 16` to its original value. The values of `n`, `k`, `root`, and `i` remain unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin has also remained unchanged.
