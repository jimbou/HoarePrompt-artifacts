Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, ans is equal to n, root is equal to the square root of n plus 1**.

The code snippet reads a line from stdin, which contains two positive integers n and k, and assigns them to the variables n and k, respectively. The variable ans is assigned the value of n. The variable root is calculated as the square root of n plus 1. After executing the code, stdin contains one less test case, and the variables n, k, ans, and root have the specified values.
