Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem. The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions:

* 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m
* a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b)

However, the program does not correctly implement this logic. The function `func_1()` does not take into account the value of `m` and does not correctly calculate the number of ordered pairs.

For example, when `n = 10` and `m = 8`, the program outputs `14`, but the correct answer is `14` only when `m` is also considered in the calculation.

The program seems to be calculating the number of divisors of `n`, which is not the correct solution to the problem. The correct solution would involve iterating over all possible values of `a` and `b` and checking if the conditions are satisfied.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
