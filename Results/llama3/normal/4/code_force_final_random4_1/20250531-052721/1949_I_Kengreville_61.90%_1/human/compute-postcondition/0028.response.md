Output State: **n is greater than 1, i is 1, x is a list of length n where all elements are integers from the input, y is a list of length n where all elements are integers from the input, r is a list of length n where all elements are integers from the input, visited[i] is True, coef0[i] is 0, coef1[i] is 1, ok is True if c1 is not equal to 0, otherwise ok is False, c0 is the sum of all coef0 values plus coef0[j] plus coef0[j] plus coef0[j], c1 is the sum of all coef1 values plus coef1[j] plus coef1[j] plus coef1[j], stdin contains a space-separated list of integers minus n inputs, nodes is a list that must have at least 3 elements, j is the third element in the list nodes**

The code adds the value of `coef0[j]` to `c0` and the value of `coef1[j]` to `c1`. Since `j` is the third element in the list `nodes`, `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` are added to `c0` and `c1` respectively. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
