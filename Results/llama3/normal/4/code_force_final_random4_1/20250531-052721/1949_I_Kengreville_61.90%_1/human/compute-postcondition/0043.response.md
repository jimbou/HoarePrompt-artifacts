Output State: **n is greater than or equal to 0, i is n-1, x is a list of length n where all elements are integers from the input, y is a list of length n where all elements are integers from the input, r is a list of length n where all elements are integers from the input, visited is a list of True values of length n, coef0 is a list of integers of length n, coef1 is a list of integers of length n, nodes is a list of length n, ok is True if c1 is not equal to 0, otherwise ok is False, c0 is the sum of all coef0 values plus the sum of all coef0[j] values for all j in nodes, c1 is the sum of all coef1 values plus the sum of all coef1[j] values for all j in nodes, and stdin contains a space-separated list of integers minus n inputs.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated over all elements in the list, updating the visited, coef0, and coef1 lists accordingly. The ok variable is set to True if the sum of all coef1 values is not equal to 0, otherwise it is set to False. The c0 and c1 variables are set to the sum of all coef0 and coef1 values, respectively, plus the sum of all coef0[j] and coef1[j] values for all j in the nodes list. The stdin contains a space-separated list of integers minus n inputs.
