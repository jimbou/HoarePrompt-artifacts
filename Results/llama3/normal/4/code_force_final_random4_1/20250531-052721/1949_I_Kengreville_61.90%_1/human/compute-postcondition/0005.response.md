Output State: **i is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, n is a positive integer greater than 0, visited is a list of boolean values of length n where visited[i] is True and visited[j] is True, nodes is a list of integers with i appended to the end, x, y, and r are lists of integers of length n, coef0 and coef1 are lists of integers of length n where coef0[j] is r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i] and coef1[j] is -coef1[i], j is 0, dx is an integer equal to x[i] - x[0], dy is an integer equal to y[i] - y[0].**

In this output state, the value of `i` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `n` also remains the same as it is not affected by the code. The `visited` list is updated such that `visited[j]` is now `True` in addition to `visited[i]` being `True`. The `nodes` list remains unchanged as no modifications are made to it. The `x`, `y`, and `r` lists also remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The `coef0` and `coef1` lists are updated such that `coef0[j]` is now `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]` and `coef1[j]` is now `-coef1[i]`. The value of `j` remains `0` as it is not modified by the code. The values of `dx` and `dy` also remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
