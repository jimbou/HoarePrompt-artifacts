This function determines whether a given set of points in a 2D plane can be divided into two groups such that the sum of the x-coordinates of the points in one group is not equal to the sum of the x-coordinates of the points in the other group. It takes no parameters and returns no value, but instead prints 'YES' if such a division is possible and 'NO' otherwise. The function performs this task by iterating over all points, performing a depth-first search to find connected components, and calculating the sum of x-coordinates for each component. If it finds a component with a non-zero sum, it prints 'YES'. If it doesn't find any such component after checking all points, it prints 'NO'.
