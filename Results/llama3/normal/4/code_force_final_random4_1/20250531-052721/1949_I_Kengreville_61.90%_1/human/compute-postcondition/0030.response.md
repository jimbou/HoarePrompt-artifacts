Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `x` is a list of length `n` where all elements are integers from the input, `y` is a list of length `n` where all elements are integers from the input, `r` is a list of length `n` where all elements are integers from the input, `visited[i]` is True, `coef0[i]` is 0, `coef1[i]` is 1, `ok` is True, `c0` is the sum of all `coef0` values plus the sum of all `coef0[j]` values for all `j` in `nodes`, `c1` is the sum of all `coef1` values plus the sum of all `coef1[j]` values for all `j` in `nodes`, `stdin` contains a space-separated list of integers minus `n` inputs, `nodes` is a list of length `n`, `j` is the last element in the list `nodes`.**

The value of `ok` is updated to be True if `c1` is not equal to 0, otherwise it remains False. Since `ok` was already True if `c1` was not equal to 0, the only change is that `ok` is now guaranteed to be True, regardless of the value of `c1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
