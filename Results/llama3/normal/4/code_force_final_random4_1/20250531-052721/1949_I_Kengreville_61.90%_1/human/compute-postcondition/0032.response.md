The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `x` is a list of length `n` where all elements are integers from the input, `y` is a list of length `n` where all elements are integers from the input, `r` is a list of length `n` where all elements are integers from the input. If `visited[i]` is False, then `visited[i]` is set to True, `coef0[i]` is set to 0, `coef1[i]` is set to 1, `ok` is set to True if `c1` is not equal to 0, otherwise `ok` is set to False, `c0` is the sum of all `coef0` values plus the sum of all `coef0[j]` values for all `j` in `nodes`, `c1` is the sum of all `coef1` values plus the sum of all `coef1[j]` values for all `j` in `nodes`, `stdin` contains a space-separated list of integers minus `n` inputs, `nodes` is a list of length `n`, `j` is the last element in the list `nodes`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
