Output State: **i is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, n is a positive integer, visited is a list of boolean values of length n where visited[i] is True, nodes is a list of integers with i appended to the end, x, y, and r are lists of integers of length n, and coef0 and coef1 are lists of integers of length n.**

The code snippet modifies the state of the program by changing the value of `visited[i]` to `True` and appending the value of `i` to the end of the `nodes` list. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
