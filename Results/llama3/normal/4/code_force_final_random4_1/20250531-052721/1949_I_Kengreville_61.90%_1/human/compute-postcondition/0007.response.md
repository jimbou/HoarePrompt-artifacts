To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `j` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is an integer such that 0 <= j < n, and `n` is a positive integer greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` is now an integer such that 1 <= j < n. The value of `n` remains the same.

State: **`i` is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `visited` is a list of boolean values of length `n` where `visited[i]` is True, `nodes` is a list of integers with `i` appended to the end, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers of length `n`, `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of integers of length `n`, `j` is an integer such that 1 <= j < n**
