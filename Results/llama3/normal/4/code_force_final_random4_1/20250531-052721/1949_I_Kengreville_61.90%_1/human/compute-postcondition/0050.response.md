Postcondition: ***n is greater than or equal to 0, i is n-1, x is a list of length n where all elements are integers from the input, y is a list of length n where all elements are integers from the input, r is a list of length n where all elements are integers from the input, visited is a list of True values of length n, coef0 is a list of integers of length n, coef1 is a list of integers of length n, nodes is a list of length n, c0 is the sum of all coef0 values plus the sum of all coef0[j] values for all j in nodes, c1 is the sum of all coef1 values plus the sum of all coef1[j] values for all j in nodes, and stdin contains a space-separated list of integers minus n inputs. If c1 is not equal to 0, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
