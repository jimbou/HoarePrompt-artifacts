Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to change the radii of a set of disks in a 2D plane such that disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent, no two disks overlap in a region of positive area, and the sum of all radii strictly decreases.

The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `dfs`. The `func_1` function reads the input, initializes variables, and performs a loop over all disks. For each disk, it checks if the disk has not been visited before and if so, it calls the `dfs` function to perform a depth-first search.

The `dfs` function marks the current disk as visited, appends it to the `nodes` list, and recursively calls itself on all unvisited neighboring disks that satisfy the condition `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2`, which means the disks are tangent to each other.

The program uses the `coef0` and `coef1` lists to keep track of the coefficients of the radii of the disks in the current connected component. The `coef0` list stores the sum of the radii of the disks in the component, and the `coef1` list stores the sum of the coefficients of the radii.

The program checks if the sum of the coefficients of the radii in the current component is not equal to zero. If it finds a component with a non-zero sum, it prints 'YES', indicating that it is possible to change the radii of the disks in the desired manner. If it doesn't find any such component after checking all disks, it prints 'NO'.

Based on the provided execution summaries, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. The `func_1` function correctly reads the input, initializes variables, and performs the loop over all disks. The `dfs` function correctly performs the depth-first search and updates the coefficients of the radii.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
