Output State: **n is greater than 2, i is 2, x is a list of length n where all elements are integers from the input, y is a list of length n where all elements are integers from the input, r is a list of length n where all elements are integers from the input, visited[i] is True, coef0[i] is 0, coef1[i] is 1, ok is True if c1 is not equal to 0, otherwise ok is False, c0 is the sum of all coef0 values plus the sum of all coef0[j] values for all j in nodes, c1 is the sum of all coef1 values plus the sum of all coef1[j] values for all j in nodes, nodes is an empty list, j is the last element in the list nodes, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers minus n inputs.**

In this final state, the values of `n`, `i`, `x`, `y`, and `r` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `visited[i]` is set to True, and the values of `coef0[i]` and `coef1[i]` are set to 0 and 1, respectively. The value of `ok` is determined based on the value of `c1`. The values of `c0` and `c1` are calculated as the sum of all `coef0` and `coef1` values, respectively, plus the sum of all `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` values for all `j` in `nodes`. The list `nodes` is empty, and `j` is the last element in the list `nodes`. The `stdin` contains a space-separated list of integers minus `n` inputs.
