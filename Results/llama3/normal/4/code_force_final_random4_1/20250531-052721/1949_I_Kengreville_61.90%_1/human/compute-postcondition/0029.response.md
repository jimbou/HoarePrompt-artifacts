Output State: **n is greater than 1, i is 1, x is a list of length n where all elements are integers from the input, y is a list of length n where all elements are integers from the input, r is a list of length n where all elements are integers from the input, visited[i] is True, coef0[i] is 0, coef1[i] is 1, ok is True if c1 is not equal to 0, otherwise ok is False, c0 is the sum of all coef0 values plus the sum of all coef0[j] values for all j in nodes, c1 is the sum of all coef1 values plus the sum of all coef1[j] values for all j in nodes, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers minus n inputs, nodes is a list of length n, j is the last element in the list nodes.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows:

The loop iterates over all elements in the list 'nodes'. After the loop finishes executing, the variable 'c0' will be the sum of all 'coef0' values plus the sum of all 'coef0[j]' values for each 'j' in 'nodes'. Similarly, 'c1' will be the sum of all 'coef1' values plus the sum of all 'coef1[j]' values for each 'j' in 'nodes'. The variable 'j' will be the last element in the list 'nodes'. All other variables remain unchanged.
