Output State: **n is greater than 2, i is 2, x is a list of length n where all elements are integers from the input, y is a list of length n where all elements are integers from the input, r is a list of length n where all elements are integers from the input, visited[i] is True, coef0[i] is 0, coef1[i] is 1, ok is True if c1 is not equal to 0, otherwise ok is False, c0 is the sum of all coef0 values plus the sum of all coef0[j] values for all j in nodes, c1 is the sum of all coef1 values plus the sum of all coef1[j] values for all j in nodes, nodes is a list of length n, j is the last element in the list nodes, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers minus n inputs.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except that the loop has iterated over all elements in the list nodes. The values of c0 and c1 have been updated to include the sum of all coef0 and coef1 values for all j in nodes, respectively. The value of j is now the last element in the list nodes.
