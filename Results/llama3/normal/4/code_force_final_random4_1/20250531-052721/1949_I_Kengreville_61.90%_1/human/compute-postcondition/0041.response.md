Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `x` is a list of length `n` where all elements are integers from the input, `y` is a list of length `n` where all elements are integers from the input, `r` is a list of length `n` where all elements are integers from the input, `visited[i]` is True, `coef0[i]` is 0, `coef1[i]` is 1, `ok` is True, `c0` is the sum of all `coef0` values plus the sum of all `coef0[j]` values for all `j` in `nodes`, `c1` is the sum of all `coef1` values plus the sum of all `coef1[j]` values for all `j` in `nodes`, `nodes` is a list of length `n`, `j` is the last element in the list `nodes`, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers minus `n` inputs.**

The value of `ok` is updated to be True if `c1` is not equal to 0, otherwise it remains False. However, since `ok` is already True if `c1` is not equal to 0, and the code only sets `ok` to True if `c1` is not equal to 0, the value of `ok` will always be True after this line of code is executed. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
