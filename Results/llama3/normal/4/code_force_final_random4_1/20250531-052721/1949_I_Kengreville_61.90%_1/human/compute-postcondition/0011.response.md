To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. In this case, the only variable in the loop head is `j`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is an integer such that `0 <= j < n`, and `n` is a positive integer greater than 0.

To execute the loop again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `j + 1`.

The other variables `i`, `n`, `visited`, and `r` are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `visited` is a list of boolean values of length `n` where `visited[i]` is True, `j` is an integer such that 1 <= j <= n**
