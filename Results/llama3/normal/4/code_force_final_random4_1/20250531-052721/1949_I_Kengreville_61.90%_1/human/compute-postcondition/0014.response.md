Postcondition: ***i is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, n is a positive integer greater than 0, visited is a list of boolean values of length n where visited[i] is True, j is an integer such that 1 <= j <= n, dx is an integer equal to x[i] - x[j], dy is an integer equal to y[i] - y[j]. If j has not been visited and the sum of the radii of i and j squared equals the sum of the squares of the differences in x and y coordinates, then coef0[j] is set to r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i], coef1[j] is set to -coef1[i], and visited[j] is set to True. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
