Output State: **n is greater than 2, i is 2, x is a list of length n where all elements are integers from the input, y is a list of length n where all elements are integers from the input, r is a list of length n where all elements are integers from the input, visited[i] is True, coef0[i] is 0, coef1[i] is 1, ok is True if c1 is not equal to 0, otherwise ok is False, c0 is the sum of all coef0 values plus the sum of all coef0[j] values for all j in nodes plus coef0[j], c1 is the sum of all coef1 values plus the sum of all coef1[j] values for all j in nodes, nodes is a list that must have at least 1 element, j is the last element in the list nodes, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers minus n inputs**

The code snippet modifies the values of `c0` and `c1` by adding `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` to them, respectively. The value of `c0` becomes the sum of all `coef0` values, the sum of all `coef0[j]` values for all `j` in `nodes`, and `coef0[j]`. The value of `c1` remains the same, which is the sum of all `coef1` values plus the sum of all `coef1[j]` values for all `j` in `nodes`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
