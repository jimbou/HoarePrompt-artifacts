Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n-1`, `x` is a list of length `n` where all elements are integers from the input, `y` is a list of length `n` where all elements are integers from the input, `r` is a list of length `n` where all elements are integers from the input, `visited` is a list of False values of length `n`, `coef0` is a list of None values of length `n`, `coef1` is a list of None values of length `n`, `nodes` is an empty list, `ok` is False, and stdin contains a space-separated list of integers minus `n` inputs.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if not visited[i]:
        coef0[i] = 0
        coef1[i] = 1
        nodes = []
        dfs(i)
        c0 = 0
        c1 = 0
        for j in nodes:
            c0 += coef0[j]
            c1 += coef1[j]
        ok = ok or c1 != 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is greater than 0, i is 0, x is a list of length n where all elements are integers from the input, y is a list of length n where all elements are integers from the input, r is a list of length n where all elements are integers from the input. If visited[i] is False, then visited[i] is set to True, coef0[i] is set to 0, coef1[i] is set to 1, ok is set to True if c1 is not equal to 0, otherwise ok is set to False, c0 is the sum of all coef0 values, c1 is the sum of all coef1 values, and stdin contains a space-separated list of integers minus n inputs. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `x` is a list of length `n` where all elements are integers from the input, `y` is a list of length `n` where all elements are integers from the input, `r` is a list of length `n` where all elements are integers from the input. If `visited[i]` is False, then `visited[i]` is set to True, `coef0[i]` is set to 0, `coef1[i]` is set to 1, `ok` is set to True if `c1` is not equal to 0, otherwise `ok` is set to False, `c0` is the sum of all `coef0` values plus the sum of all `coef0[j]` values for all `j` in `nodes`, `c1` is the sum of all `coef1` values plus the sum of all `coef1[j]` values for all `j` in `nodes`, `stdin` contains a space-separated list of integers minus `n` inputs, `nodes` is a list of length `n`, `j` is the last element in the list `nodes`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `x` is a list of length `n` where all elements are integers from the input, `y` is a list of length `n` where all elements are integers from the input, `r` is a list of length `n` where all elements are integers from the input. If `visited[i]` is False, then `visited[i]` is set to True, `coef0[i]` is set to 0, `coef1[i]` is set to 1, `ok` is set to True if `c1` is not equal to 0, otherwise `ok` is set to False, `c0` is the sum of all `coef0` values plus the sum of all `coef0[j]` values for all `j` in `nodes`, `c1` is the sum of all `coef1` values plus the sum of all `coef1[j]` values for all `j` in `nodes`, `stdin` contains a space-separated list of integers minus `n` inputs, `nodes` is a list of length `n`, `j` is the last element in the list `nodes`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
