Postcondition: ***n is greater than 0, i is 0, x is a list of length n where all elements are integers from the input, y is a list of length n where all elements are integers from the input, r is a list of length n where all elements are integers from the input. If visited[i] is False, then visited[i] is set to True, coef0[i] is set to 0, coef1[i] is set to 1, ok is set to True if c1 is not equal to 0, otherwise ok is set to False, c0 is the sum of all coef0 values, c1 is the sum of all coef1 values, and stdin contains a space-separated list of integers minus n inputs. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
