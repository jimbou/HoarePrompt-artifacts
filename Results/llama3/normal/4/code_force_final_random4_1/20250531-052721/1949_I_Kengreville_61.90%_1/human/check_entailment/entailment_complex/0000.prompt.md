Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given n disks in the plane. The center of each disk has integer
coordinates, and the radius of each disk is a positive integer. No two disks
overlap in a region of positive area, but it is possible for disks to be
tangent to each other.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to change the radii of the
disks in such a way that:

  * Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent to each other. 
  * No two disks overlap in a region of positive area. 
  * The sum of all radii strictly decreases. 

The new radii are allowed to be arbitrary positive real numbers. The centers
of the disks cannot be changed.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1\le n \le 1000 ) — the number of disks.

The next n lines contain three integers each. The i -th of such lines contains
x_i , y_i (-10^9 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 10^9 ), and r_i (1 \leq r_i \leq 10^9 ) —
the coordinates of the center, and the radius, of the i -th disk.

Output

Print \texttt{YES} if it is possible to change the radii in the desired
manner. Otherwise, print \texttt{NO} .

Output

    NO
    
Note

In the first sample, one can decrease the radii of the first and third disk by
0.5 , and increase the radius of the second disk by 0.5 . This way, the sum of
all radii decreases by 0.5 . The situation before and after changing the radii
is depicted below.

In the second sample, depicted below, there is no way to change the radii of
the disks in the desired manner.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines whether a given set of points in a 2D plane can be divided into two groups such that the sum of the x-coordinates of the points in one group is not equal to the sum of the x-coordinates of the points in the other group. It takes no parameters and returns no value, but instead prints 'YES' if such a division is possible and 'NO' otherwise. The function performs this task by iterating over all points, performing a depth-first search to find connected components, and calculating the sum of x-coordinates for each component. If it finds a component with a non-zero sum, it prints 'YES'. If it doesn't find any such component after checking all points, it prints 'NO'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function performs a depth-first search (DFS) on a graph defined by the nodes and their connections based on the given conditions. It takes an integer `i` as input and marks the corresponding node as visited. If the node is not visited, it appends the node to the `nodes` list and recursively calls the DFS function on all unvisited neighboring nodes that satisfy the condition `(r[i] + r[j])
