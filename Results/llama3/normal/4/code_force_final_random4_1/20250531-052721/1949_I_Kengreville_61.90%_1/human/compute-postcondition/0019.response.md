Output State: **n is greater than 0, i is 0, x is a list of length n where all elements are integers from the input, y is a list of length n where all elements are integers from the input, r is a list of length n where all elements are integers from the input, visited is a list of False values of length n where visited[i] is True, coef0 is a list of length n where coef0[i] is 0, coef1 is a list of length n where coef1[i] is 1, nodes is an empty list, j is undefined, ok is True if c1 is not equal to 0, otherwise ok is False, c0 is the sum of all coef0 values, c1 is the sum of all coef1 values, and stdin contains a space-separated list of integers minus n inputs.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of ok is updated to True if the sum of all coef1 values (c1) is not equal to 0, otherwise it remains False. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
