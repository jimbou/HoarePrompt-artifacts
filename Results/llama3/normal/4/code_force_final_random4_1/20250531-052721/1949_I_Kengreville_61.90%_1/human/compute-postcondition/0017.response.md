Functionality: **This function performs a depth-first search (DFS) on a graph defined by the nodes and their connections based on the given conditions. It takes an integer `i` as input and marks the corresponding node as visited. If the node is not visited, it appends the node to the `nodes` list and recursively calls the DFS function on all unvisited neighboring nodes that satisfy the condition `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2`. The function also updates the `coef0` and `coef1` lists according to the loop body for all neighboring nodes. If the node is already visited, the function does not perform any actions. The final state of the program is that all nodes are marked as visited, and the `nodes` list contains all integers from 0 to n-1. The `coef0` and `coef1` lists are updated accordingly for all nodes.**
