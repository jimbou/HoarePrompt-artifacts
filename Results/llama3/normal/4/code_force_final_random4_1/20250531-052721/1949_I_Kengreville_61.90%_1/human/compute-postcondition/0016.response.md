Postcondition: ***i is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, n is a positive integer, visited is a list of boolean values of length n, nodes is a list of integers, x, y, and r are lists of integers of length n, and coef0 and coef1 are lists of integers of length n. If visited[i] is False, then visited is a list of boolean values of length n where all elements are True, nodes is a list of integers with all integers from 0 to n-1 appended to the end, and coef0 and coef1 are lists of integers of length n where coef0[j] and coef1[j] are set according to the loop body for all j. If visited[i] is True, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
