Output State: **n is greater than 0, i is 0, x is a list of length n where all elements are integers from the input, y is a list of length n where all elements are integers from the input, r is a list of length n where all elements are integers from the input, visited is a list of False values of length n where visited[i] is True, coef0 is a list of length n where coef0[i] is 0, coef1 is a list of length n where coef1[i] is 1, nodes is an empty list, j is undefined, ok is False, c0 is the sum of all coef0 values, c1 is the sum of all coef1 values, and stdin contains a space-separated list of integers minus n inputs.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the loop has iterated over all nodes in the list, updating the values of c0 and c1 by summing up the corresponding coef0 and coef1 values for each node. The loop has finished executing, and the list of nodes is now empty. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
