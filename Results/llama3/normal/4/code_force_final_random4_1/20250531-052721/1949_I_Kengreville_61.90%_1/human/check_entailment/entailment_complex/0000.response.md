Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the problem description by checking if it's possible to change the radii of the disks in such a way that disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent to each other, no two disks overlap in a region of positive area, and the sum of all radii strictly decreases.

The program uses a depth-first search (DFS) to find connected components in the graph defined by the disks and their connections based on the given conditions. It then calculates the sum of radii for each component and checks if it's possible to decrease the sum of radii by changing the radii of the disks in the component.

The program correctly handles the case where a disk is not connected to any other disk, and it correctly handles the case where a disk is connected to multiple other disks.

The program also correctly prints 'YES' if it's possible to change the radii of the disks in the desired manner, and it correctly prints 'NO' otherwise.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
