This function performs a depth-first search (DFS) on a graph defined by the nodes and their connections based on the given conditions. It takes an integer `i` as input and marks the corresponding node as visited. If the node is not visited, it appends the node to the `nodes` list and recursively calls the DFS function on all unvisited neighboring nodes that satisfy the condition `(r[i] + r[j])
