Output State: **n is greater than 2, i is 2, x is a list of length n where all elements are integers from the input, y is a list of length n where all elements are integers from the input, r is a list of length n where all elements are integers from the input, visited[i] is True, coef0[i] is 0, coef1[i] is 1, ok is True if c1 is not equal to 0, otherwise ok is False, c0 is the sum of all coef0 values plus the sum of all coef0[j] values for all j in nodes plus coef0[j], c1 is the sum of all coef1 values plus the sum of all coef1[j] values for all j in nodes plus coef1[j], nodes is a list that must have at least 2 elements, j is the second element in the list nodes, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers minus n inputs.**
