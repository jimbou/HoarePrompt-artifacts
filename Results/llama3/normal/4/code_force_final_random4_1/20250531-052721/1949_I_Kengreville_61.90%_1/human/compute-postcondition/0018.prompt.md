Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is greater than 0, i is 0, x is a list of length n where all elements are integers from the input, y is a list of length n where all elements are integers from the input, r is a list of length n where all elements are integers from the input, visited is a list of False values of length n where visited[i] is True, coef0 is a list of length n where coef0[i] is 0, coef1 is a list of length n where coef1[i] is 1, nodes is a list of nodes, ok is False, and stdin contains a space-separated list of integers minus n inputs.
Code of the loop:
for j in nodes:
    c0 += coef0[j]
    c1 += coef1[j]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is greater than 0, i is 0, x is a list of length n where all elements are integers from the input, y is a list of length n where all elements are integers from the input, r is a list of length n where all elements are integers from the input, visited is a list of False values of length n where visited[i] is True, coef0 is a list of length n where coef0[i] is 0, coef1 is a list of length n where coef1[i] is 1, nodes is a list of nodes that must have at least 1 node, j is the first node in the list, ok is False, c0 is the sum of coef0[j] and its previous value, c1 is the sum of coef1[j] and its previous value, and stdin contains a space-separated list of integers minus n inputs.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is greater than 0, i is 0, x is a list of length n where all elements are integers from the input, y is a list of length n where all elements are integers from the input, r is a list of length n where all elements are integers from the input, visited is a list of False values of length n where visited[i] is True, coef0 is a list of length n where coef0[i] is 0, coef1 is a list of length n where coef1[i] is 1, nodes is a list of nodes that must have at least 2 nodes, j is the second node in the list, ok is False, c0 is the sum of coef0[j] and its previous value, c1 is the sum of coef1[j] and its previous value, and stdin contains a space-separated list of integers minus n inputs.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is greater than 0, i is 0, x is a list of length n where all elements are integers from the input, y is a list of length n where all elements are integers from the input, r is a list of length n where all elements are integers from the input, visited is a list of False values of length n where visited[i] is True, coef0 is a list of length n where coef0[i] is 0, coef1 is a list of length n where coef1[i] is 1, nodes is a list of nodes that must have at least 3 nodes, j is the third node in the list, ok is False, c0 is the sum of coef0[j] and its previous value, c1 is the sum of coef1[j] and its previous value, and stdin contains a space-separated list of integers minus n inputs.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
