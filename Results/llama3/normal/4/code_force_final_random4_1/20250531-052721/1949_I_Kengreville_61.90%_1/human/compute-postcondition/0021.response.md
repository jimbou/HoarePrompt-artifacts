The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **n is greater than 1, i is 1, x is a list of length n where all elements are integers from the input, y is a list of length n where all elements are integers from the input, r is a list of length n where all elements are integers from the input. If visited[i] is False, then visited[i] is set to True, coef0[i] is set to 0, coef1[i] is set to 1, ok is set to True if c1 is not equal to 0, otherwise ok is set to False, c0 is the sum of all coef0 values, c1 is the sum of all coef1 values, and stdin contains a space-separated list of integers minus n inputs. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
