The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and not_mid, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `not_mid`. If not_mid is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, we know that not_mid is right - left + 1 - (right - left + 1) // 2. Since right - left + 1 is at least 2, not_mid is at least 1. So for the loop to be executed  not_mid is at least 1 and i is 0.
State: **left and right are non-negative integers such that left < right and right - left + 1 is at least 2, arr is a list of integers of length at least right + 1 where arr[left + mid - i - 1] is small_element + i for all i in range(mid), cliquess is a list of integers of length at least right + 1 where cliquess[left + i] is clique for all i in range(mid), clique is a non-negative integer, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is (right - left + 1) // 2, not_mid is at least 1, i is 0**
