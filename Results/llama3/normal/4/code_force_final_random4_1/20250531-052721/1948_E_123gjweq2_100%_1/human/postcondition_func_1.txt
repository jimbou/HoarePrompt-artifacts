This function populates a portion of two lists, `arr` and `cliquess`, with values based on the input parameters `left`, `right`, and `clique`. It assigns values from `left + 1` to `right + 1` to the elements in `arr` from index `left` to `right`, and assigns the value of `clique` to the corresponding elements in `cliquess`. The function effectively creates a sequence of values in `arr` and a sequence of identical values in `cliquess`, both spanning from `left` to `right`.
