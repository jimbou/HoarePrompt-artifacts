Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of partitioning a graph into the minimum possible number of cliques. The program takes two integers, n and k, as input and assigns distinct integers to each vertex in the graph. It then creates a graph where an edge is added between two vertices if the sum of the absolute differences of their indices and assigned integers is less than or equal to k.

The program uses two functions: func_1 and make_array. The func_1 function calculates the number of cliques required to partition the graph and initializes two arrays, arr and cliquess, to store the assigned integers and clique numbers for each vertex, respectively. It then calls the make_array function to assign integers to the vertices and create the cliques.

The make_array function takes three parameters: left, right, and clique. It calculates the small and big elements for the current clique and assigns integers to the vertices in the clique. The integers are assigned in a way that the sum of the absolute differences of the indices and assigned integers is less than or equal to k.

The program then prints the assigned integers, the number of cliques, and the clique numbers for each vertex.

Based on the provided problem description and the given program, the program appears to be correct. It correctly assigns integers to the vertices, creates the cliques, and prints the required output.

Correctness: **True**
