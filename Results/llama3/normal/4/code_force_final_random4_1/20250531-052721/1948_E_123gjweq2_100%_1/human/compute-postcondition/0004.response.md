Output State: **left and right are non-negative integers such that left < right and right - left + 1 is at least 2, arr is a list of integers of length at least right + 1 where arr[left + mid - i - 1] is small_element + i, arr[left + mid - 1] is small_element + 1, cliquess is a list of integers of length at least right + 1 where cliquess[left + i] is clique, cliquess[left + 1] is clique, clique is a non-negative integer, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is at least 2, not_mid is right - left + 1 - (right - left + 1) // 2, i is 1**

The code modifies the values of `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` and `cliquess[left + i]`. The first line assigns the value of `small_element + i` to `arr[left + mid - i - 1]`, and since `i` is 1, `arr[left + mid - 1]` becomes `small_element + 1`. The second line assigns the value of `clique` to `cliquess[left + i]`, and since `i` is 1, `cliquess[left + 1]` becomes `clique`. All other variables remain unchanged.
