Functionality: **The function takes in a list of integers `arr`, a list of integers `cliquess`, and three integers `left`, `right`, and `clique` as input. It modifies the list `arr` by assigning values to a subset of its elements, specifically those at indices `left` to `right`, in a specific pattern. The pattern consists of two parts: the first part assigns values from `left + 1` to `left + mid` (where `mid` is half of the length of the subset), and the second part assigns values from `right` to `left + mid` in reverse order. The function also assigns the value of `clique` to the corresponding elements in the list `cliquess`. The function does not return any value.**
