Output State: **left and right are non-negative integers such that left < right and right - left + 1 is at least 2, arr is a list of integers of length at least right + 1 where arr[left + mid - i - 1] is small_element + i for all i in range(mid) and arr[left + mid + i] is big_element - i for i in range(not_mid + 1), cliquess is a list of integers of length at least right + 1 where cliquess[left + i] is clique for all i in range(mid) and cliquess[left + mid + i] is clique for i in range(not_mid + 1), clique is a non-negative integer, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is (right - left + 1) // 2, not_mid is at least 2, i is 2, arr[left + mid + i] is big_element - i, cliquess[left + mid + i] is clique.**

The code modifies the values of `arr[left + mid + i]` and `cliquess[left + mid + i]`. The first line assigns the value of `big_element - i` to `arr[left + mid + i]`, and the second line assigns the value of `clique` to `cliquess[left + mid + i]`. The values of `left`, `right`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, `not_mid`, and `i` remain unchanged. The lists `arr` and `cliquess` are modified at the specified indices, but their lengths and other elements remain the same.
