Output State: **left and right are non-negative integers such that left < right and right - left + 1 is at least 2, arr is a list of integers of length at least right + 1 where arr[left + mid - i - 1] is small_element + i for all i in range(mid), cliquess is a list of integers of length at least right + 1 where cliquess[left + i] is clique for all i in range(mid), clique is a non-negative integer, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is (right - left + 1) // 2, not_mid is right - left + 1 - (right - left + 1) // 2, i is mid - 1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: The loop has iterated mid times, where mid is the integer division of right - left + 1 by 2. The array arr has been modified such that the elements at indices left + mid - i - 1 are set to small_element + i for all i in range(mid). The list cliquess has also been modified such that the elements at indices left + i are set to clique for all i in range(mid). The values of clique, small_element, big_element, mid, and not_mid remain unchanged. The loop variable i has reached its final value of mid - 1.
