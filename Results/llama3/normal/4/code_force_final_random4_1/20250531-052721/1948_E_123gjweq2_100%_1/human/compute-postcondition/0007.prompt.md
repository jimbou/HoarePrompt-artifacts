Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: left and right are non-negative integers such that left < right, arr is a list of integers of length at least right + 1, cliquess is a list of integers of length at least right + 1, clique is a non-negative integer, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is (right - left + 1) // 2, not_mid is right - left + 1 - (right - left + 1) // 2
Code of the loop:
for i in range(mid):
    arr[left + mid - i - 1] = small_element + i
    cliquess[left + i] = clique


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: left and right are non-negative integers such that left < right and right - left + 1 is at least 2, arr is a list of integers of length at least right + 1 where arr[left + mid - i - 1] is small_element + i, cliquess is a list of integers of length at least right + 1 where cliquess[left + i] is clique, clique is a non-negative integer, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is at least 1, not_mid is right - left + 1 - (right - left + 1) // 2, i is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: left and right are non-negative integers such that left < right and right - left + 1 is at least 2, arr is a list of integers of length at least right + 1 where arr[left + mid - i - 1] is small_element + i, arr[left + mid - 1] is small_element + 1, cliquess is a list of integers of length at least right + 1 where cliquess[left + i] is clique, cliquess[left + 1] is clique, clique is a non-negative integer, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is at least 2, not_mid is right - left + 1 - (right - left + 1) // 2, i is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: left and right are non-negative integers such that left < right and right - left + 1 is at least 2, arr is a list of integers of length at least right + 1 where arr[left + mid - i - 1] is small_element + i, arr[left + mid - 1] is small_element + 1, cliquess is a list of integers of length at least right + 1 where cliquess[left + i] is clique, cliquess[left + 1] is clique, clique is a non-negative integer, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is at least 2, not_mid is right - left + 1 - (right - left + 1) // 2, i is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
