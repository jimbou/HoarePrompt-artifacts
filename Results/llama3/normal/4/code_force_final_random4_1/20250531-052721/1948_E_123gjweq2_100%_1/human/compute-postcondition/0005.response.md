To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for i in range(mid):`, so we can only adjust the state of `i` and `mid`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `mid`. If `i` is less than `mid`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `mid` is at least 2.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `mid` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

State: **left and right are non-negative integers such that left < right and right - left + 1 is at least 2, arr is a list of integers of length at least right + 1 where arr[left + mid - i - 1] is small_element + i, arr[left + mid - 1] is small_element + 1, cliquess is a list of integers of length at least right + 1 where cliquess[left + i] is clique, cliquess[left + 1] is clique, clique is a non-negative integer, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is at least 2, not_mid is right - left + 1 - (right - left + 1) // 2, i is 2**
