Functionality: This function takes two positive integers, n and k, as input, where 2 <= n <= 40 and 1 <= k <= 2n. It calculates the ceiling of n/k and assigns it to the variable 'cliques'. It then initializes two lists, 'arr' and 'cliquess', of length n with all elements set to 0. The function then iterates over the range of 'cliques' and sets the values of 'arr' and 'cliquess' in a specific pattern. Finally, it prints the values of 'arr', 'cliques', and 'cliquess'. The function does not return any value.
