Output State: **left and right are non-negative integers such that left < right, arr is a list of integers of length at least right + 1, cliquess is a list of integers of length at least right + 1, clique is a non-negative integer, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is (right - left + 1) // 2, not_mid is right - left + 1 - (right - left + 1) // 2**

The code executes four lines, each assigning a value to a new variable. The first line assigns the value of `left + 1` to `small_element`. The second line assigns the value of `right + 1` to `big_element`. The third line calculates the value of `mid` as `(big_element - small_element + 1) // 2`, which simplifies to `(right - left + 1) // 2`. The fourth line calculates the value of `not_mid` as `right - left + 1 - mid`, which simplifies to `right - left + 1 - (right - left + 1) // 2`. The values of `left`, `right`, `arr`, `cliquess`, and `clique` remain unchanged.
