The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and mid, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `mid`. If `i` is less than `mid`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `mid` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `mid` must be greater than 1.
State: **left and right are non-negative integers such that left < right and right - left + 1 is at least 2, arr is a list of integers of length at least right + 1 where arr[left + mid - i - 1] is small_element + i, cliquess is a list of integers of length at least right + 1 where cliquess[left + i] is clique, clique is a non-negative integer, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is at least 2, not_mid is right - left + 1 - (right - left + 1) // 2, i is 1**
