Output State: **left and right are non-negative integers such that left < right and right - left + 1 is at least 2, arr is a list of integers of length at least right + 1 where arr[left + mid - i - 1] is small_element + i for all i in range(mid) and arr[left + mid + i] is big_element - i for i in range(not_mid), cliquess is a list of integers of length at least right + 1 where cliquess[left + i] is clique for all i in range(mid) and cliquess[left + mid + i] is clique for i in range(not_mid), clique is a non-negative integer, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is (right - left + 1) // 2, not_mid is right - left + 1 - (right - left + 1) // 2, i is not_mid - 1.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, with the only difference being that the loop has executed all the iterations. The values of the variables in the loop head and body have been updated accordingly. The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body remains unchanged.
