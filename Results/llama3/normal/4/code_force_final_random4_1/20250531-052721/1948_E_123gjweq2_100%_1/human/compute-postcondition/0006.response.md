Output State: **left and right are non-negative integers such that left < right and right - left + 1 is at least 2, arr is a list of integers of length at least right + 1 where arr[left + mid - i - 1] is small_element + i, arr[left + mid - 1] is small_element + 1, cliquess is a list of integers of length at least right + 1 where cliquess[left + i] is clique, cliquess[left + 1] is clique, clique is a non-negative integer, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is at least 2, not_mid is right - left + 1 - (right - left + 1) // 2, i is 2.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the value of `small_element + i` to `arr[left + mid - i - 1]`. Since `small_element` is `left + 1` and `i` is 2, `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` becomes `left + 1 + 2`, which is `left + 3`. The second line assigns the value of `clique` to `cliquess[left + i]`. Since `i` is 2, `cliquess[left + 2]` becomes `clique`.

The final state includes all the information from the precondition that remains valid after the code execution. The values of `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` and `cliquess[left + i]` are updated according to the code. The other variables, such as `left`, `right`, `mid`, `not_mid`, `small_element`, `big_element`, and `clique`, retain their original values.
