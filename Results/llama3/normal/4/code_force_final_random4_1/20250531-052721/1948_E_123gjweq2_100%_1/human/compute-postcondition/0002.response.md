Output State: **left and right are non-negative integers such that left < right and right - left + 1 is at least 2, arr is a list of integers of length at least right + 1 where arr[left + mid - i - 1] is small_element + i, cliquess is a list of integers of length at least right + 1 where cliquess[left + i] is clique, clique is a non-negative integer, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is at least 1, not_mid is right - left + 1 - (right - left + 1) // 2, i is 0**
