To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `mid`. The loop will execute if `mid` is at least 1. Since `mid` is calculated as `(right - left + 1) // 2`, we need to ensure that `right - left + 1` is at least 2.

State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` < `right` and `right - left + 1` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers of length at least `right + 1`, `cliquess` is a list of integers of length at least `right + 1`, `clique` is a non-negative integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is at least 1, `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - (right - left + 1) // 2`, `i` is 0**
