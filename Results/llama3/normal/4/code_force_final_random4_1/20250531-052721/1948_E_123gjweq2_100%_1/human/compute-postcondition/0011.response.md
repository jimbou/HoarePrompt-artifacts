Output State: **left and right are non-negative integers such that left < right and right - left + 1 is at least 2, arr is a list of integers of length at least right + 1 where arr[left + mid - i - 1] is small_element + i for all i in range(mid) and arr[left + mid + i] is big_element - i for i in range(not_mid + 1), cliquess is a list of integers of length at least right + 1 where cliquess[left + i] is clique for all i in range(mid) and cliquess[left + mid + i] is clique for i in range(not_mid + 1), clique is a non-negative integer, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is (right - left + 1) // 2, not_mid is at least 1, i is 1**

The code modifies the values of `arr` and `cliquess` at index `left + mid + i`. The value of `arr` at this index is updated to `big_element - i`, and the value of `cliquess` at this index is updated to `clique`. Since `i` is 1, the value of `arr` at index `left + mid + 1` becomes `big_element - 1`, and the value of `cliquess` at index `left + mid + 1` becomes `clique`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
