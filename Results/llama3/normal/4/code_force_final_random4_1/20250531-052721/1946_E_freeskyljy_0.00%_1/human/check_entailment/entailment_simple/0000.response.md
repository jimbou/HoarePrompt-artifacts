Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the number of different permutations that could have been guessed based on the given prefix maximums and suffix maximums. The program first checks for some edge cases where the number of permutations is 0, and then calculates the number of permutations using the formula for combinations and the product of integers.

Correctness: **True**
