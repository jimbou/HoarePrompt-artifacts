Output State: **N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer between 1 and N, M2 is an integer between 1 and N, L is a list of M1 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, R is a list of M2 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, nums_left is an integer equal to N - R[0] - 1, stdin contains several test cases minus one. If M1 is larger than 1, ans is an integer equal to the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken L[-1] - 1 at a time multiplied by the product of all integers from L[-1] - 1 down to 1 modulo MOD, cur is an integer equal to 0, i is an integer equal to 1. Otherwise, ans is an integer equal to the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken L[-1] - 1 at a time.**

In natural language, the output state is: N, M1, M2, L, and R remain unchanged. The variable nums_left is updated to be equal to N - R[0] - 1. The values of ans, cur, and i are not affected by the code. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by one.
