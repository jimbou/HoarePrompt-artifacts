The only variable in the loop head is variable i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i.  If i is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is equal to L[-1] - 3, So for the loop to be executed one more time L[-1] must be greater than 4.
State: **N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer between 2 and N, M2 is an integer between 1 and N, L is a list of M1 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, with at least one element greater than 4, R is a list of M2 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, stdin contains several test cases minus one, ans is an integer equal to the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken L[-1] - 1 at a time, cur is an integer equal to M1 - 3 if i is equal to L[cur], otherwise cur is an integer equal to M1 - 2, nums_left is an integer equal to L[-1] - 4, i is an integer equal to L[-1] - 3, and if i is equal to L[cur], then the current value of i is equal to the current value of L[cur + 1], otherwise ans is an integer equal to the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken L[-1] - 1 at a time multiplied by L[-1] - 4 modulo MOD.**
