Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `M1` is an integer between 2 and `N`, `M2` is an integer between 1 and `N`, `L` is a list of `M1` integers between 1 and `N` in ascending order, with at least one element greater than 2, `R` is a list of `M2` integers between 1 and `N` in ascending order, stdin contains several test cases minus one, `ans` is an integer equal to the number of combinations of `N - 1` items taken `L[-1] - 1` at a time multiplied by `L[-1] - 2` modulo `MOD`, `cur` is an integer equal to `M1 - 2`, `nums_left` is an integer equal to `L[-1] - 2`, `i` is an integer equal to `L[-1] - 1`, and `i` is not equal to `L[cur]`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by multiplying it with `nums_left` (which is `L[-1] - 2`) and taking the result modulo `MOD`. The other variables remain unchanged.
