Output State: **N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer between 1 and N, M2 is an integer between 1 and N, L is a list of M1 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, R is a list of M2 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, stdin contains several test cases minus one, ans is an integer equal to the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken L[-1] - 1 at a time, cur is an integer equal to M1 - 2.**

The code calculates the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken L[-1] - 1 at a time and assigns it to the variable ans. It also calculates M1 - 2 and assigns it to the variable cur. The values of N, M1, M2, L, R, and stdin remain unchanged.
