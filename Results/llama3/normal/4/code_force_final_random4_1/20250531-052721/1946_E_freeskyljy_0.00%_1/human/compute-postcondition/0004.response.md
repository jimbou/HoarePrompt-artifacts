Postcondition: **N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer between 1 and N, M2 is an integer between 1 and N, L is a list of M1 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, R is a list of M2 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, stdin contains several test cases minus one. The last element of L is equal to the first element of R. The current value of the first element of L is not 1 or the current value of the first element of R is not N.**
