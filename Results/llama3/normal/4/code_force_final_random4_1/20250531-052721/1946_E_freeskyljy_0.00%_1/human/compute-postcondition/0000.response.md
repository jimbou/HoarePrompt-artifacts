Output State: **N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer between 1 and N, M2 is an integer between 1 and N, L is a list of M1 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, R is a list of M2 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, stdin contains several test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the values of N, M1, and M2 are assigned from the first line of the input, which contains three integers. The list L is assigned the M1 integers from the second line of the input, and the list R is assigned the M2 integers from the third line of the input. Since the input is read line by line, after executing this code block, stdin will contain several test cases minus one.
