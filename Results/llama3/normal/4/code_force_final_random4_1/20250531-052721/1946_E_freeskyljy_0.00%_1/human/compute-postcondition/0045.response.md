Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and `N` is greater than `R[cur]` + 1, `M1` is an integer between 1 and `N`, `M2` is an integer between 1 and `N` and is greater than 1, `L` is a list of `M1` integers between 1 and `N` in ascending order, `R` is a list of `M2` integers between 1 and `N` in ascending order, `nums_left` is an integer equal to `N` - `R[0]` - 2, `i` is equal to `R[cur]` + 1, `ans` is an integer equal to the number of combinations of `N` - 1 items taken `L[-1]` - 1 at a time multiplied by the product of all integers from `L[-1]` - 1 down to 1 modulo `MOD` if `M1` is larger than 1, otherwise `ans` is an integer equal to the number of combinations of `N` - 1 items taken `L[-1]` - 1 at a time, then multiplied by `N` - `R[0]` - 2 modulo `MOD` if `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`, otherwise `cur` is 2 and `i` is `R[0]` + 1, and the current value of `ans` is equal to `ans` * `nums_left` % `MOD`, and stdin contains several test cases minus one.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `ans` has been updated to be the result of multiplying the previous value of `ans` by `nums_left` and taking the result modulo `MOD`. All other variables remain unchanged.
