Output State: **N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and N is greater than R[0] + 1, M1 is an integer between 1 and N, M2 is an integer between 1 and N and is greater than 1, L is a list of M1 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, R is a list of M2 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, nums_left is an integer equal to N - R[0] - 1, stdin contains several test cases minus one, ans is an integer equal to the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken L[-1] - 1 at a time multiplied by the product of all integers from L[-1] - 1 down to 1 modulo MOD if M1 is larger than 1, otherwise ans is an integer equal to the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken L[-1] - 1 at a time, cur is 2, i is R[0] + 1, and the current value of i is equal to R[cur].**

The value of `cur` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 2. The value of `i` is still equal to `R[0] + 1`, but now it is also equal to `R[cur]` because `cur` is 2. The values of the other variables are not affected.
