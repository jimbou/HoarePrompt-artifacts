Output State: **N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and N is greater than R[0] + 1, M1 is an integer between 1 and N, M2 is an integer between 1 and N and is greater than 1, L is a list of M1 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, R is a list of M2 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, nums_left is an integer equal to N - R[0] - 2, i is equal to R[cur] + 1, ans is an integer equal to the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken L[-1] - 1 at a time multiplied by the product of all integers from L[-1] - 1 down to 1 modulo MOD if M1 is larger than 1, otherwise ans is an integer equal to the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken L[-1] - 1 at a time, then multiplied by N - R[0] - 2 modulo MOD if i is not equal to R[cur], otherwise cur is 2 and i is R[0] + 1, and the current value of i is equal to R[cur] + 1, stdin contains several test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of `nums_left` has been decremented by 1, and the value of `i` has been incremented by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is still dependent on the values of `M1`, `L[-1]`, and `R[0]`, but its calculation is now based on the updated values of `nums_left` and `i`.
