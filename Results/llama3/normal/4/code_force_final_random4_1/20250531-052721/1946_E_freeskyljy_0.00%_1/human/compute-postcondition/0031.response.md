Output State: **N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer between 2 and N, M2 is an integer between 1 and N, L is a list of M1 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, R is a list of M2 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, stdin contains several test cases minus one, ans is an integer equal to the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken L[-1] - 1 at a time multiplied by the product of all integers from L[-1] - 1 down to 1 modulo MOD, cur is an integer equal to 0, nums_left is an integer equal to 0, i is an integer equal to 1.**

This output state represents the final state of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations. The loop has iterated until `i` has reached 1, at which point it exits. The value of `ans` has been updated to be the number of combinations of `N - 1` items taken `L[-1] - 1` at a time, multiplied by the product of all integers from `L[-1] - 1` down to 1 modulo `MOD`. The values of `cur`, `nums_left`, and `i` have been updated accordingly. The state of the other variables in the precondition remains unchanged.
