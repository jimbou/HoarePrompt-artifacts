Functionality: **This function calculates the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken L[-1] - 1 at a time, and then multiplies it by the product of all integers from L[-1] - 1 down to 1 modulo MOD if M1 is larger than 1, otherwise it multiplies it by the product of all integers from N - R[0] down to 1 modulo MOD. However, if certain conditions are not met, the function returns 0. Specifically, it returns 0 if the last element of L is not equal to the first element of R, if the first element of L is not 1 or the first element of R is not N, or if M1 and M2 are both greater than 1 and the second last element of L is equal to the second element of R.**
