Output State: **The program returns the value of 'ans', which is an integer equal to the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken L[-1] - 1 at a time multiplied by the product of all integers from L[-1] - 1 down to 1 modulo MOD if M1 is larger than 1, otherwise it is equal to the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken L[-1] - 1 at a time, then multiplied by the product of all integers from N - R[0] down to 1 modulo MOD.**
