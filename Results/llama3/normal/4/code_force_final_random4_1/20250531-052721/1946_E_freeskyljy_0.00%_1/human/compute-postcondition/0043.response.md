The variable in the loop head is variable i and N, so we can only adjust those two. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables i and N. If i is less than N, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is equal to R[cur] + 1, N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and N is greater than R[0] + 1. N being greater than R[0] + 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to N is greater than R[cur] + 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and N is greater than R[cur] + 1, M1 is an integer between 1 and N, M2 is an integer between 1 and N and is greater than 1, L is a list of M1 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, R is a list of M2 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, nums_left is an integer equal to N - R[0] - 2, i is equal to R[cur] + 1, ans is an integer equal to the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken L[-1] - 1 at a time multiplied by the product of all integers from L[-1] - 1 down to 1 modulo MOD if M1 is larger than 1, otherwise ans is an integer equal to the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken L[-1] - 1 at a time, then multiplied by N - R[0] - 2 modulo MOD if i is not equal to R[cur], otherwise cur is 2 and i is R[0] + 1, and the current value of i is equal to R[cur] + 1, stdin contains several test cases minus one.**
