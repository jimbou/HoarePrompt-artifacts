Output State: **N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer between 1 and N, M2 is an integer between 1 and N and is greater than 1, L is a list of M1 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, R is a list of M2 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, nums_left is an integer equal to N - R[0] - 1, stdin contains several test cases minus one, ans is an integer equal to the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken L[-1] - 1 at a time multiplied by the product of all integers from L[-1] - 1 down to 1 modulo MOD if M1 is larger than 1, otherwise ans is an integer equal to the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken L[-1] - 1 at a time, cur is 1, i is R[0] + 1.**

The code modifies the values of `cur` and `i`. The first line assigns 1 to `cur`, and the second line assigns `R[0] + 1` to `i`. The values of `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, `R`, `nums_left`, `ans`, and the contents of `stdin` remain unchanged.
