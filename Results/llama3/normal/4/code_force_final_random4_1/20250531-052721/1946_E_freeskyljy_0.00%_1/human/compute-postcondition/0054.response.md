Postcondition: ***N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer between 1 and N, M2 is an integer between 1 and N, L is a list of M1 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, R is a list of M2 integers between 1 and N in ascending order. If M2 is larger than 1, then nums_left is equal to 0, i is equal to N, ans is an integer equal to the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken L[-1] - 1 at a time multiplied by the product of all integers from L[-1] - 1 down to 1 modulo MOD if M1 is larger than 1, otherwise ans is an integer equal to the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken L[-1] - 1 at a time, then multiplied by the product of all integers from N - R[0] down to 1 modulo MOD, cur is equal to M2, and stdin contains several test cases minus one. Otherwise, the values of nums_left, i, ans, and cur remain unchanged.***
