Postcondition: **N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer between 1 and N, M2 is an integer between 1 and N, L is a list of M1 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, R is a list of M2 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, stdin contains several test cases minus one. The first element of L is 1, the first element of R is N and the last element of L is equal to the first element of R. The current value of M1 is greater than 1, the current value of M2 is greater than 1, and the second last element of L is equal to the second element of R.**
