Output State: **N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer between 2 and N, M2 is an integer between 1 and N, L is a list of M1 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, with at least one element greater than 2, R is a list of M2 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, stdin contains several test cases minus one, ans is an integer equal to the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken L[-1] - 1 at a time, cur is an integer equal to M1 - 3, nums_left is an integer equal to L[-1] - 2, i is an integer equal to L[-1] - 1, and the current value of i is equal to the current value of L[cur + 1].**

In this output state, the value of `cur` has been decremented by 1, changing from `M1 - 2` to `M1 - 3`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `i` and `L[cur]` is now between `i` and `L[cur + 1]`, since `cur` has been decremented.
