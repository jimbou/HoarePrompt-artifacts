Output State: **N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer between 2 and N, M2 is an integer between 1 and N, L is a list of M1 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, R is a list of M2 integers between 1 and N in ascending order, stdin contains several test cases minus one, ans is an integer equal to the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken L[-1] - 1 at a time, cur is an integer equal to M1 - 2, nums_left is an integer equal to L[-1] - 2, i is an integer equal to L[-1] - 1.**

The code executes two lines. The first line assigns the value of `L[-1] - 2` to `nums_left`. Since `L[-1]` is an integer between 1 and N, `nums_left` becomes an integer equal to `L[-1] - 2`. The second line assigns the value of `L[-1] - 1` to `i`. Since `L[-1]` is an integer between 1 and N, `i` becomes an integer equal to `L[-1] - 1`. No other variables are affected.
