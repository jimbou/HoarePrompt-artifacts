Output State: **l is equal to r + 1, and the values of n, k, edges, g, and c remain unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `l` is equal to `r + 1`, and the values of `n`, `k`, `edges`, `g`, and `c` remain unchanged. This means that the loop has terminated, and the values of the variables that were not affected by the loop head and body have remained the same.
