Output State: **x is 1, p is 1, stack is [(1, 1)], visited is {1}, d is {(1): 1}, r is 0, A is a positive integer, g is a dictionary representing a tree with n vertices, k is a non-negative integer less than n, n is an integer.**

The code adds the current value of `x` to the `visited` set and updates the value of `d[x]` to 1. Since `x` is 1, `visited` becomes {1} and `d` becomes {(1): 1}. No other variables are affected.
