#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer such that k < n, and edges is a list of pairs of integers (a, b) where 1 <= a, b <= n, representing the edges of a tree with n vertices.
    g = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for (a, b) in edges:
        g[a].append(b)
        
        g[b].append(a)
        
    #State: n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer such that k < n, edges is an empty list, and g is a list of n+1 lists where each list contains all the vertices that are directly connected to the vertex represented by the index of the list.
    c = 0
    l = 1
    r = n // k
    while l <= r:
        mid = l + (r - l) // 2
        
        if check(mid):
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid - 1
        
    #State: l is equal to r + 1, and the values of n, k, edges, g, and c remain unchanged.
    print(r)
    #This is printed: r (where r is one less than l)

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes as input a positive integer n, a non-negative integer k such that k < n, and a list of pairs of integers representing the edges of a tree with n vertices. It constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree and then performs a binary search to find a value. The function prints the result of the binary search, which is one less than the value found. The input variables remain unchanged throughout the function's execution. The function's purpose is to find and print a specific value related to the input tree, without modifying the input variables.
