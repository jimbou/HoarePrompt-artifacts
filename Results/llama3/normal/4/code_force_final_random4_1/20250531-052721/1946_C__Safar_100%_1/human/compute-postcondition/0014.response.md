Postcondition: ***`x` is 1, `p` is 1, `A` is a positive integer, `g` is a dictionary representing a tree with n vertices where `g[1]` has at least two nodes, `k` is a non-negative integer less than n, `n` is an integer, `r` is 0, `d` is {(1): 1}, `visited` is {1}. If `node` is not equal to `p`, then `stack` is [(1, 1), (node, 1), (node, 1)]. Otherwise, `stack` is [(1, 1), (node, 1)].***
