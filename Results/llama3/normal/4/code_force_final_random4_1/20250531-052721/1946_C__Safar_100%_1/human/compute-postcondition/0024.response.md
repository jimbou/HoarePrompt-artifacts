Postcondition: ***`x` is 1, `p` is 1, stack is [(1, 1)], visited is a set containing `x`, A is a positive integer, g is a dictionary representing a tree with n vertices, k is a non-negative integer less than n, n is an integer. If the current value of `d[x]` is greater than or equal to A, then r is 1. Otherwise, the value of `d[x]` is incremented by 1 and r remains 0.***
