Output State: **`x` is 1, `p` is 1, `A` is a positive integer, `g` is a dictionary representing a tree with n vertices where `g[1]` has at least two nodes, `k` is a non-negative integer less than n, `n` is an integer, `r` is 0, `d` is {(1): 1}, `visited` is {1}, `stack` is [(1, 1), (node, 1), (node, 1)] if `node` is not equal to `p`, otherwise `stack` is [(1, 1), (node, 1)].**

In this output state, the value of `stack` has been updated by appending the tuple `(node, x)` to it. If `node` is not equal to `p`, then `stack` now contains three tuples: `(1, 1)`, `(node, 1)`, and `(node, 1)`. Otherwise, `stack` contains two tuples: `(1, 1)` and `(node, 1)`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
