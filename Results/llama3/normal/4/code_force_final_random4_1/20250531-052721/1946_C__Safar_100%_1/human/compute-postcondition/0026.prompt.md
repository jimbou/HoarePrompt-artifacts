Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer such that k < n, edges is an empty list, g is a list of n+1 lists where each list contains all the vertices that are directly connected to the vertex represented by the index of the list, c is 0, l is 1, and r is the integer division of n by k.
Code of the loop:
while l <= r:
    mid = l + (r - l) // 2
    if check(mid):
        l = mid + 1
    else:
        r = mid - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k < n`, `edges` is an empty list, `g` is a list of `n+1` lists where each list contains all the vertices that are directly connected to the vertex represented by the index of the list, `c` is 0. If `check(mid)` returns True, then `l` is the integer division of `r-1` by 2 plus 2, `r` is the integer division of `n` by `k`, and `mid` is the integer division of `r-1` by 2 plus 1. If `check(mid)` returns False, then `l` is 1, `r` is the integer division of `mid-1` by 2, and `mid` is the integer division of `n` by `k` divided by 2 plus 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k < n`, `edges` is an empty list, `g` is a list of `n+1` lists where each list contains all the vertices that are directly connected to the vertex represented by the index of the list, `c` is 0, and `r` must be greater than or equal to `l`. If `check(mid)` is true, then `l` is `mid + 1` and `r` is the integer division of `n` by `k` or the integer division of `mid-1` by 2. Otherwise, `r` is `mid - 1` and `l` is the integer division of `r-1` by 2 plus 2 or 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k < n`, `edges` is an empty list, `g` is a list of `n+1` lists where each list contains all the vertices that are directly connected to the vertex represented by the index of the list, `c` is 0, `r-1` is greater than or equal to 2 times `l` minus 2, `r` is greater than or equal to `l`. If `check(mid)` is true, then `l` is equal to `mid + 1` which is equal to `l + (r - l) // 2 + 1`. Otherwise, `r` is equal to `mid - 1`


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
