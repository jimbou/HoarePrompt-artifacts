The code prints the value of `r`.
Since `l` is equal to `r + 1`, we can deduce that `r` is one less than `l`.
However, the exact values of `l` and `r` are not provided, so we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `r`.
Based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the value of `r`, which is one less than `l`.
Output: **r (where r is one less than l)**
