Output State: **`x` is 1, `p` is 1, `stack` is [(1, 1), (node, 1)], `visited` is {1}, `d` is {(1): 1}, `r` is 0, `A` is a positive integer, `g` is a dictionary representing a tree with n vertices where `g[1]` has at least one node, `k` is a non-negative integer less than n, `n` is an integer, and the current value of `node` is not equal to `p`.**

In this output state, the value of `stack` has been updated by appending the tuple `(node, x)` to it. The value of `x` is still 1, and the value of `node` is still not equal to `p`. The other variables remain unchanged.
