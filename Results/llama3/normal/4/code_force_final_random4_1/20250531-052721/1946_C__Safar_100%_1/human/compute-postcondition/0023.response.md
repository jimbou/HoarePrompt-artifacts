The value of `d[p]` is increased by the value of `d[x]`. The value of `d[x]` is 1, so the value of `d[p]` is increased by 1. The value of `d[p]` was 1, so the new value of `d[p]` is 2. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`x` is 1, `p` is 1, stack is [(1, 1)], visited is a set containing `x`, d is {(1): 2}, r is 0, A is a positive integer, g is a dictionary representing a tree with n vertices, k is a non-negative integer less than n, n is an integer. The value of `d[x]` is less than A.**
