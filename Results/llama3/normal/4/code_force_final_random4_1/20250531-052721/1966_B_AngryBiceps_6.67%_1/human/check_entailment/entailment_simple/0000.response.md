Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by checking if the first row, last row, first column, and last column of the grid are all the same color. If they are, then it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color by performing operations. Otherwise, it is not possible.

However, the program has a flaw in its logic. It only checks if the first row and last row are the same color, and if the first column and last column are the same color. It does not check if the entire grid is the same color.

For example, consider a grid where the first row and last row are all 'W', but the middle rows are all 'B'. In this case, the program would print 'YES', but it is not possible to make all squares in the grid the same color.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
