The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is `n-1`, which means `n` must be at least 1 for `i` to be 0 at the start of the loop. So, `n` must be greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.

State: **`n` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is an empty string, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains one less input, `_` is 1**
