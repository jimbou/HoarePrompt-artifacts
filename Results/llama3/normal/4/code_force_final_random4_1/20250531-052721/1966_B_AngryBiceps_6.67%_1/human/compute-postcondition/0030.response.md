Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, m is an integer, a is a list containing n strings, first_row is a string containing n characters, last_row is a string containing n characters, i is n-1, stdin is empty**

In natural language, this output state means that the loop has executed n times, where n is the initial value of the variable n. After the loop finishes, the list a contains n strings, each of which was input during one iteration of the loop. The strings first_row and last_row contain the first and last characters, respectively, of each string in the list a. The variable i has been incremented n times and now has the value n-1. The standard input (stdin) is empty, indicating that all input has been consumed by the loop.
