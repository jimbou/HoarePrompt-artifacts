According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list containing two strings, `first_row` is a string consisting of the first character of the first input string and the first character of the second input string, `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of the first input string and the last character of the second input string, `i` is 2, `stdin` contains no input, `_` is 1**
