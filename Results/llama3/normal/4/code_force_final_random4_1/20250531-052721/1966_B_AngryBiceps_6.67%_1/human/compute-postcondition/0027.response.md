Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, m is an integer, a is a list containing two strings, first_row is a string containing two characters, last_row is a string containing two characters, i is 1, stdin is empty**

The code snippet modifies the state of the variables as follows:

* The first line appends a new string input from stdin to the list `a`, making it contain two strings.
* The second line appends the first character of the last string in `a` to `first_row`, making it a string containing two characters.
* The third line appends the last character of the last string in `a` to `last_row`, making it a string containing two characters.

The values of `n`, `m`, and `i` remain unchanged. Stdin is now empty since one input has been consumed.
