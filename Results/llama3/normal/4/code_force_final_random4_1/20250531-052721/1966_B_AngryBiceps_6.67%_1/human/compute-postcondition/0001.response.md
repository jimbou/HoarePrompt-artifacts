The first line assigns the integer values of the input to `n` and `m`. Since stdin contains at least one test case, `n` and `m` become integers. The second line initializes an empty list `a`. The third and fourth lines initialize empty strings `first_row` and `last_row`, respectively. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, a is an empty list, first_row is an empty string, last_row is an empty string, stdin contains at least one test case minus the first test case that was read**
