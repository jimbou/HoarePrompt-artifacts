Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains an integer n and m, followed by n strings of length m, consisting of characters 'W' and 'B'.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = []
    first_row = ''
    last_row = ''
    for i in range(n):
        a.append(input())
        first_row += a[-1][0]
        last_row += a[-1][-1]
    if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]:
        print('NO')
    elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and first_row != last_row:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, m is an integer, a is a list containing n strings read from stdin, first_row is a string consisting of the first character of each string read from stdin, last_row is a string consisting of the last character of each string read from stdin, i is n-1, stdin contains at least one test case minus the n test cases that were read. If the first string in a consists of the same character repeated and this string is different from the last string in a, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, m is an integer, a is a list containing n strings, first_row is a string containing n characters, last_row is a string containing n characters, i is n-1, stdin is empty. If the first string in the list a contains only one unique character and the first string is not equal to the last string in the list a, then 'NO' is being printed. Otherwise, either the first string in the list a contains more than one unique character or the first string in the list a is the same as the last string in the list a, and 'YES' is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, m is an integer, a is a list containing n strings, first_row is a string consisting of the first character of each input string, last_row is a string consisting of the last character of each input string, i is n-1, stdin contains no input, _ is 1. If the first string in the list a consists of only one unique character and the first string in the list a is not the same as the last string in the list a, then 'NO' is printed. If the first string in the list a consists of only one unique character and the first string in the list a is not the same as the last string in the list a, and the first_row is equal to the last_row, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, either the length of the set of characters in the first string of a is not equal to 1 or the first string of a is equal to the last string of a, and 'YES' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
