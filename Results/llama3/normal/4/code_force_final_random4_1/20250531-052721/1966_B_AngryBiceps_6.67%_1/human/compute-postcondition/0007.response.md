Output State: **n is an integer greater than 2, m is an integer, a is a list containing three strings read from stdin, first_row is a string consisting of the first character of the first string read from stdin, the first character of the second string read from stdin, and the first character of the third string read from stdin, last_row is a string consisting of the last character of the first string read from stdin, the last character of the second string read from stdin, and the last character of the third string read from stdin, i is 2, stdin contains at least one test case minus the three test cases that were read.**

In this output state, the value of `n` and `m` remains unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The list `a` now contains three strings, including the two initially read from stdin and the additional string read by the code. The `first_row` and `last_row` variables are updated to include the first and last characters of the newly read string, respectively. The value of `i` remains 2 as it is not modified by the code. The stdin now contains at least one test case minus the three test cases that were read.
