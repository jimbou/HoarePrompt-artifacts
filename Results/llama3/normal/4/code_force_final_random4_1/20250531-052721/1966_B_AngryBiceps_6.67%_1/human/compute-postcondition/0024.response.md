According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is -1, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 0 and `n` must be greater than 0.

State: **`n` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is an empty string, `i` is 0, stdin contains at least one test case minus one input**
