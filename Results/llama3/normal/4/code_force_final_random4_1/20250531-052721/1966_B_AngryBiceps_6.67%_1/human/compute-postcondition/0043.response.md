The only variable in the loop head is the variable `_` and the input() function, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input() function. If the input() function returns a value that is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the input() function has returned a value that is greater than or equal to 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time the input() function must return a value that is greater than 0 and the variable `_` is 1.
State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, m is an integer, a is a list containing n strings, first_row is a string containing n characters, last_row is a string containing n characters, i is n-1, stdin is not empty, _ is 1**
