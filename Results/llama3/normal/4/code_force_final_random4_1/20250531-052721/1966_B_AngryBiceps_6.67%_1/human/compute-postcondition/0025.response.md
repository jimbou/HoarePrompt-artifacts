The code snippet provided reads an input from stdin, appends it to the list `a`, and then updates the strings `first_row` and `last_row` by adding the first and last characters of the input string, respectively.

Here's the combined effect of all lines on the program:

*   The first line, `a.append(input())`, reads an input from stdin and appends it to the list `a`. Since `a` was initially an empty list, it now contains one element, which is the input string. Stdin now contains one less input.
*   The second line, `first_row += a[-1][0]`, updates the string `first_row` by adding the first character of the input string (which is the last element in the list `a`). Since `first_row` was initially an empty string, it now contains the first character of the input string.
*   The third line, `last_row += a[-1][-1]`, updates the string `last_row` by adding the last character of the input string (which is the last element in the list `a`). Since `last_row` was initially an empty string, it now contains the last character of the input string.

The values of `n`, `m`, and `i` are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer, a is a list containing one string, first_row is a string containing one character, last_row is a string containing one character, i is 0, stdin contains one less input.**
