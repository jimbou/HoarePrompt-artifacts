Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly checks if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color by performing any number of operations. 

The program checks two conditions:

1. If the first row (first character of each string) is the same as the last row (last character of each string), but the first string is not the same as the last string. This is because if the first row and last row are the same, but the first string and last string are different, it means that there is a row that is completely different from the first and last rows, and it's impossible to make all squares the same color.

2. If the first string consists of only one unique character and is not the same as the last string. This is because if the first string consists of only one unique character and is not the same as the last string, it means that the first string is either all 'W' or all 'B', and the last string is the opposite. In this case, it's impossible to make all squares the same color because there is no way to change the color of the first string.

If neither of these conditions is true, the program prints 'YES', indicating that it's possible to make all squares the same color.

Correctness: **True**
