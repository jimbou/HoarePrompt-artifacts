Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and m, followed by n strings of length m, containing characters 'W' and 'B'. It then checks each test case to determine if the first string is the same as the last string, and if the first row (first character of each string) is the same as the last row (last character of each string). If the first string consists of only one unique character and is not the same as the last string, or if the first row is the same as the last row but the first string is not the same as the last string, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function processes all test cases and prints the corresponding results.**
