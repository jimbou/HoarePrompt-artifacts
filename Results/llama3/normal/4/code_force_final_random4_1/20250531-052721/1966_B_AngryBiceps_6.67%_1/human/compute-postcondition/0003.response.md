Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer, a is a list containing one string read from stdin, first_row is a string consisting of the first character of the string read from stdin, last_row is a string consisting of the last character of the string read from stdin, i is 0, stdin contains at least one test case minus the first test case that was read.**

In this output state, the value of `n` and `m` remains unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The list `a` now contains one string that was read from stdin. The variable `first_row` contains the first character of the string read from stdin, and `last_row` contains the last character of the same string. The value of `i` remains 0 as it is not modified by the code. Stdin now contains at least one test case minus the first test case that was read.
