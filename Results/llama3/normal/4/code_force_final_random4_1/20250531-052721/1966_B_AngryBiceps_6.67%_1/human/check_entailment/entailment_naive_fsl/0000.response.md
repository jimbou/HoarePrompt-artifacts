Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, consider a grid where the first and last rows are the same color, but there is a single cell in the middle that is a different color. The program will incorrectly print "YES" in this case, because it only checks the first and last rows, and does not consider the middle rows.

For instance, consider the following input:

3 3
BBB
WBW
BBB

The program will print "YES", but it is not possible to make all squares in the grid the same color by performing any number of operations.

The program needs to be modified to check all rows and columns, not just the first and last ones, to correctly determine if it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color.
