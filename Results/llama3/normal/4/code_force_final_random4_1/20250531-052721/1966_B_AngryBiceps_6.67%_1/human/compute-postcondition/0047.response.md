According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list containing one string, `first_row` is a string consisting of the first character of the input string, `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of the input string, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains no input, `_` is 1**
