To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states accordingly.


The loop head is `for i in range(n):`. The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.


At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Since `n` is greater than 1, it must also be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.


The other variables `m`, `a`, `first_row`, `last_row`, and `stdin` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.


State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list containing two strings read from stdin, `first_row` is a string consisting of the first character of the first string read from stdin and the first character of the second string read from stdin, `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of the first string read from stdin and the last character of the second string read from stdin, `i` is 2, stdin contains at least one test case minus the two test cases that were read.**
