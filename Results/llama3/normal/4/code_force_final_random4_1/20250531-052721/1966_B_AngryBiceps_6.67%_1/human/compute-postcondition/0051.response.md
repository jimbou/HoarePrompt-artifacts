Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, m is an integer, a is a list containing n strings, first_row is a string consisting of the first character of each input string, last_row is a string consisting of the last character of each input string, i is n-1, stdin contains no input, _ is 1**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `a` will contain `n` strings, where `n` is the initial value of the variable `n`. The string `first_row` will consist of the first character of each input string, and the string `last_row` will consist of the last character of each input string. The variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, and the standard input `stdin` will be empty. The value of the variable `_` will remain unchanged at 1.
