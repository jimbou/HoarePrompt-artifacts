To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable in the loop head, which is the input from stdin.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input from stdin. If the input from stdin contains at least one test case, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains multiple test cases. So for the loop to be executed, stdin must contain at least one test case.

State: **stdin contains at least one test case**
