Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the required logic to find any two indices i and j such that p_i âŠ• p_j is maximized. The program uses a series of queries to compare the bitwise OR of different pairs of indices and updates the maximum value accordingly. The program also ensures that it does not exceed the maximum allowed number of queries, which is 3n.

The program first finds the index with the maximum value by comparing each index with the current maximum. Then, it finds the indices that have the same maximum value as the previously found maximum. Finally, it finds the index that has the maximum XOR value with the previously found maximum index.

The program correctly handles the input and output operations, including printing the queries and the final answer, and flushing the output to avoid idleness limit exceeded errors.

Correctness: **True**
