#State of the program right berfore the function call: a, b, c, and d are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c, d < n, where n is a positive integer.
    print('?', a, b, c, d)
    #This is printed: ? a b c d (where a, b, c, and d are non-negative integers less than n)
    return input()
    #The program returns a string that is the input provided by the user, which is a sequence of four non-negative integers a, b, c, and d, separated by spaces, where 0 <= a, b, c, d < n, and n is a positive integer.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function prompts the user to input a sequence of four non-negative integers a, b, c, and d, separated by spaces, where 0 <= a, b, c, d < n, and n is a positive integer, and returns the user's input as a string.
