The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be at least 3.
State: **`ii` is 0, `n` is at least 3, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `k` is 0 or decreased by the product of `i + 1` and the difference between `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]`, `r` is set to `a[i] + k // (i + 1)` or set to the integer at index `i + 1` in `a`, `rem` is set to `k % (i + 1)` or set to 0, and `y` is set to `n - 1 - i` or set to 0**
