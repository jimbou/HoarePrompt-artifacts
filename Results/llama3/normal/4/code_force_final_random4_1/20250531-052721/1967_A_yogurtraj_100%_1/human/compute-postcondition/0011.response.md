Postcondition: ***`ii` is 0, `n` is at least 3, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is less than or equal to `k`, then `k` is 0, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, and `y` is `n - 1 - i`. Otherwise, `k` is decreased by the product of `i + 1` and the difference between `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]`, `r` is set to the integer at index `i + 1` in `a`, `rem` is set to 0, and `y` is set to `n - 1 - i`.***
