Output: **`ii` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is not 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`, `rem` is 0, `y` is `n - 1 - ii`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, and this is printed: `(r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n` where `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n` and `k % n` is the remainder of `k` divided by `n`**
