The only variable in the loop head is variable  ii, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ii`. If `ii` is less than the number of test cases, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ii` is 0, and the number of test cases is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `ii` must be increased by 1.
State: **`ii` is 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1**
