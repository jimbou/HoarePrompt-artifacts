Based on the initial state, we can analyze the print statement as follows:

* `r` is the smallest integer in the sorted list `a`. Since `a` is sorted, the smallest integer is the first element of the list.
* `rem` is 0.
* `y` is `n - 1 - i`, where `i` is 0. Therefore, `y` is `n - 1`.
* `n` is an integer.

Now, let's substitute these values into the print statement:

`print((r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y)`

* `(r - 1)` is the second smallest integer in the list `a` (since `r` is the smallest integer).
* `n` is an integer.
* `1` is a constant.
* `rem` is 0.
* `y` is `n - 1`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the result of the expression:

`(second smallest integer in a) * n + 1 + 0 + (n - 1)`

Simplifying the expression, we get:

`(second smallest integer in a) * n + n`

Output: **(second smallest integer in a) * n + n**
