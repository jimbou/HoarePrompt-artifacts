The code prints the expression `(r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y` where `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, and `y` is `n - 1 - i`. Since `k` is 0, `r` simplifies to `a[i] // (i + 1)`, and `rem` is 0. Substituting these values, the expression becomes `(a[i] // (i + 1) - 1) * n + 1 + n - 1 - i`. 

Since `ii` is `n`, `i` is `n - 1` (because `y` is `n - 1 - i`). Substituting `i` as `n - 1`, the expression becomes `(a[n - 1] // n - 1) * n + 1 + n - 1 - (n - 1)`. 

Simplifying further, the expression becomes `(a[n - 1] // n - 1) * n + 1`. 

Since `a` is a sorted list of integers, `a[n - 1]` is the largest integer in the list. 

Output: **(a[n - 1] // n - 1) * n + 1 (where a[n - 1] is the largest integer in the sorted list a)**
