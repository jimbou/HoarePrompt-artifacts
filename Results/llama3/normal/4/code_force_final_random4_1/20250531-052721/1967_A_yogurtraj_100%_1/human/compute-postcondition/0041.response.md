Output State: **`ii` is `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers equal to the second input, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k` at any point during the loop, then `k` is 0, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, and `y` is `n - 1 - i`. Otherwise, `k` is reduced by `(n - 1) * (a[n - 1] - a[n - 2])`, `r` is the integer at index `n - 1` in `a`, `rem` is `k % (n - 1)`, and `y` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

* The loop counter `ii` is equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has executed `n` times.
* The value of `n` is greater than 0, indicating that the loop has executed at least once.
* The list `a` remains a sorted list of integers equal to the second input.
* The `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, indicating that the loop has executed for multiple test cases.
* If at any point during the loop, `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`, then `k` is set to 0, `r` is set to `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is set to `k % (i + 1)`, and `y` is set to `n - 1 - i`. This indicates that the loop has found a point where the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is greater than `k`, and has updated the values of `r`, `rem`, and `y` accordingly.
* If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is never greater than `k` during the loop, then `k` is reduced by `(n - 1) * (a[n - 1] - a[n - 2])`, `r` is set to the integer at index `n - 1` in `a`, `rem` is set to `k % (n - 1)`, and `y` is set to 0. This indicates that the loop has executed for all elements in `a` without finding a point where the difference between consecutive elements is greater than `k`.
