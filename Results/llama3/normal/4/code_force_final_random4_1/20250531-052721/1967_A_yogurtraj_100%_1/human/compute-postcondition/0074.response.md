Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers equal to the second input, ii is n+1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, i is n-1, r is a value, rem is a value, y is a value. If k is not equal to 0, the value of the expression (r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n is printed, where r is an integer equal to a[n - 1] + k // n. If k is equal to 0, the value of the expression (r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y is printed.***
