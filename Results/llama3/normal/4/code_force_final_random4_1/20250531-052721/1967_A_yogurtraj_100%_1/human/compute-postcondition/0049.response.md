Postcondition: ***`ii` is `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers equal to the second input, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2. If `k` is not equal to 0, the value of the expression `(a[n - 1] - 1) * n + 1 + k % n` is being printed, where `k` is either 0 or reduced by `(n - 1) * (a[n - 1] - a[n - 2])`. If `k` is 0, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, and `y` is `n - 1 - i`, and this is printed: `((a[i] + k // (i + 1)) - 1) * n + 1 + (k % (i + 1)) + (n - 1 - i)`***
