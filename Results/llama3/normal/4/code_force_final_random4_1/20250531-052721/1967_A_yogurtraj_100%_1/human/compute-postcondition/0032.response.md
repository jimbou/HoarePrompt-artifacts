Postcondition: ***`ii` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers equal to the second input, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`, then `k` is 0, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, and `y` is `n - 1 - i`. Otherwise, `k` is reduced by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is the integer at index `i + 1` in `a`, `rem` is 0, and `y` is 0.***
