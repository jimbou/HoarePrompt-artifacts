Functionality: **This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains n integers. The function sorts the integers, then iterates through them to find the maximum value that can be achieved by adding k to the smallest integer. If k is not exhausted, it adds the remaining value to the last integer. The function prints the calculated value for each test case.**
