The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be at least 2.
State: **`ii` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is less than or equal to `k`, then `k` is 0, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, and `y` is `n - 1 - i`. Otherwise, `k` is decreased by the product of `i + 1` and the difference between `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]`, `r` is set to the integer at index `i + 1` in `a`, `rem` is set to 0, and `y` is set to `n - 1 - i`.**
