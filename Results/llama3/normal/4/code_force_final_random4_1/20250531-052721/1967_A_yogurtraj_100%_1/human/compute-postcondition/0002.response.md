To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 2 (since the loop goes up to `n - 1`).

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`ii` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is the smallest integer in `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `i` is 0**
