To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 2 (since the loop runs from 0 to `n-1`). Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be greater than 1.

State: **`ii` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of integers equal to the second input, `r` is the smallest integer in `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `i` is 0**
