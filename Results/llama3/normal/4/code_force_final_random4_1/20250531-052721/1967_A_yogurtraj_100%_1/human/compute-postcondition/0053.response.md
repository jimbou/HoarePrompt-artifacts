Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers equal to the second input, `ii` is `n+1`, `r` is the smallest integer in `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `i` is 0. The current value of `i` is such that the product of `i+1` and the difference between the `i+1`th and `i`th elements of `a` is greater than `k`.***
