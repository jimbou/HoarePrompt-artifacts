Output: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `k` is an integer not equal to 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers equal to the second input, `ii` is `n+1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `i` is `n-1`, `r` is an integer equal to `a[n - 1] + k // n`, `rem` is a value, and `y` is a value, and this is printed: the value of the expression `(r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n` which is equal to `(a[n - 1] + k // n - 1) * n + 1 + k % n`**
