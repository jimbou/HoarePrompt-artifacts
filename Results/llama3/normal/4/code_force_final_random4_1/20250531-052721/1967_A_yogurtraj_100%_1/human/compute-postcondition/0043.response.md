Output State: **`ii` is `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers equal to the second input, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2. The current value of `k` is not 0. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k` at any point during the loop, then the current value of `k` is 0, `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`, `rem` is `k % n`, and `y` is `n - 1 - ii`. Otherwise, the current value of `k` is reduced by `(n - 1) * (a[n - 1] - a[n - 2])`, `r` is the integer at index `n - 1` in `a`, `rem` is `k % (n - 1)`, and `y` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `r` has been updated to `a[n - 1] + k // n`, which is the integer at index `n - 1` in `a` plus the integer division of `k` by `n`. The value of `rem` has also been updated to `k % n`, which is the remainder of `k` divided by `n`. The value of `y` is still `n - 1 - ii`, which is the difference between `n - 1` and the current value of `ii`. The other variables remain unchanged.
