Postcondition: **ii is 0, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1. If k is not 0, r is a[n - 1] + k // n and the output is (r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n. If k is 0, r is the smallest integer in a and the output is (r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y, where y is n - 1 - ii.**
