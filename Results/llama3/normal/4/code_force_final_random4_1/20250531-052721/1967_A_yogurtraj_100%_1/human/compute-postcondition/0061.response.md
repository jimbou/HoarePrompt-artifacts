Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers equal to the second input, ii is n+1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, i is 1, r is a value, rem is a value, y is a value. If (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k, then k is 0, r is a[i] + k // (i + 1), rem is k % (i + 1), and y is n - 1 - i. Otherwise, k is updated to its original value minus (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]), r is a[i + 1], and rem and y are updated to some values.***
