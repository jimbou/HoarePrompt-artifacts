Output State: **ii is 1, n is an integer equal to the first input, k is an integer equal to the second input, a is a sorted list of integers equal to the second input, r is the smallest integer in a, rem is 0, y is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2**

In this output state, the value of `n` and `k` are updated to the first and second input integers respectively. The list `a` is updated to the second input, which is a sorted list of integers. The variable `r` is assigned the smallest integer in `a`. The variables `rem` and `y` are initialized to 0. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus 2, as two inputs have been consumed. The value of `ii` remains unchanged.
