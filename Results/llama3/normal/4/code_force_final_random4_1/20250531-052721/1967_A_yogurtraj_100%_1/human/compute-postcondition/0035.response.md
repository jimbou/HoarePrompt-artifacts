Output State: **ii is 2, n is greater than 2, a is a sorted list of integers equal to the second input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, k is reduced by (ii + 1) * (a[ii + 1] - a[ii]), r is the integer at index ii + 1 in a, rem is either k % (ii + 1) or 0, and y is either n - 1 - ii or 0**

In this output state, the value of `ii` remains unchanged at 2. The value of `n` is still greater than 2. The list `a` remains a sorted list of integers equal to the second input. The number of test cases in `stdin` is reduced by 2. The value of `k` is reduced by `(ii + 1) * (a[ii + 1] - a[ii])`, which is equivalent to `(2 + 1) * (a[2 + 1] - a[2])` or `3 * (a[3] - a[2])`. The value of `r` is updated to the integer at index `ii + 1` in `a`, which is `a[2 + 1]` or `a[3]`. The value of `rem` is either `k % (ii + 1)` or 0, and the value of `y` is either `n - 1 - ii` or 0.
