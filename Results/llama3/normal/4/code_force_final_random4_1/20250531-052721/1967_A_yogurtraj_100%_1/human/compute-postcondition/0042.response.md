Postcondition: **`ii` is `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers equal to the second input, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2. The current value of `k` is not 0. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k` at any point during the loop, then the current value of `k` is 0, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, and `y` is `n - 1 - i`. Otherwise, the current value of `k` is reduced by `(n - 1) * (a[n - 1] - a[n - 2])`, `r` is the integer at index `n - 1` in `a`, `rem` is `k % (n - 1)`, and `y` is 0.**
