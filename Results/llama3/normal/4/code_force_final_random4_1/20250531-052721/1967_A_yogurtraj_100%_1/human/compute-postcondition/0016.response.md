Output State: **ii is 0, n is an integer, k is 0, a is a sorted list of integers, r is the smallest integer in a, rem is 0, y is n - 1 - i, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `ii` remains 0, `n` remains an integer, `k` is set to 0, `a` remains a sorted list of integers, `r` is set to the smallest integer in `a`, `rem` is set to 0, `y` is set to `n - 1 - i`, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1.
