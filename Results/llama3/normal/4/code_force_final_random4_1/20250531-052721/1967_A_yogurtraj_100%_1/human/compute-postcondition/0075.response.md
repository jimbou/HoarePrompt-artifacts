Output State: **ii is equal to the number of test cases, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers equal to the last input, stdin contains 0 test cases. If k is not equal to 0, the value of the expression (a[n - 1] - 1) * n + 1 + k % n is printed, where k is either 0 or reduced by (n - 1) * (a[n - 1] - a[n - 2]). If k is 0, r is a[i] + k // (i + 1), rem is k % (i + 1), and y is n - 1 - i, and this is printed: ((a[i] + k // (i + 1)) - 1) * n + 1 + (k % (i + 1)) + (n - 1 - i)**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop counter `ii` is equal to the number of test cases, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers equal to the last input, and `stdin` contains 0 test cases. The output depends on the value of `k`. If `k` is not equal to 0, the output is the value of the expression `(a[n - 1] - 1) * n + 1 + k % n`, where `k` is either 0 or reduced by `(n - 1) * (a[n - 1] - a[n - 2])`. If `k` is 0, the output is the value of the expression `((a[i] + k // (i + 1)) - 1) * n + 1 + (k % (i + 1)) + (n - 1 - i)`, where `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, and `y` is `n - 1 - i`.
