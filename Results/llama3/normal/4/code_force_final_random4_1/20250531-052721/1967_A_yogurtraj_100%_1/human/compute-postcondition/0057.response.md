Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers equal to the second input, ii is n+1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2. If (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k, then r is a[i] + k // (i + 1), rem is k % (i + 1), y is n - 1 - i, and i is 0. Otherwise, r is the second smallest integer in a, rem is 0, y is 0, and i is 0.***
