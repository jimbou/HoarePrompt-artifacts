Postcondition: ***`ii` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers equal to the second input, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`, then `k` is 0, `r` is `a[ii] + k // (ii + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (ii + 1)`, and `y` is `n - 1 - ii`. Otherwise, `k` is reduced by `(ii + 1) * (a[ii + 1] - a[ii])`, `r` is the integer at index `ii + 1` in `a`, `rem` is `k % (ii + 1)`, and `y` is `n - 1 - ii`.***
