Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 0 <= k <= 10^12). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^12).
Code of the loop:
for ii in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    r = a[0]
    rem = 0
    y = 0
    for i in range(0, n - 1):
        if (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k:
            r = a[i] + k // (i + 1)
            rem = k % (i + 1)
            y = n - 1 - i
            k = 0
            break
        else:
            k -= (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])
            r = a[i + 1]
    if k != 0:
        r = a[n - 1] + k // n
        print((r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n)
    else:
        print((r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: ii is 0, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1. If k is not 0, r is a[n - 1] + k // n and the output is (r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n. If k is 0, r is the smallest integer in a and the output is (r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y, where y is n - 1 - ii.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`ii` is `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers equal to the second input, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2. If `k` is not equal to 0, the value of the expression `(a[n - 1] - 1) * n + 1 + k % n` is being printed, where `k` is either 0 or reduced by `(n - 1) * (a[n - 1] - a[n - 2])`. If `k` is 0, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, and `y` is `n - 1 - i`, and this is printed: `((a[i] + k // (i + 1)) - 1) * n + 1 + (k % (i + 1)) + (n - 1 - i)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers equal to the second input, ii is n+1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, i is n-1, r is a value, rem is a value, y is a value. If k is not equal to 0, the value of the expression (r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n is printed, where r is an integer equal to a[n - 1] + k // n. If k is equal to 0, the value of the expression (r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
