Output: **`ii` is `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers equal to the second input, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2. `k` is 0, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, and `y` is `n - 1 - i`, and this is printed: `((a[i] + k // (i + 1)) - 1) * n + 1 + (k % (i + 1)) + (n - 1 - i)`**
