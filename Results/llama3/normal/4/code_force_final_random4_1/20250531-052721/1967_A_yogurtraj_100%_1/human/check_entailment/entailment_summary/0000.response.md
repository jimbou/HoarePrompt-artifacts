Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the score by rearranging cards in a line. The score is calculated as the number of contiguous subarrays of length n that are a permutation of [1, 2, ..., n].

The program first reads the number of test cases and then iterates through each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of distinct types of cards (n) and the number of coins (k). It then reads the number of cards of each type.

The program sorts the number of cards of each type in ascending order. It then iterates through the sorted list to find the maximum value that can be achieved by adding k to the smallest integer. If k is not exhausted, it adds the remaining value to the last integer.

The program calculates the maximum score by multiplying the maximum value by n and adding 1. If k is not exhausted, it adds the remaining value modulo n to the result.

The program prints the calculated maximum score for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
