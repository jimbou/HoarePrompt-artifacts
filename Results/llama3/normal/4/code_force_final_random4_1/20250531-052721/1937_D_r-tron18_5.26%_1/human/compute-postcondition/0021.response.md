Output State: **`s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `s1` and must be at least 2, `pre` is a list of 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the count of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `suffZero` is a list containing a single element 0 if the last character of `s1` is '>', otherwise it contains two elements: 0 and `n`, `ans` is a list of `n` elements where the last element is calculated based on the last character of `s1` and the count of '>' characters in `s1`, `i` is `n - 2`, `el` is the character at index `n-2` in `s1`, `ol` is the count of '>' characters in `s1`, and `zr` is 0 if the last character of `s1` is '>', otherwise it is 1.**

In this output state, the values of `ol` and `zr` have been updated. `ol` is now equal to the count of '>' characters in `s1`, which is the same as `totalOne`. `zr` is now equal to 0 if the last character of `s1` is '>', otherwise it is 1, which is the same as the last element of `suffZero` minus 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
