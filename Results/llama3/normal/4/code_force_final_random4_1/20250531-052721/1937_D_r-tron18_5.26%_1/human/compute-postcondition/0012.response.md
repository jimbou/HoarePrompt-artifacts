Output State: **s1 is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer equal to the length of s1 and must be at least 1, pre is a list of 1-based indices of '>' characters in s1, totalOne is the count of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of 1-based indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing two elements: 0 and n, ans is a list of n zeros, i is n - 1, el is '<', ol is the count of '>' characters in s1, zr is 1.**

The code modifies the state of the variables as follows:

- The first line appends the value of `suffZero[-1] + i + 1` to `suffZero`. Since `suffZero` initially contains a single element 0, and `i` is `n - 1`, the new element appended to `suffZero` is `0 + (n - 1) + 1 = n`. Therefore, `suffZero` now contains two elements: 0 and `n`.

- The second line assigns the value of `totalOne` to `ol`, and the value of `len(suffZero) - 1` to `zr`. Since `totalOne` is the count of '>' characters in `s1`, `ol` becomes the count of '>' characters in `s1`. The value of `len(suffZero) - 1` is 1, so `zr` becomes 1.

All other variables remain unchanged.
