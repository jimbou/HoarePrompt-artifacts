Output State: **s1 is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer equal to the length of s1 and must be at least 1, pre is a list of 1-based indices of '>' characters in s1, totalOne is the count of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of 1-based indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing a single element 0, ans is a list of n elements where the last element is zeroInd - oneInd, i is n - 1, el is '>', ol is the count of '>' characters in s1 and is less than or equal to zr, and zr is 0.**

In this output state, the values of `s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, `el`, `ol`, and `zr` remain unchanged from the initial state. The value of `i` also remains unchanged as `n - 1`. The only change is in the list `ans`, where the last element (at index `i`) is updated to `zeroInd - oneInd`. The values of `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are calculated based on the given functions `func_1` and the previous values of `suffZero`, `preOne`, and `ol`.
