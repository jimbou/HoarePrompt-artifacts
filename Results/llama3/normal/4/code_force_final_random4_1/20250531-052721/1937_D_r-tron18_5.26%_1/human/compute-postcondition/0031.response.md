The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 2`, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again `i` must be `n - 3` and `n` must be at least 3.
State: **`s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `s1` and must be at least 3, `pre` is a list of 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the count of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `suffZero` is a list containing a single element 0 if the last character of `s1` is '>', otherwise it contains two elements: 0 and `n-1`, `ans` is a list of `n` elements where the last element is calculated based on the last character of `s1` and the count of '>' characters in `s1`, `i` is `n - 3`, `el` is the character at index `n-3` in `s1`, and `zr` is 0 if the last character of `s1` is '>', otherwise it is 1.**
