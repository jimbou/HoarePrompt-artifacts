Output State: **s1 is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer equal to the length of s1 and must be at least 1, pre is a list of 1-based indices of '>' characters in s1, totalOne is the count of '>' characters in s1 minus 1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of 1-based indices of '>' characters in s1 with the last element removed, suffZero is a list containing a single element 0, ans is a list of n elements where the last element is zeroInd - oneInd if the count of '>' characters in s1 is less than or equal to 0, otherwise the last element is zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi, i is n - 1, el is '>', and zr is 0.**

The code snippet modifies the state of the variables `totalOne` and `preOne`. The first line removes the last element from the list `preOne`, which contains the cumulative sums of 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`. The second line decrements the value of `totalOne` by 1, which represents the count of '>' characters in `s1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
