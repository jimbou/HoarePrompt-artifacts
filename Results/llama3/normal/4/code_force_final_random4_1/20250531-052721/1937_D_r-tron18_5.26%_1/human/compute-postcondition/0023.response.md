Output State: **s1 is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer equal to the length of s1 and must be at least 2, pre is a list of 1-based indices of '>' characters in s1, totalOne is the count of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of 1-based indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing a single element 0 if the last character of s1 is '>', otherwise it contains two elements: 0 and n, ans is a list of n elements where the last element is calculated based on the last character of s1 and the count of '>' characters in s1, i is n - 2, el is the character at index n-2 in s1, ol is the count of '>' characters in s1, zr is 0 if the last character of s1 is '>', otherwise it is 1, zeroInd is 2 * suffZero[-1], oneInd is func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1), fi is func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr), and ans[i] is zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi.**

The code block modifies the values of `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, `fi`, and `ans[i]`. The value of `zeroInd` is calculated as twice the last element of `suffZero`, which depends on the last character of `s1`. The value of `oneInd` is calculated using the `func_1` function with different indices of `preOne` and `zr`. The value of `fi` is calculated as the difference between two calls to `func_1` with different indices of `preOne` and `zr`. Finally, the value of `ans[i]` is calculated using the values of `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, `n`, and `fi`. The other variables remain unchanged.
