Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when the input string contains only '>' characters. In this case, the `pre` list will be empty, and the `preOne` list will not be initialized correctly. This will cause an error when trying to access `preOne[-1]` in the line `oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`.

For example, if the input is `n = 5` and `s1 = '>>>>>'`, the program will raise an `IndexError` when trying to access `preOne[-1]`.
