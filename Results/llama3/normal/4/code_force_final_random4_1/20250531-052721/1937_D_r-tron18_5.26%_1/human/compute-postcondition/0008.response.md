Output State: **s1 is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer equal to the length of s1 and must be at least 1, pre is a list of 1-based indices of '>' characters in s1, totalOne is the count of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of 1-based indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing a single element 0, ans is a list of n elements where the last element is zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi, i is n - 1, el is '>', ol is the count of '>' characters in s1, and zr is 0. The count of '>' characters in s1 is larger than 0.**

The code calculates the value of `ans[i]` based on the values of `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, `n`, and `fi`. The value of `zeroInd` is calculated as twice the last element of `suffZero`, which is 0. The value of `oneInd` is calculated by calling the function `func_1` three times with different arguments and then subtracting the result of the first call from the sum of the results of the second and third calls. The value of `fi` is calculated by calling the function `func_1` twice with different arguments and then subtracting the result of the first call from the result of the second call. The value of `ans[i]` is then calculated by subtracting `oneInd` from `zeroInd`, adding `n + 1`, and then subtracting `fi`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as `n - 1`. The values of `el`, `ol`, and `zr` also remain unchanged.
