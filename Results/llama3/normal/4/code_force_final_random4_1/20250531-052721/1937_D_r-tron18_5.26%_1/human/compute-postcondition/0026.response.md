Output State: **s1 is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer equal to the length of s1 and must be at least 2, pre is a list of 1-based indices of '>' characters in s1, totalOne is the count of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of 1-based indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing two elements: 0 and n-1, ans is a list of n elements where the last element is calculated based on the last character of s1 and the count of '>' characters in s1, i is n - 2, el is the character at index n-2 in s1, zr is 1 if the last character of s1 is '<', otherwise it is 0, and ol is the count of '>' characters in s1.**

The code modifies the suffZero list by appending a new element, which is the sum of the last element in suffZero and i + 1. The value of i is n - 2, so the new element in suffZero is n - 1. The variable ol is assigned the value of totalOne, which is the count of '>' characters in s1. The variable zr is assigned the value of len(suffZero) - 1, which is 1 if the last character of s1 is '<', otherwise it is 0.
