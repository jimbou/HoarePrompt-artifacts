The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than -1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is n - 1, n is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be decreased by 1 so `i` is n - 2 and for the loop to execute again n must be at least 2.
State: **s1 is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer equal to the length of s1 and must be at least 2, pre is a list of 1-based indices of '>' characters in s1, totalOne is the count of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of 1-based indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing a single element 0 if the last character of s1 is '>', otherwise it contains two elements: 0 and n, ans is a list of n elements where the last element is calculated based on the last character of s1 and the count of '>' characters in s1, i is n - 2, el is either '<' or '>' depending on the character at index n-2 in s1, and zr is 0 if the last character of s1 is '>', otherwise it is 1.**
