Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of calculating the number of seconds it takes for a pinball to leave a one-dimensional grid of length n, where each cell contains a character '<' or '>'. The program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2.

func_1 calculates the difference between the last element of a list and an element at a dynamically calculated index, which is determined by the list length and a given non-negative integer.

func_2 calculates and returns a list of values based on the input string s1, which consists of '<' and '>' characters. It iterates through the string from right to left, maintaining a count of '>' characters and their cumulative indices. For each character, it calculates a value based on the count of '>' characters, the cumulative indices, and the position of the character in the string.

The program uses these functions to solve the problem. It first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the length of the grid and the string s1. It then calls func_2 to calculate the list of values, which are then printed.

Based on the execution summaries of the functions, it appears that the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. The functions seem to be correctly calculating the values based on the input string and the rules of the problem.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
