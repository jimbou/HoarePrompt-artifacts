Postcondition: **`s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `s1` and must be at least 1, `pre` is a list of 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the count of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `suffZero` is a list containing a single element 0, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `i` is `n - 1`, and the current value of `el` is '>' (indicating that the character at index `n-1` in `s1` is '>').**
