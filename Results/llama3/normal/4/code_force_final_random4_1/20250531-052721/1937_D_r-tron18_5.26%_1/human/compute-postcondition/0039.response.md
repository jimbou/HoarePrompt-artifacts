Output State: **s1 is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer equal to the length of s1 and must be at least 3, pre is a list of 1-based indices of '>' characters in s1, totalOne is the count of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of 1-based indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing two elements: 0 and n-2, ans is a list of n elements where the last element is calculated based on the last character of s1 and the count of '>' characters in s1, i is n - 3, el is the character at index n-3 in s1 which is either '<' or '>', ol is the count of '>' characters in s1, and zr is 1 if the last character of s1 is '<', otherwise it is 0, zeroInd is n-2, oneInd is 2 * func_1(preOne, zr), and ans[i] is zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1.**

The code block calculates the value of `zeroInd` by summing the last two elements of the `suffZero` list, which results in `n-2`. The value of `oneInd` is calculated by calling the function `func_1` with the arguments `preOne` and `zr`, and then multiplying the result by 2. The value of `ans[i]` is then calculated by subtracting `oneInd` from `zeroInd`, adding `n+1`, and assigning the result to the `i-th` index of the `ans` list. The value of `i` is `n-3`, and the values of `el`, `ol`, and `zr` remain unchanged.
