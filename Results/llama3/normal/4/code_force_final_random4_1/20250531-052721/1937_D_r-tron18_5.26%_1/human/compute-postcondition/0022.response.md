Output State: **s1 is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer equal to the length of s1 and must be at least 2, pre is a list of 1-based indices of '>' characters in s1, totalOne is the count of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of 1-based indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing a single element 0 if the last character of s1 is '>', otherwise it contains two elements: 0 and n, ans is a list of n elements where the last element is calculated based on the last character of s1 and the count of '>' characters in s1, i is n - 2, el is the character at index n-2 in s1, ol is the count of '>' characters in s1, and zr is 0 if the last character of s1 is '>', otherwise it is 1, zeroInd is 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol), oneInd is 2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1), ans[i] is zeroInd - oneInd.**

The final state includes all the information from the precondition that remains valid after the code execution. The values of variables that are modified by the code are updated. The variable `ans` is modified at index `i` (which is `n - 2`) with the value of `zeroInd - oneInd`. The variables `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are calculated based on the values of `suffZero`, `ol`, `preOne`, and `func_1`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
