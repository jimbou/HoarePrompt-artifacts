Output State: **`s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `s1` and must be at least 3, `pre` is a list of 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the count of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `suffZero` is a list containing a single element 0 if the last character of `s1` is '>', otherwise it contains two elements: 0 and `n-1`, `ans` is a list of `n` elements where the last element is calculated based on the last character of `s1` and the count of '>' characters in `s1`, `i` is `n - 3`, `el` is the character at index `n-3` in `s1` which is either '<' or '>', and `zr` is 0 if the last character of `s1` is '>', otherwise it is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `el` has been updated to the character at index `n-3` in `s1`, which can be either '<' or '>'. The other variables remain unchanged.
