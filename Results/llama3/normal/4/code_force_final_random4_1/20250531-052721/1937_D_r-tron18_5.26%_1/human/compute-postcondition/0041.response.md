Postcondition: ***s1 is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer equal to the length of s1 and must be at least 3, pre is a list of 1-based indices of '>' characters in s1, totalOne is the count of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of 1-based indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing two elements: 0 and n-2, ans is a list of n elements where the last element is calculated based on the last character of s1 and the count of '>' characters in s1, i is n - 3, el is the character at index n-3 in s1 which is either '<' or '>', ol is the count of '>' characters in s1, and zr is 1 if the last character of s1 is '<', otherwise it is 0. If zr is less than or equal to ol, then zeroInd is n-2, oneInd is 2 * func_1(preOne, zr), and ans[i] is zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1. Otherwise, zeroInd is 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1), oneInd is 2 * preOne[-1], and ans[i] is zeroInd - oneInd.***
