Output State: **s1 is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer equal to the length of s1 and must be at least 2, pre is a list of 1-based indices of '>' characters in s1, totalOne is the count of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of 1-based indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing two elements: 0 and n-1, ans is a list of n elements where the last element is calculated based on the last character of s1 and the count of '>' characters in s1, i is n - 2, el is the character at index n-2 in s1, zr is 1 if the last character of s1 is '<', otherwise it is 0, and ol is the count of '>' characters in s1, zeroInd is the sum of the last two elements of suffZero, oneInd is twice the result of func_1(preOne, zr), and ans[i] is the result of zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1.**

In this output state, the values of s1, n, pre, totalOne, preOne, suffZero, ans, i, el, zr, and ol remain unchanged from the initial state. The code only modifies the values of zeroInd, oneInd, and ans[i]. The value of zeroInd is calculated as the sum of the last two elements of suffZero, which are 0 and n-1, resulting in n-1. The value of oneInd is calculated as twice the result of func_1(preOne, zr), but the exact value of oneInd cannot be determined without knowing the implementation of func_1. The value of ans[i] is calculated as zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1, which is n - oneInd.
