#Overall this is what the function does:Calculates the difference between the last element of a list and an element at a dynamically calculated index, which is determined by the list length and a given non-negative integer, and returns this difference.

    #This is printed: [calculated values of ans] (where each value is calculated based on the corresponding character in s1 and the count of '>' characters in s1)

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns a list of values based on the input string s1, which consists of '<' and '>' characters. The function iterates through the string from right to left, maintaining a count of '>' characters and their cumulative indices. For each character, it calculates a value based on the count of '>' characters, the cumulative indices, and the position of the character in the string. The calculated values are stored in a list, which is then returned. The function does not modify the input string.
