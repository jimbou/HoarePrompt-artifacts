Output State: **`s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `s1` and must be at least 1, `pre` is a list of 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the count of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `suffZero` is a list containing a single element 0, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `i` is `n - 1`, `el` is either '<' or '>' depending on the character at index `n-1` in `s1`.**

In this output state, the value of `el` is determined by the character at index `n-1` in the string `s1`. If the character at index `n-1` is '<', then `el` is '<'. If the character at index `n-1` is '>', then `el` is '>'. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
