The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the `ans` list.

Based on the precondition, `ans` is a list of `n` elements, where each element is calculated based on the corresponding character in the string `s1` and the count of '>' characters in `s1`.

Since the exact string `s1` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the elements in `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated values of `ans`.

Output: **[calculated values of ans] (where each value is calculated based on the corresponding character in s1 and the count of '>' characters in s1)**
