Output State: **s1 is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer equal to the length of s1 and must be at least 3, pre is a list of 1-based indices of '>' characters in s1, totalOne is the count of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of 1-based indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing a single element 0 if the last character of s1 is '>', otherwise it contains two elements: 0 and n-1, ans is a list of n elements where the last element is calculated based on the last character of s1 and the count of '>' characters in s1, i is n - 3, el is the character at index n-3 in s1 which is either '<' or '>', zr is 1 if the last character of s1 is '<', otherwise it is 0, ol is the count of '>' characters in s1, zeroInd is 2 times the last element of suffZero, oneInd is the sum of func_1(preOne, zr) and func_1(preOne, zr + 1) minus func_1(preOne, 1), fi is the difference between func_1(preOne, zr + 1) and func_1(preOne, zr), and ans[i] is zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi.**
