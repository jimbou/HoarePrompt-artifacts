Output State: **s1 is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer equal to the length of s1 and must be at least 1, pre is a list of 1-based indices of '>' characters in s1, totalOne is the count of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of 1-based indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing two elements: 0 and n, ans is a list of n elements where the element at index i is equal to zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1, i is n - 1, el is '<', ol is the count of '>' characters in s1, zr is 1. The current value of zr is less than or equal to the current value of ol.**

In this output state, the value of `ans[i]` has been updated based on the calculations involving `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, `n`, and `func_1(preOne, zr)`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and properties as specified in the precondition.
