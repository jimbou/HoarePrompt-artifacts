Output State: **s1 is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer equal to the length of s1 and must be at least 2, pre is a list of 1-based indices of '>' characters in s1, totalOne is the count of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of 1-based indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing two elements: 0 and n-1, ans is a list of n elements where the last element is calculated based on the last character of s1 and the count of '>' characters in s1, i is n - 2, el is the character at index n-2 in s1, zr is 1 if the last character of s1 is '<', otherwise it is 0, and ol is the count of '>' characters in s1, zeroInd is 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1), oneInd is 2 * preOne[-1], and ans[i] is zeroInd - oneInd.**

The code calculates the value of `zeroInd` by calling the function `func_1` twice with different arguments and then subtracting the results. It also calculates the value of `oneInd` by multiplying the last element of `preOne` by 2. Finally, it assigns the difference between `zeroInd` and `oneInd` to `ans[i]`. The values of `s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, `i`, `el`, `zr`, and `ol` remain unchanged.
