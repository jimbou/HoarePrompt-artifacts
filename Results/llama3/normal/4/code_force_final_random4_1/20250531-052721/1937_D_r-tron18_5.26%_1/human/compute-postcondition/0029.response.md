Postcondition: **s1 is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer equal to the length of s1 and must be at least 2, pre is a list of 1-based indices of '>' characters in s1, totalOne is the count of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of 1-based indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing two elements: 0 and n-1, ans is a list of n elements where the last element is calculated based on the last character of s1 and the count of '>' characters in s1, i is n - 2, el is the character at index n-2 in s1, zr is 1 if the last character of s1 is '<', otherwise it is 0, and ol is the count of '>' characters in s1. If zr is less than or equal to ol, then zeroInd is the sum of the last two elements of suffZero, oneInd is twice the result of func_1(preOne, zr), and ans[i] is the result of zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1. Otherwise, zeroInd is 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1), oneInd is 2 * preOne[-1], and ans[i] is zeroInd - oneInd.**
