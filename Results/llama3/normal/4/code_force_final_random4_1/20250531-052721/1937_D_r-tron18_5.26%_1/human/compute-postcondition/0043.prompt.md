Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: s1 is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer equal to the length of s1, pre is a list of 1-based indices of '>' characters in s1, totalOne is the count of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of 1-based indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing a single element 0, ans is a list of n zeros.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    el = s1[i]
    if el == '>':
        ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1
        if ol <= zr:
            zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)
            oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd
        else:
            zeroInd = 2 * suffZero[-1]
            oneInd = func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)
            oneInd -= func_1(preOne, 1)
            fi = func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi
        preOne.pop()
        totalOne -= 1
    else:
        suffZero.append(suffZero[-1] + i + 1)
        ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1
        if zr <= ol:
            zeroInd = suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]
            oneInd = 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1
        else:
            zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)
            oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1]
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *s1 is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer equal to the length of s1 and must be at least 1, pre is a list of 1-based indices of '>' characters in s1, totalOne is the count of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of 1-based indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing a single element 0 if the last character of s1 is '>', otherwise it contains two elements: 0 and n, ans is a list of n elements where the last element is calculated based on the last character of s1 and the count of '>' characters in s1, i is n - 1, el is either '<' or '>' depending on the character at index n-1 in s1, and zr is 0 if the last character of s1 is '>', otherwise it is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `s1` and must be at least 2, `pre` is a list of 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the count of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `suffZero` is a list containing a single element 0 if the last character of `s1` is '>', otherwise it contains two elements: 0 and `n`, `ans` is a list of `n` elements where the last element is calculated based on the last character of `s1` and the count of '>' characters in `s1`, `i` is `n - 2`, `el` is the character at index `n-2` in `s1`, and `zr` is 0 if the last character of `s1` is '>', otherwise it is 1. If `el` is '>', then `totalOne` is decreased by 1 and `preOne` has its last element removed. If `ol` is less than or equal to `zr`, then `ans[i]` is calculated as `zeroInd - oneInd`, where `zeroInd` is 2 * `func_1(suffZero, ol)` and `oneInd` is 2 * `preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`. Otherwise, `ans[i]` is calculated as `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`, where `zeroInd` is 2 * `suffZero[-1]`, `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)`, and `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`. If `el` is '<', then `suffZero` contains two elements: 0 and `n-1`. If `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, then `zeroInd` is the sum of the last two elements of `suffZero`, `oneInd` is twice the result of `func_1(preOne, zr)`, and `ans[i]` is the result of `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`. Otherwise, `zeroInd` is 2 * `func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`, `oneInd` is 2 * `preOne[-1]`, and `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *s1 is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer equal to the length of s1 and must be at least 3, pre is a list of 1-based indices of '>' characters in s1, totalOne is the count of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of 1-based indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing a single element 0 if the last character of s1 is '>', otherwise it contains two elements: 0 and n-1, ans is a list of n elements where the last element is calculated based on the last character of s1 and the count of '>' characters in s1, i is n - 3, el is the character at index n-3 in s1 which is either '<' or '>', and zr is 0 if the last character of s1 is '>', otherwise it is 1. If el is '>', then totalOne is decreased by 1, preOne is updated by removing the last element, and zr is set to 1 if the last character of s1 is '<', otherwise it is set to 0. If el is '<', then suffZero is updated to contain two elements: 0 and n-2, and if zr is less than or equal to the count of '>' characters in s1, then ans[i] is calculated as zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1, where zeroInd is n-2 and oneInd is 2 * func_1(preOne, zr). Otherwise, ans[i] is calculated as zeroInd - oneInd, where zeroInd is 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1) and oneInd is 2 * preOne[-1].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
