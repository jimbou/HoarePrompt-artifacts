Output State: **s1 is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer equal to the length of s1 and must be at least 2, pre is a list of 1-based indices of '>' characters in s1, totalOne is the count of '>' characters in s1 minus 1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of 1-based indices of '>' characters in s1 with the last element removed, suffZero is a list containing a single element 0 if the last character of s1 is '>', otherwise it contains two elements: 0 and n, ans is a list of n elements where the last element is calculated based on the last character of s1 and the count of '>' characters in s1, i is n - 2, el is the character at index n-2 in s1, ol is the count of '>' characters in s1 minus 1, and zr is 0 if the last character of s1 is '>', otherwise it is 1. If ol is less than or equal to zr, then ans[i] is calculated as zeroInd - oneInd, where zeroInd is 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol) and oneInd is 2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1). Otherwise, ans[i] is calculated as zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi, where zeroInd is 2 * suffZero[-1], oneInd is func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1), and fi is func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr).**

The code snippet modifies the values of `totalOne` and `preOne`. The first line removes the last element from `preOne`, which is a list of cumulative sums of 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`. The second line decrements `totalOne` by 1, which is the count of '>' characters in `s1`. These changes affect the calculation of `ans[i]`, which depends on the last character of `s1`, the count of '>' characters in `s1`, and the cumulative sums of 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
