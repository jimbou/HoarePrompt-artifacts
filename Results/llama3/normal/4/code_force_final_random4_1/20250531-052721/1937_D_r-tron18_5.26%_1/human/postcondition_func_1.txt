This function calculates and returns a list of values based on the input string s1, which consists of '<' and '>' characters. The function iterates through the string from right to left, maintaining a count of '>' characters and their cumulative indices. For each character, it calculates a value based on the count of '>' characters, the cumulative indices, and the position of the character in the string. The calculated values are stored in a list, which is then returned. The function does not modify the input string.
