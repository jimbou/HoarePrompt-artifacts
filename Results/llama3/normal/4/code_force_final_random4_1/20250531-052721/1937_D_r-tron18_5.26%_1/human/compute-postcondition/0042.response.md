Postcondition: ***s1 is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer equal to the length of s1 and must be at least 3, pre is a list of 1-based indices of '>' characters in s1, totalOne is the count of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of 1-based indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing a single element 0 if the last character of s1 is '>', otherwise it contains two elements: 0 and n-1, ans is a list of n elements where the last element is calculated based on the last character of s1 and the count of '>' characters in s1, i is n - 3, el is the character at index n-3 in s1 which is either '<' or '>', and zr is 0 if the last character of s1 is '>', otherwise it is 1. If el is '>', then totalOne is decreased by 1, preOne is updated by removing the last element, and zr is set to 1 if the last character of s1 is '<', otherwise it is set to 0. If el is '<', then suffZero is updated to contain two elements: 0 and n-2, and if zr is less than or equal to the count of '>' characters in s1, then ans[i] is calculated as zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1, where zeroInd is n-2 and oneInd is 2 * func_1(preOne, zr). Otherwise, ans[i] is calculated as zeroInd - oneInd, where zeroInd is 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1) and oneInd is 2 * preOne[-1].***
