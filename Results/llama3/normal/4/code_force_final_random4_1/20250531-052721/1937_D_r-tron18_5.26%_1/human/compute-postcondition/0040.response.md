Output State: **s1 is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer equal to the length of s1 and must be at least 3, pre is a list of 1-based indices of '>' characters in s1, totalOne is the count of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of 1-based indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing two elements: 0 and n-2, ans is a list of n elements where the last element is calculated based on the last character of s1 and the count of '>' characters in s1, i is n - 3, el is the character at index n-3 in s1 which is either '<' or '>', ol is the count of '>' characters in s1, and zr is 1 if the last character of s1 is '<', otherwise it is 0, zeroInd is 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1), oneInd is 2 * preOne[-1], ans[i] is zeroInd - oneInd.**

The code snippet calculates the values of `zeroInd` and `oneInd` based on the provided functions `func_1` and the values of `suffZero`, `preOne`, and `ol`. It then uses these values to update the `ans` list at index `i`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
