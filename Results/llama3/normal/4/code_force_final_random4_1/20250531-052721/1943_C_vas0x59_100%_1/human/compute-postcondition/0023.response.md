Postcondition: ***`u2vs` is a list of n lists where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u, `u` is an integer equal to the last input minus 1, `v` is an integer equal to the last input minus 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `d` is a dictionary, `previous` is a dictionary, `path_ba` is a list containing `b` and `n`, `n` is the value of `previous` at key `path_ba[-1]`. If `n` is -1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing.***
