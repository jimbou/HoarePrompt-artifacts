#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes no parameters and returns None. It reads an integer n and n-1 pairs of integers from standard input, constructs an undirected graph with n vertices and n-1 edges, and performs a breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest path between two vertices. Depending on the length of the path, it generates a list of operations (ops) by pairing the middle vertex (or two middle vertices if the path length is even) with integers from 0 to the path length. The function then prints the length of the ops list and each operation in the format "{vertex + 1} {integer}".
