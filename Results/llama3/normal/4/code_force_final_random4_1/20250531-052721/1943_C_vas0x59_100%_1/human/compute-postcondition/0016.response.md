Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of n lists where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u, `u` is an integer equal to the last input minus 1, `v` is an integer equal to the last input minus 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `d` is a dictionary, `previous` is a dictionary, `path_ba` is a list containing `b` and `n`, and `n` is equal to the value of `previous[b]`. If the value of `n` is -1, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to be equal to the value of `previous[b]`, which is also the last element of the list `path_ba`. The other variables remain unchanged. If the value of `n` is -1, the program will break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
