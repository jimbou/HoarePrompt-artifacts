Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, u2vs is a list of n lists where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u, u is an integer equal to the first input minus 1, v is an integer equal to the second input minus 1, _ is 1, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The list `u2vs` is updated to include the values `u` and `v` at their respective indices. The values of `u` and `v` are calculated by subtracting 1 from the first and second inputs, respectively. The value of `_` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The stdin is empty as it has been used to read the inputs.
