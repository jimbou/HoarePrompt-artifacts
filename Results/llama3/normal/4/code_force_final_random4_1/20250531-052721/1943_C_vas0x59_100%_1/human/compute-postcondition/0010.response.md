Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of n lists where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u, `u` is an integer equal to the last input minus 1, `v` is an integer equal to the last input minus 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `d` is a dictionary, `previous` is a dictionary, `path_ba` is a list containing `b`, `n` is the value of `previous[b]`**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to be the value of `previous[b]`, which is the value of the dictionary `previous` at key `b`. The other variables remain unchanged.
