Postcondition: ***`u2vs` is a list of n lists where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u, `u` is an integer equal to the last input minus 1, `v` is an integer equal to the last input minus 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `d` is a dictionary, `previous` is a dictionary, `path_ba` is a list containing `b` and all the values of `n` until `n` is -1, `n` is -1, `ops` is a list. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` contains tuples of the middle element of `path_ba` and all integers from 0 to `ci` (inclusive), where `ci` is half the length of `path_ba` and is at least 0, and `i` is equal to `ci`. If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` contains tuples of the elements at indices `ci1` and `ci2` in `path_ba` and all odd integers from 1 to the length of `path_ba` minus `ci1` (inclusive), where `ci1` is half the length of `path_ba` minus 1, `ci2` is half the length of `path_ba`, `c1` is the value at index `ci1` in `path_ba`, `c2` is the value at index `ci2` in `path_ba`, and `i` is the length of `path_ba` minus `ci1`.***
