Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of n lists where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u, `u` is an integer equal to the last input minus 1, `v` is an integer equal to the last input minus 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `d` is a dictionary, `previous` is a dictionary, `path_ba` is a list containing `b` and `n`, `n` is the value of `previous` at key `path_ba[-1]`**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to be the value of `previous` at key `path_ba[-1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `path_ba` still contains `b` and `n`, but the value of `n` is now the value retrieved from the `previous` dictionary.
