Output State: `u2vs` is a list of n lists where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u, `u` is an integer equal to the last input minus 1, `v` is an integer equal to the last input minus 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `d` is a dictionary, `previous` is a dictionary, `path_ba` is a list containing `b` and all the values of `n` until `n` is -1 and must have at least 1 element, `n` is -1, `ops` is a list containing tuples of the middle element of `path_ba` and all integers from 0 to `ci`, `ci` is an integer equal to half the length of `path_ba` and is at least 0, `c` is the middle element of `path_ba`, `i` is `ci`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that all variables not affected by the loop head and body remain unchanged. The loop head and body only affect the `ops` list and the `i` variable. The `ops` list now contains tuples of the middle element of `path_ba` and all integers from 0 to `ci`, and the `i` variable is now equal to `ci`.
