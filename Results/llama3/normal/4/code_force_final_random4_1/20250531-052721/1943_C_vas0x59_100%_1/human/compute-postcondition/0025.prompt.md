Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than 1, u2vs is a list of n lists where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u, u is an integer equal to the last input minus 1, v is an integer equal to the last input minus 1, a is an integer, b is an integer, d is a dictionary, previous is a dictionary, path_ba is a list containing b.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    n = previous[path_ba[-1]]
    if n == -1:
        break
    path_ba.append(n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `u2vs` is a list of n lists where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u, `u` is an integer equal to the last input minus 1, `v` is an integer equal to the last input minus 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `d` is a dictionary, `previous` is a dictionary, `path_ba` is a list containing `b` and `n`, and if the value of `n` is -1, which is also the value of `previous[b]`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `u2vs` is a list of n lists where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u, `u` is an integer equal to the last input minus 1, `v` is an integer equal to the last input minus 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `d` is a dictionary, `previous` is a dictionary, `path_ba` is a list containing `b` and `n`. If the value of `n` is -1, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `u2vs` is a list of n lists where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u, `u` is an integer equal to the last input minus 1, `v` is an integer equal to the last input minus 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `d` is a dictionary, `previous` is a dictionary, `path_ba` is a list containing `b` and `n` and `previous` at key `path_ba[-1]`, `n` is the value of `previous` at key `path_ba[-1]`. If `n` is -1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
