To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(n - 1):`. The objects involved are `_` and `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 0, and `n` is an integer greater than 1.

For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must remain greater than 1.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `_` is 1
* `n` is an integer greater than 1 (no change)

The other variables `u2vs`, `stdin` are not involved in the loop head, so their states remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `u2vs` is a list of n empty lists, `stdin` is empty, `_` is 1**
