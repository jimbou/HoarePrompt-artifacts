Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of n lists where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u, `u` is an integer equal to the last input minus 1, `v` is an integer equal to the last input minus 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `d` is a dictionary, `previous` is a dictionary, `path_ba` is a list containing `b` and all the values of `n` until `n` is -1 and must have at least 1 element, `n` is -1, `ops` is a list containing a tuple of the middle element of `path_ba` and 0 and a tuple of the middle element of `path_ba` and 1, `ci` is an integer equal to half the length of `path_ba` and is at least 0, `c` is the middle element of `path_ba`, `i` is 1**

The code appends a tuple of the middle element of `path_ba` (which is `c`) and `i` (which is 1) to the list `ops`. This means that `ops` now contains two tuples: one with the middle element of `path_ba` and 0, and another with the middle element of `path_ba` and 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
