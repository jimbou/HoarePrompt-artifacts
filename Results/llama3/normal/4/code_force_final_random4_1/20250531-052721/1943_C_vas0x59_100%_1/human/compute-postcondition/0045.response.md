Output State: **u2vs is a list of n lists where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u, u is an integer equal to the last input minus 1, v is an integer equal to the last input minus 1, a is an integer, b is an integer, d is a dictionary, previous is a dictionary, path_ba is a list containing b and all the values of n until n is -1 and has at least ci1 + 2 elements, n is -1, ops is a list containing (c1, 1), (c1, 3), (c2, 1), (c2, 3), (c1, 5), (c2, 5), (c1, 7), (c2, 7), (c1, 9), (c2, 9), ci2 is half the length of path_ba, ci1 is half the length of path_ba minus 1, c1 is the value at index ci1 in path_ba, c2 is the value at index ci2 in path_ba, and i is the length of path_ba minus ci1.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the variables in the loop head and body. The loop head and body only affect the values of `i` and `ops`. The value of `i` is now the length of `path_ba` minus `ci1`, and the value of `ops` is a list containing all the pairs of `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for all the iterations of the loop. The other variables in the precondition remain unchanged.
