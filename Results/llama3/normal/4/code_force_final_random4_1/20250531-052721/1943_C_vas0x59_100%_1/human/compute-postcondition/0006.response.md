Output State: **n is an integer greater than 2, u2vs is a list of n lists where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u, u is an integer equal to the first input minus 1, v is an integer equal to the second input minus 1, _ is 2, stdin contains no input.**

The code snippet first reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to u and v. Since stdin contains no input, the values of u and v are not modified. The code then decrements u and v by 1, making u equal to the first input minus 1 and v equal to the second input minus 1. The code then appends v to the list at index u in u2vs and appends u to the list at index v in u2vs. This modifies the list u2vs, adding v to the list at index u and u to the list at index v. The value of n remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The value of _ also remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code.
