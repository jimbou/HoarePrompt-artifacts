Output State: `u2vs` is a list of n lists where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u, `u` is an integer equal to the last input minus 1, `v` is an integer equal to the last input minus 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `d` is a dictionary, `previous` is a dictionary, `path_ba` is a list containing `b` and all the values of `n` until `n` is -1 and must have at least 1 element, `n` is -1, `ops` is a list containing a tuple of the middle element of `path_ba` and 0, a tuple of the middle element of `path_ba` and 1, a tuple of the middle element of `path_ba` and 2, ..., a tuple of the middle element of `path_ba` and ci, `ci` is an integer equal to half the length of `path_ba` and is at least 0, `c` is the middle element of `path_ba`, `i` is ci.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the `ops` list, which now contains tuples of the middle element of `path_ba` and all integers from 0 to `ci` (inclusive). The `i` variable is now equal to `ci`. All other variables remain unchanged.
