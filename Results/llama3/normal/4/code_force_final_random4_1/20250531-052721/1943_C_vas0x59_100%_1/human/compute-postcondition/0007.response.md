Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, u2vs is a list of n lists where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u, u is an integer equal to the last input minus 1, v is an integer equal to the last input minus 1, _ is n - 1, stdin contains no input.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of n remains unchanged, the list u2vs will contain n lists where each list at index u contains v and each list at index v contains u, the variable u will be equal to the first input minus 1 and the variable v will be equal to the second input minus 1, the variable _ will be equal to n - 1, and stdin will contain no input.
