Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of n lists where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u, `u` is an integer equal to the last input minus 1, `v` is an integer equal to the last input minus 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `d` is a dictionary, `previous` is a dictionary, `path_ba` is a list containing `b` and all the values of `n` until `n` is -1 and must have at least 1 element, `n` is -1, `ops` is a list containing a tuple of the middle element of `path_ba` and 0, `ci` is an integer equal to half the length of `path_ba` and is at least 0, `c` is the middle element of `path_ba`, `i` is 0**

In this output state, the list `ops` has been updated to include a tuple containing the middle element of `path_ba` and the value 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
