According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer, which ensures that the loop will execute. However, to make the state more specific, we can adjust `t` to be at least 1.

State: **`t` is at least 1**
