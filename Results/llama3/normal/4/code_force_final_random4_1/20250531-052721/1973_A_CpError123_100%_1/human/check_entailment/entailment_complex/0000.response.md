Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the scores of the three players `a`, `b`, and `c` and checks if the sum of the scores is odd. If it is, the program prints -1 and moves on to the next test case, which is correct because the sum of the scores must be even (each game contributes 2 points to the total sum).
3.  If the sum of the scores is even, the program calculates `x` as half the sum of the scores and `y` as the sum of the first two scores.
4.  The program then prints the minimum value between `x` and `y`. This is correct because the maximum number of draws that could have happened is limited by the total number of points (`x`) and the number of points that can be distributed among the first two players (`y`).
5.  The program correctly handles all test cases and does not return any value.

Correctness: **True**
