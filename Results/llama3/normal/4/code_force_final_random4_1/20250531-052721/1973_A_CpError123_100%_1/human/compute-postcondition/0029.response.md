Output State: **t is 0, a, b, and c are integers from the input, x is an integer equal to half the sum of a, b, and c, y is an integer equal to the sum of a and b, _ is t, and the minimum value between x and y is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the loop counter `_` has reached the value of `t`, which is the number of test cases. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` hold the values of the last test case. The variables `x` and `y` hold the values calculated from the last test case. The minimum value between `x` and `y` is printed as the output. The loop has finished executing, and the program has terminated.
