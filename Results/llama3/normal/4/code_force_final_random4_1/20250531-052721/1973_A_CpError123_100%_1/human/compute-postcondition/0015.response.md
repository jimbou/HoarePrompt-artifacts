Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers, `x` is an integer equal to the average of `a`, `b`, and `c`, `y` is an integer equal to the sum of `a` and `b`, stdin contains no input, the minimum value between the average of `a`, `b`, and `c` (`x`) and the sum of `a` and `b` (`y`) is being printed, `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned new values from the input, and -1 is being printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `x`, and `y` remain the same as they were not affected by the `continue` statement. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated with new values from the input, but their exact values are unknown. The minimum value between `x` and `y` is still being printed, and -1 is also being printed. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip to the next iteration of the loop, without executing any further code in the current iteration.
