Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers from the input, `x` is an integer equal to the average of the new values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, `y` is an integer equal to the sum of the new values of `a` and `b`, `_` is 1. If the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd, the program skips to the next iteration of the loop and prints -1. Otherwise, the program continues with the current values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `x`, `y`, and `_`.***
