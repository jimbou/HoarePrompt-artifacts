The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is not specified, `t` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 and `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is greater than 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers, `x` is an integer equal to the average of `a`, `b`, and `c`, `y` is an integer equal to the sum of `a` and `b`, `stdin` contains no input, `_` is 1**
