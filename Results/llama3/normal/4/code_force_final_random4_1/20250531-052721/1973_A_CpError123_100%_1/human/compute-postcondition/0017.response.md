Output State: **t is greater than 1, a, b, and c are integers, x is an integer equal to the average of a, b, and c, y is an integer equal to the sum of a and b, stdin contains no input, the minimum value between the average of a, b, and c (x) and the sum of a and b (y) is being printed, a, b, and c are assigned new values from the input. If the sum of a, b, and c is odd, -1 is being printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues to the next statement.**

In this output state, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` have been updated from the input, and `x` and `y` have been recalculated based on these new values. The minimum value between `x` and `y` is being printed, and if the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd, -1 is being printed and the loop skips to the next iteration. The value of `t` remains greater than 1.
