Output: **t is greater than 1, a, b, and c are integers, x is an integer equal to the average of a, b, and c, y is an integer equal to the sum of a and b, stdin contains no input, the minimum value between the average of a, b, and c (x) and the sum of a and b (y) is being printed, a, b, and c are assigned new values from the input. If the sum of a, b, and c is odd, -1 is being printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues to the next statement, and the minimum value between the average of a, b, and c (x) and the sum of a and b (y) is printed**
