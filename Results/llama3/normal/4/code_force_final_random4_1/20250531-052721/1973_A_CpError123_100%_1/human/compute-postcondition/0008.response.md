Output State: **t is at least 1, a, b, and c are integers, x is an integer equal to the average of a, b, and c, y is an integer equal to the sum of a and b, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` also remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The variable `x` is assigned the average of `a`, `b`, and `c`, which is calculated by dividing their sum by 2. The variable `y` is assigned the sum of `a` and `b`. Stdin is empty as no input is read or processed by the code.
