Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when the input is 1 1 10, the program outputs 2, but the correct output should be -1. This is because it is not possible to achieve the scores 1 1 10 with any valid set of games and results.

In this case, the program does not correctly handle the situation where the total number of points is not evenly distributed among the players. The program only checks if the total number of points is even, but it does not check if the points can be distributed in a way that is consistent with the rules of the game.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and the Correctness is **False**.
