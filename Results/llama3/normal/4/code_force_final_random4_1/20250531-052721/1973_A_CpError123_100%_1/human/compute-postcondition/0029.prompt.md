Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three integers p_1, p_2 and p_3 (0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30) â€” the scores of the three players, sorted non-decreasingly.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
    if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:
        print(-1)
        continue
    x = (a + b + c) // 2
    y = a + b
    print(min(x, y))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is at least 1, a, b, and c are integers, x is an integer equal to the average of a, b, and c, y is an integer equal to the sum of a and b, stdin contains no input, and the minimum value between the average of a, b, and c (x) and the sum of a and b (y) is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is greater than 1, a, b, and c are integers, x is an integer equal to the average of a, b, and c, y is an integer equal to the sum of a and b, stdin contains no input, the minimum value between the average of a, b, and c (x) and the sum of a and b (y) is being printed, a, b, and c are assigned new values from the input. If the sum of a, b, and c is odd, -1 is being printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues to the next statement, and the minimum value between the average of a, b, and c (x) and the sum of a and b (y) is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is greater than 1, a, b, and c are integers from the input, x is an integer equal to half the sum of a, b, and c, y is an integer equal to the sum of a and b, _ is 1, and the minimum value between x and y is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
