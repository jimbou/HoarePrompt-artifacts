Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers from the input, `x` is an integer equal to the average of the new values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, `y` is an integer equal to the sum of the new values of `a` and `b`, `_` is 1, and the program skips to the next iteration of the loop and -1 is being printed**

The continue statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `x`, `y`, and `_` remain unchanged. The program is still waiting for user input, and -1 is still being printed.
