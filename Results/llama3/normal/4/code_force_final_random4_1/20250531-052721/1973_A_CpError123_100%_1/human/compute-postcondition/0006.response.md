The code `continue` skips the rest of the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration of the loop. Since we are not given any information about the loop, we can't determine what the next iteration will be. However, we can say that the values of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not affected by the `continue` statement.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers, the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd, stdin contains one input: a space-separated list of integers, and we move on to the next iteration of the loop.**
