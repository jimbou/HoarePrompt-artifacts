Output State: **t is greater than 1, a, b, and c are integers from the input, x is an integer equal to half the sum of a, b, and c, y is an integer equal to the sum of a and b, _ is 1. If the sum of a, b, and c is odd, the program skips to the next iteration of the loop and prints -1. Otherwise, the program continues with the current values of a, b, c, x, y, and _.**

The first line of the code reassigns the value of `x` to be half the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c`. This means that `x` is now equal to the average of the new values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. The second line reassigns the value of `y` to be the sum of `a` and `b`. This means that `y` is now equal to the sum of the new values of `a` and `b`. The values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `t`, and `_` remain unchanged.
