This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers representing the scores of three players. It calculates the minimum value between half the sum of the scores and the sum of the first two scores, and prints this value. If the sum of the scores is odd, it prints -1 instead. The function processes all test cases and does not return any value.
