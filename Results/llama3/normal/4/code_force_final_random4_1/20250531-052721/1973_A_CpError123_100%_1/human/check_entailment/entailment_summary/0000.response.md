Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly handles the case where the sum of the scores is odd. In such cases, it's impossible to achieve the given scores through any combination of wins, losses, and draws, so the program correctly prints -1.

2.  The program calculates the maximum possible number of draws by finding the minimum value between half the sum of the scores (x) and the sum of the first two scores (y). This is because the maximum number of draws can't exceed half the total points earned (since each draw awards 1 point to each player) or the total points earned by the first two players (since they can't earn more points than they have).

3.  The program processes all test cases and does not return any value, which is consistent with the problem description.

4.  The program assumes valid inputs as described in the problem description, which is a reasonable assumption.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
