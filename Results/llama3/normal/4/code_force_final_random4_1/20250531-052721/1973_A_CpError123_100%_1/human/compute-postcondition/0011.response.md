The only variable in the loop head is variable `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is greater than 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers, `x` is an integer equal to the average of `a`, `b`, and `c`, `y` is an integer equal to the sum of `a` and `b`, stdin contains no input, and the minimum value between the average of `a`, `b`, and `c` (`x`) and the sum of `a` and `b` (`y`) is being printed**
