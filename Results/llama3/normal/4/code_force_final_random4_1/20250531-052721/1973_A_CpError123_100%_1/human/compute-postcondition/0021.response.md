The code snippet `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` assigns the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` to the integers from the input, where `input().split()` accepts a space-separated list of integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. However, the initial state specifies that `stdin` contains no input. This means that the program will wait for user input to assign values to `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Since the initial state specifies that `x` is an integer equal to the average of `a`, `b`, and `c`, and `y` is an integer equal to the sum of `a` and `b`, the values of `x` and `y` will change once `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned new values.

The value of `t` is greater than 1, and the value of `_` is 1, but these variables are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers from the input, `x` is an integer equal to the average of the new values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, `y` is an integer equal to the sum of the new values of `a` and `b`, `_` is 1, and the program is waiting for user input.**
