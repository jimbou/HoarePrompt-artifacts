Reasoning:

The program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the scores of the three players `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3.  It checks if the sum of the scores is odd. If it is, the program prints -1 and continues to the next test case. This is because the sum of the scores must be even, as each game contributes either 2 or 0 points to the total sum.
4.  If the sum of the scores is even, the program calculates `x` as half the sum of the scores. This represents the maximum possible number of draws, as each draw contributes 1 point to the total sum.
5.  The program then calculates `y` as the sum of the scores of the first two players `a` and `b`. This represents the maximum possible number of points that the first two players could have scored.
6.  Finally, the program prints the minimum of `x` and `y`. This is because the maximum possible number of draws cannot exceed the maximum possible number of points that the first two players could have scored.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the maximum possible number of draws for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
