Postcondition: ***`q` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `mn` is 100, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers between 0 and 9, `i` is 0, stdin contains `q-1` lines, each containing three digits (0 <= a, b, c <= 9). The current values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are such that `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`.***
