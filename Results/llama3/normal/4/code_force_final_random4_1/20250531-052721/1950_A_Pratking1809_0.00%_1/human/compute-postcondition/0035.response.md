Functionality: **The function reads a series of lines from standard input, where the first line contains an integer (t) and each subsequent line contains three digits (a, b, c). It then classifies each set of three digits into one of three categories: 'STAIR' if a < b < c, 'PEAK' if a < b > c or a < b == c, and 'NONE' otherwise. The function prints the classification for each set of three digits.**
