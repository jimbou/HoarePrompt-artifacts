Output State: **`q` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `mn` is 100, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers between 0 and 9, `i` is 1, stdin contains `q-3` lines, each containing three digits (0 <= a, b, c <= 9). If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`, 'PEAK' is printed. Otherwise, 'NONE' is printed.**

In this output state, the values of `q`, `mn`, and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to the three integers read from the first line of the input, which contains three digits between 0 and 9. The stdin now contains `q-3` lines, each containing three digits. The condition for printing 'PEAK' or 'NONE' is still valid, but it will be evaluated based on the new values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.
