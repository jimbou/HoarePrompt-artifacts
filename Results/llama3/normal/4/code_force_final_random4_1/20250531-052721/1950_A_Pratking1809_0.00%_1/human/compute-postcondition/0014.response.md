To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `q`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `q` is an integer between 1 and 1000. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `q` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`q` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `mn` is 100, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers between 0 and 9, `i` is 1, stdin contains `q-2` lines, each containing three digits (0 <= a, b, c <= 9). If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`, 'PEAK' is printed. Otherwise, 'NONE' is printed.**
