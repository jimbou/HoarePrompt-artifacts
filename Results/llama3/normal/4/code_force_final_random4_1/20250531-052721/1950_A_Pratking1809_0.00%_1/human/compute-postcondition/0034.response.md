Output State: **`q` is an integer between 0 and 1000, `mn` is 100, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers between 0 and 9 that were read from the last line of stdin, `i` is `q-1`, stdin is empty. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, 'STAIR' is printed. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`, 'PEAK' is printed. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is equal to `c`, 'PEAK' is printed. Otherwise, 'NONE' is printed.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all `q` iterations, and the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are the last set of values read from the input. The loop counter `i` has reached `q-1`, and the input stream is empty. The output is determined by the conditions in the loop body, which check the relationships between `a`, `b`, and `c` and print 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' accordingly.
