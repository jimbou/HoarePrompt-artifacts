Reasoning:

The given program is almost correct, but it has a small issue. The problem statement defines a peak as a<b>c, but the program also considers a<b==c as a peak, which is not according to the problem statement. This is because the condition `a < b > c` is not exclusive to the condition `a < b == c`. 

However, the execution summary does not show any case where a<b==c, so the program's output matches the expected output for the given test cases. But, if a test case like (1, 2, 2) is provided, the program will incorrectly classify it as a 'PEAK' instead of 'NONE'.

Correctness: **False**
