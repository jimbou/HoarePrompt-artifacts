Output: **`q` is an integer between 3 and 1000, `mn` is 100, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers between 0 and 9 that were read from the first line of stdin, `i` is 2, stdin contains `q-4` lines, each containing three digits (0 <= a, b, c <= 9). If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`, 'PEAK' is printed. Otherwise, 'NONE' is printed. Additionally, if `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, 'STAIR' is printed. If `a` is not less than `b` or `b` is not greater than `c`, 'NONE' is printed, and 'STAIR' is printed**
