According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `q`. If `q` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `q` is an integer between 1 and 1000, which ensures that the loop will execute. However, we need to adjust the state of `i` to be 0, since it will be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`q` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `mn` is 100, `stdin` contains `q` lines, each containing three digits (0 <= a, b, c <= 9), `i` is 0**
