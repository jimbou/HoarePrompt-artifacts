Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input is "3 2 1". According to the problem description, this should output "NONE" because it does not satisfy the condition of a stair or a peak. However, the program outputs nothing because the conditions for "STAIR" and "PEAK" are not met, but it does not explicitly handle this case.

The issue is with the if-else statement. The program checks if the numbers form a stair, and if not, it checks if they form a peak. However, if neither condition is met, it does not print anything. To fix this, the program should have an else statement that prints "NONE" when neither condition is met.

Here is the corrected code:

```
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

In this corrected version, the elif statement checks if the numbers form a peak only if they do not form a stair. If neither condition is met, the else statement prints "NONE".
