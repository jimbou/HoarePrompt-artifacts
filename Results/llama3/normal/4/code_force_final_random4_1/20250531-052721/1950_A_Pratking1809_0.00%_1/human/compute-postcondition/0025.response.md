Output State: **`q` is an integer between 3 and 1000, `mn` is 100, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers between 0 and 9 that were read from the first line of stdin, `i` is 2, stdin contains `q-4` lines, each containing three digits (0 <= a, b, c <= 9). If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`, 'PEAK' is printed. Otherwise, 'NONE' is printed. Additionally, if `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, 'STAIR' is printed. If `a` is not less than `b` or `b` is not greater than `c`, 'NONE' is printed.**

In this output state, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` have been updated to the integers read from the first line of stdin. The number of lines in stdin has decreased by 1. The other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
