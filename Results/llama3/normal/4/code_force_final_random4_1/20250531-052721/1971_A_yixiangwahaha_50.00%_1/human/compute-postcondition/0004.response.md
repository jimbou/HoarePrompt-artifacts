Output State: **x is a list containing two integers, y is a list containing two integers, i is 1, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of two integers**

The code block reads a space-separated list of two integers from stdin and appends them to the lists x and y, respectively. Since x and y initially contain one integer each, they will now contain two integers each. The variable i remains unchanged at 1. Stdin, which initially contained 0 inputs, now contains 1 input: a space-separated list of two integers.
