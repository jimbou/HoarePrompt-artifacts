Postcondition: **`x` and `y` are lists containing ten integers, `i` is 1, `10` is greater than 1, and stdin is empty. If the 2nd element of the list `x` is less than the 2nd element of the list `y`, then the 2nd element of the list `x` and the 2nd element of the list `y` are printed. Otherwise, the 2nd element of the list `y` and the 2nd element of the list `x` are printed.**
