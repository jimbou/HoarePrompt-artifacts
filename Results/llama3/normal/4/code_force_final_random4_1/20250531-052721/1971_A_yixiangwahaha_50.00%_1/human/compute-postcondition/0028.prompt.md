Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: x is a list containing ten integers, y is a list containing ten integers, i is 9, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for i in range(10):
    if x[i] < y[i]:
        print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
    else:
        print(y[i], ' ', x[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `x` and `y` are lists containing ten integers, `i` is 0, `10` is greater than 0, and stdin is empty. The first elements of `x` and `y` are compared, and the smaller value is printed first, followed by the larger value.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `x` and `y` are lists containing ten integers, `i` is 1, `10` is greater than 1, and stdin is empty. If the 2nd element of the list `x` is less than the 2nd element of the list `y`, then the 2nd element of the list `x` and the 2nd element of the list `y` are printed. Otherwise, the 2nd element of the list `y` and the 2nd element of the list `x` are printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`x` and `y` are lists containing ten integers, `i` is 2, `10` is greater than 2, and stdin is empty. If the 3rd element of `x` is less than the 3rd element of `y`, the 3rd element of `x` and the 3rd element of `y` are printed. Otherwise, the 3rd element of `y` and the 3rd element of `x` are printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
