Postcondition: ***`x` and `y` are lists containing ten integers, `i` is 2, `10` is greater than 2, and stdin is empty. If the 3rd element of `x` is less than the 3rd element of `y`, the 3rd element of `x` and the 3rd element of `y` are printed. Otherwise, the 3rd element of `y` and the 3rd element of `x` are printed.***
