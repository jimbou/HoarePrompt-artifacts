The code prints the element at index `i` of the list `x`, which is the 3rd element of the list `x`, and the element at index `i` of the list `y`, which is the 3rd element of the list `y`. Since the exact values of the elements in the lists `x` and `y` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of `x[i]` and `y[i]`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the 3rd elements of the lists `x` and `y`.

Output: **the 3rd element of the list x, the 3rd element of the list y**
