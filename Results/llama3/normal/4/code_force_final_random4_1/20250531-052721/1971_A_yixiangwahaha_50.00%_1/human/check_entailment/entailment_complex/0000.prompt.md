Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) â€” the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 100) and then t lines each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9).
    t = input()
    x = []
    y = []
    for i in range(10):
        xylist = input().split(' ')
        
        x.append(int(xylist[0]))
        
        y.append(int(xylist[1]))
        
    #State: x is a list containing ten integers, y is a list containing ten integers, i is 9, stdin is empty
    for i in range(10):
        if x[i] < y[i]:
            print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
        else:
            print(y[i], ' ', x[i])
        
    #State: `x` and `y` are lists containing ten integers, `i` is 10, `10` is not greater than 10, and stdin is empty. The first ten elements of `x` and `y` are compared, and the smaller value is printed first, followed by the larger value.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from stdin, expecting an integer t (1 <= t <= 100) followed by t lines of two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9). It then compares each pair of x and y values, printing the smaller value first, followed by the larger value. The function does not return any value but prints the results directly to the console.
