Output: **`x` is a list containing ten integers, `y` is a list containing ten integers, `i` is 0, `10` is greater than 0, stdin is empty. The current value of `x[i]` is less than the current value of `y[i]`, and this is printed: the value of `x[i]` which is the first element of the list `x` and the value of `y[i]` which is the first element of the list `y`**
