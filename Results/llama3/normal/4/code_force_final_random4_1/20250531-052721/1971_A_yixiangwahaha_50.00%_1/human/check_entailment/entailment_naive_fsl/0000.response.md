Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The problem description states that the input will contain a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases, but the program assumes that the number of test cases is always 10. If the number of test cases is less than 10, the program will throw an error when trying to access the 10th element of the x and y lists. 

For example, if the input is:

3
1 9
8 4
1 4

The program will throw an error when trying to access the 10th element of the x and y lists, because they only have 3 elements. 

To fix this, the program should use the value of t to determine the number of test cases, rather than hardcoding it to 10.
