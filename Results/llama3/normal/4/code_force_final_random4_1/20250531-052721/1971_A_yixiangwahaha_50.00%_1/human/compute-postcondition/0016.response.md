The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the number `10`. If `i` is less than `10`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `0`, and `10` is greater than `0`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by `1`, so `i` is `1`, and `10` is still greater than `1`.

State: **`x` and `y` are lists containing ten integers, `i` is 1, `10` is greater than 1, and stdin is empty.**
