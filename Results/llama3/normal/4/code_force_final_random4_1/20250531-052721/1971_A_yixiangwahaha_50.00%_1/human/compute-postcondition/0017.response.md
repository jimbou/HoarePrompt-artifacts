The code prints the element at index `i` of the list `x`, which is the second element of the list `x`, and the element at index `i` of the list `y`, which is the second element of the list `y`. The value of `i` is 1, and the lists `x` and `y` contain ten integers.
Output: **the second element of the list x, the second element of the list y**
