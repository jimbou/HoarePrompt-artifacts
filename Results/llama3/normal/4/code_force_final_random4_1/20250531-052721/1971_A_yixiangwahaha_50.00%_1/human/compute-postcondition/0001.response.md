The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 10, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is not defined, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 0. 

State: **stdin contains 1 input: t lines each containing two space-separated integers x and y, t is a string, x is an empty list, y is an empty list, i is 0**
