Based on the precondition, we can analyze the code as follows:

* `x` and `y` are lists containing ten integers.
* `i` is 1.
* The print statement is `print(y[i], ' ', x[i])`.

Since `i` is 1, we need to access the elements at index 1 in both lists `x` and `y`. In Python, list indices start at 0, so the element at index 1 is actually the second element in each list.

Let's denote the second element of list `x` as `x[1]` and the second element of list `y` as `y[1]`.

The print statement will print the value of `y[1]`, followed by a space, and then the value of `x[1]`.

Since the exact values of `x[1]` and `y[1]` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the values of the second elements of lists `x` and `y`.

Output: **y[1] (the second element of list y), x[1] (the second element of list x)**
