Based on the initial state, we can analyze the print statement as follows:

`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, and `n` is the length of `s`. The variable `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is not equal to the first character of `s`, and `x` is not equal to -1. This means that the string `s` has at least two distinct characters.

The function `func_1(s[0:])` returns True, which means that the entire string `s` satisfies some condition (not specified in the problem). However, the function `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns False, which means that the substring of `s` starting from index `x + 1` does not satisfy the same condition.

The print statement `print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])` prints two parts of the string `s`:

1. `s[:x + 1]`: This is the substring of `s` from the beginning to index `x` (inclusive). Since `x` is the index of the first character that is not equal to the first character of `s`, this substring consists of the first character of `s` repeated `x + 1` times.
2. `s[x + 1:]`: This is the substring of `s` starting from index `x + 1` to the end of the string. This substring does not satisfy the condition checked by `func_1`.

The output will be the concatenation of these two substrings, separated by a space.

Output: **[first character of s] repeated (x + 1) times, followed by a space, followed by the substring of s starting from index x + 1**
