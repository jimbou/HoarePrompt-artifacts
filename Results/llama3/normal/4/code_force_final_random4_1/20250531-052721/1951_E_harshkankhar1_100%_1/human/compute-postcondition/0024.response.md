Output State: **The program returns nothing, as there is no explicit return statement. The value of x remains -1, indicating that there is no character in s that is not equal to the first character of s, and 'NO' is still being printed. The function func_1(s[0:]) remains True, and the length of s, denoted by n, remains unchanged.**
