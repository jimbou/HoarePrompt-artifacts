Output State: **s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, n is greater than 3, the function func_1(s[0:]) returns True, x is 3, i is 3.**

The code assigns the value of `i` to `x`, making `x` equal to 3. The `break` statement does not affect any variables. No other variables are affected. The value of `s` remains unchanged, and the function `func_1(s[0:])` still returns True. The value of `n` remains greater than 3.
