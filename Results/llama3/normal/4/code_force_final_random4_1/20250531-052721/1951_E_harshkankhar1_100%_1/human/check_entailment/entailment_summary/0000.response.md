Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem of partitioning a string into substrings such that each substring is not a palindrome. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. 

`func_1` checks if a given string is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse. This function is used as a helper function in `func_2`.

`func_2` is the main function that takes a string `s` as input and performs the following actions:

1. It first checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome. If it's not a palindrome, it prints "YES", 1, and the string itself, indicating that the string can be partitioned into one substring that is not a palindrome.

2. If the entire string `s` is a palindrome, it then checks for the first character that is different from the first character of the string. If no such character is found, it prints "NO", indicating that the string cannot be partitioned into substrings that are not palindromes.

3. If a different character is found, it then checks if the substring from that character to the end of the string is not a palindrome. If it's not a palindrome, it prints "YES", 2, and the partitioned substrings, indicating that the string can be partitioned into two substrings that are not palindromes.

4. If the substring from the different character to the end of the string is a palindrome, it then checks if the different character is at the second position or at the middle of the string. If it's at either of these positions, it prints "NO", indicating that the string cannot be partitioned into substrings that are not palindromes.

5. If the different character is not at the second position or at the middle of the string, it prints "YES", 2, and the partitioned substrings, indicating that the string can be partitioned into two substrings that are not palindromes.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and provides the correct output for each case. Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
