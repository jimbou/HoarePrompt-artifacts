Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input string is "abba", the program will print "NO" because it checks if the substring from the second character to the end is a palindrome, which it is. However, the correct output should be "YES" because the string can be partitioned into two non-palindromic substrings: "ab" and "ba".

The program's logic is flawed because it only checks if the substring from the second character to the end is a palindrome, and if it is, it assumes that the entire string cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. However, this is not always the case, as shown by the example above.

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to check all possible partitions of the string, not just the one starting from the second character.
