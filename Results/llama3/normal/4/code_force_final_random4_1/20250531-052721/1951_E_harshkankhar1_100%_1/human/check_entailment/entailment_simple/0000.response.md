Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine if a given string can be partitioned into substrings such that each substring is not a palindrome. The program uses a helper function `func_1` to check if a string is a palindrome.

The program first checks if the entire string is not a palindrome. If it is not, it prints "YES", 1, and the string itself, as the string is already a valid partition.

If the entire string is a palindrome, the program then checks for the first character that is not equal to the first character of the string. If no such character exists, it means that the string consists of the same character repeated, and it is not possible to partition it into non-palindromic substrings. In this case, the program prints "NO".

If a character not equal to the first character is found, the program then checks if the substring starting from that character is not a palindrome. If it is not, it prints "YES", 2, and the string split into two substrings at that character.

If the substring starting from the character is a palindrome, the program then checks if the index of that character is 1 or half of the length of the string. If it is, it means that the string cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings, and the program prints "NO".

Otherwise, the program prints "YES", 2, and the string split into two substrings at the index of the character plus 1.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct output for each case.

Correctness: **True**
