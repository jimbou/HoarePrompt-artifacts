Based on the precondition, the code will print the number 2.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

* The precondition states that `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is not equal to the first character of `s`, and `x` is not equal to -1. This means that `s` contains at least two different characters.
* The precondition also states that the function `func_1(s[0:])` returns True. This means that the function `func_1` is applied to the entire string `s` and returns True.
* The precondition also states that the current value of `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is False. This means that the function `func_1` is applied to the substring of `s` starting from the character at index `x + 1` and returns False.
* The print statement simply prints the number 2.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is simply the number 2, without any relation to the values of `s`, `n`, `x`, or the function `func_1`.

Output: **2**
