Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of partitioning a string into substrings such that each substring is not a palindrome. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` checks if a given string is a palindrome, and `func_2` attempts to partition the input string into non-palindromic substrings.

Upon analyzing the program, it appears to correctly implement the logic for solving the problem. The `func_2` function first checks if the entire input string is not a palindrome, in which case it can be printed as is. If the string is a palindrome, it then searches for the first character that is not equal to the first character of the string. If no such character is found, it prints "NO" as there is no valid partition. Otherwise, it checks if the substring starting from the found character is not a palindrome. If it is not, it prints "YES" along with the partition. If the substring is a palindrome, it further checks if the index of the found character is 1 or half of the length of the string. If either condition is true, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES" along with a partition that includes the first `x+2` characters and the rest of the string.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the expected output for each test case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
