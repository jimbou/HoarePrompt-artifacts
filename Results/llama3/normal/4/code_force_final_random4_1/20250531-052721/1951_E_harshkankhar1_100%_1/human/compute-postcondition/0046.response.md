Functionality: **This function takes a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin characters as input and performs the following actions:**

*   **Checks if the string `s` meets a certain condition defined by the function `func_1(s[0:])`. If the condition is not met, it prints 'YES', 1, and the string `s`, and then returns without any further actions.**
*   **If the condition is met, it searches for the first character in `s` that is not equal to the first character of `s`. If no such character is found, it prints 'NO' and returns.**
*   **If a different character is found, it checks another condition defined by the function `func_1(s[x + 1:])`. If this condition is not met, it prints 'YES', 2, and splits the string `s` into two substrings at the index `x + 1`, printing both substrings.**
*   **If the condition is met, it checks if the index `x` is either 1 or half of the length of `s`. If either condition is true, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES', 2, and splits the string `s` into two substrings at the index `x + 2`, printing both substrings.**
