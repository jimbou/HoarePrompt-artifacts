To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 2, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to but does not include `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1, and `i` must be 1 at the start of the loop.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is -1, `i` is 1, and the function func_1(s[0:]) returns True**
