The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `n` is greater than 2, the function func_1(s[0:]) returns True. If the current value of `s[i]` is not equal to the first character of `s`, then `x` is 1 and `i` is 2. Otherwise, no changes are made to `x` and `i`.**
