Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `n` is the length of `s`, `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is not equal to the first character of `s`, and `x` is not equal to -1, the function func_1(s[0:]) returns True, and the function func_1(s[x + 1:]) returns True. If `x` is either 1 or half of the length of `s`, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, and the first `x+2` characters of the string `s` and the rest of the string `s` are printed.***
