You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
    s = input()
    n, x = len(s), -1
    if (func_1(s[0:]) == False) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(1)

        print(s)
        #This is printed: the string s (which is a sequence of lowercase Latin characters)
        return
        #The program returns nothing, 'YES' has been printed, 1 has been printed, and the string s has been printed, and the function func_1(s[0:]) is still False, and the variable x is still -1, and the variable n is still the length of the string s, and the string s is still consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
    #State: *s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, n is the length of s, x is -1, and the function func_1(s[0:]) returns True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[0]:

    #State: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `n` is the length of `s`, `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is not equal to the first character of `s`, or -1 if no such character exists, and the function func_1(s[0:]) returns True.
    if (x == -1) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
        return
        #The program returns nothing, as there is no explicit return statement. The value of x remains -1, indicating that there is no character in s that is not equal to the first character of s, and 'NO' is still being printed. The function func_1(s[0:]) remains True, and the length of s, denoted by n, remains unchanged.
    #State: *`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `n` is the length of `s`, `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is not equal to the first character of `s`, and `x` is not equal to -1, and the function func_1(s[0:]) returns True.
    if (func_1(s[x + 1:]) == False) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
        print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])
        #This is printed: [first character of s] repeated (x + 1) times, followed by a space, followed by the substring of s starting from index x + 1
    else :

If `x` is either 1 or half of the length of `s`, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, and the first `x+2` characters of the string `s` and the rest of the string `s` are printed.
    #State: *`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `n` is the length of `s`, `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is not equal to the first character of `s`, and `x` is not equal to -1, and the function func_1(s[0:]) returns True. If func_1(s[x + 1:]) is False, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, and the string `s` is split into two substrings at index `x + 1` and both substrings are being printed. If func_1(s[x + 1:]) is True, if `x` is either 1 or half of the length of `s`, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, and the first `x+2` characters of the string `s` and the rest of the string `s` are printed.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns nothing, 'YES' has been printed, 1 has been printed, and the string s has been printed, and the function func_1(s[0:]) is still False, and the variable x is still -1, and the variable n is still the length of the string s, and the string s is still consisting of lowercase Latin characters.

Case_2: The program returns nothing, as there is no explicit return statement. The value of x remains -1, indicating that there is no character in s that is not equal to the first character of s, and 'NO' is still being printed. The function func_1(s[0:]) remains True, and the length of s, denoted by n, remains unchanged.

Case_3: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `n` is the length of `s`, `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is not equal to the first character of `s`, and `x` is not equal to -1, and the function func_1(s[0:]) returns True. The current value of func_1(s[x + 1:]) is False, and 'YES' is being printed, and the number 2 is being printed, and the string `s` is being split into two substrings at index `x + 1` and both substrings are being printed

Case_4: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `n` is the length of `s`, `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is not equal to the first character of `s`, and `x` is not equal to -1, the function func_1(s[0:]) returns True, and the function func_1(s[x + 1:]) returns True. Additionally, `x` is neither 1 nor equal to half of `n`, 'YES' is being printed, and the number 2 is being printed, and this is printed: the first x+2 characters of the string s and the rest of the string s


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
