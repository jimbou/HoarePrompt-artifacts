Output State: **a is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 100, i is 2, b is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, c is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, q is a tuple containing b and c, stdin contains t-4 lines, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100).**

The code reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to b and c, respectively. It then creates a tuple q containing the values of b and c. The values of a and i remain unchanged. The code does not modify the contents of stdin, but since two lines have been read, the number of remaining lines in stdin is reduced by 2.
