Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to build a tower with m cubes after n moves. The program checks the following conditions:

1. If b (the number of moves) is equal to c (the number of cubes), it prints 'YES' because Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower b times in a row.
2. If b is less than c, it prints 'NO' because Nikita cannot build a tower with more cubes than the number of moves.
3. If b and c have the same parity (i.e., both are even or both are odd), it prints 'Yes' because Nikita can build a tower with m cubes by putting 1 cube on top of the tower b times, with some moves being "undo" moves (removing a cube from the top of the tower).
4. If b and c have different parity, it prints 'No' because Nikita cannot build a tower with m cubes in this case.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
