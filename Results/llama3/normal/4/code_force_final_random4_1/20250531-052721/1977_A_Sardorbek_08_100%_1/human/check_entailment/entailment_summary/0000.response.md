Reasoning:

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. The problem states that Nikita can either put exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or remove exactly 1 cube from the top of the tower in one move. This means that the number of cubes in the tower can only change by 1 in each move.

The program checks the following conditions:

1. If the number of moves (b) is equal to the number of cubes (c), it prints 'YES' because Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower b times in a row.

2. If the number of moves (b) is less than the number of cubes (c), it prints 'NO' because Nikita cannot put more cubes than the number of moves.

3. If the number of moves (b) and the number of cubes (c) have the same parity (i.e., both are even or both are odd), it prints 'Yes' because Nikita can end up with c cubes after b moves.

4. Otherwise, it prints 'No' because Nikita cannot end up with c cubes after b moves.

The execution summary confirms that the program processes all test cases and prints the corresponding results based on the conditions checked.

Correctness: **True**
