Reasoning:

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to build a tower with m cubes after n moves. The key insight is that the number of cubes in the tower can only change by 1 in each move, so the parity of the number of cubes (i.e., whether it's even or odd) can only change in each move. Therefore, if the number of moves (n) and the desired number of cubes (m) have the same parity, it's possible to build the tower.

The program correctly checks for the following cases:

* If n is equal to m, it's possible to build the tower by simply adding one cube at a time.
* If n is less than m, it's not possible to build the tower because there aren't enough moves to add the required number of cubes.
* If n and m have the same parity, it's possible to build the tower by adding or removing cubes in each move to reach the desired number of cubes.

The program correctly prints "YES" or "No" based on these conditions.

Correctness: **True**
