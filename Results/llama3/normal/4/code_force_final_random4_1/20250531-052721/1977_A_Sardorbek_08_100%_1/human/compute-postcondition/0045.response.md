Postcondition: ***a is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 100, i is 2, b is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, c is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, q is a tuple containing b and c, stdin contains t-4 lines, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100). If b equals c, 'YES' is printed. If b is less than c, 'NO' is printed. If b and c have the same parity (i.e., both are even or both are odd), then 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.***
