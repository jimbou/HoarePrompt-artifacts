Output State: **a is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 100, i is a-1, b is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, c is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, q is a tuple containing b and c, stdin is empty. If b is equal to c, 'YES' is printed. If b is not equal to c, then if b is less than c, 'NO' is printed. If b and c have the same parity, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: The loop has finished executing, and the value of 'a' is now between 0 and 100 (inclusive). The variable 'i' has reached its final value, which is one less than the initial value of 'a'. The variables 'b' and 'c' still hold integer values between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and the tuple 'q' contains these values. The standard input (stdin) is now empty, as all lines have been processed. The output will be 'YES' if 'b' equals 'c', 'NO' if 'b' is less than 'c', 'Yes' if 'b' and 'c' have the same parity, and 'No' otherwise.
