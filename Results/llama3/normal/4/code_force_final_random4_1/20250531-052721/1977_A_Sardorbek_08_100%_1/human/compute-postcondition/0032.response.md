Postcondition: ***a is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 100, i is 1, b is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, c is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, q is a tuple containing b and c, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100). If b is equal to c, 'YES' is being printed. If b is not equal to c, then if b is less than c, 'NO' is being printed. If b and c have the same parity, 'Yes' is being printed. Otherwise, 'No' is being printed.***
