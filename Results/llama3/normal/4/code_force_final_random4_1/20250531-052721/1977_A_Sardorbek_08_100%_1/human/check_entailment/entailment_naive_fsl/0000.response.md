Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program is correct because it correctly determines whether it is possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves. The program checks three conditions:

1. If b (the number of moves) is equal to c (the number of cubes), it prints "YES" because it is possible to build a tower with exactly c cubes in c moves.
2. If b is less than c, it prints "NO" because it is not possible to build a tower with more cubes than the number of moves.
3. If b is greater than c and b and c have the same parity (i.e., both are even or both are odd), it prints "YES" because it is possible to build a tower with exactly c cubes in b moves.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, and the logic is sound. Therefore, the program is correct.
