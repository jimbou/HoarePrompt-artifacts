Reasoning:

1. The problem statement asks us to determine if it's possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, Nikita either puts exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of the tower.

2. The given program defines a function `func()` that reads the number of test cases `a` and then iterates over each test case.

3. For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` representing the number of moves `n` and the desired number of cubes `m` respectively.

4. The program then checks the following conditions:
   - If `b` is equal to `c`, it prints 'YES' because Nikita can simply put 1 cube on top of the tower `b` times to get a tower with `c` cubes.
   - If `b` is less than `c`, it prints 'NO' because Nikita cannot get a tower with more cubes than the number of moves.
   - If `b` is greater than `c` and `b` and `c` have the same parity (i.e., both are even or both are odd), it prints 'Yes' because Nikita can put `c` cubes on top of the tower in `c` moves and then remove the remaining `b-c` cubes in `b-c` moves.
   - If `b` is greater than `c` and `b` and `c` have different parity, it prints 'No' because Nikita cannot get a tower with an odd number of cubes after an even number of moves or vice versa.

5. The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
