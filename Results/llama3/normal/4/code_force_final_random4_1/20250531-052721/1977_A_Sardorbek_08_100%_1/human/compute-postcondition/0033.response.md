The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `a` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 100. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `a` must be greater than 2.
State: **`a` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 100, `i` is 2, `b` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `c` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`, stdin contains `t-3` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n`, `m` <= 100). If `b` is equal to `c`, 'YES' is being printed. If `b` is not equal to `c`, then if `b` is less than `c`, 'NO' is being printed. If `b` and `c` have the same parity, 'Yes' is being printed. Otherwise, 'No' is being printed.**
