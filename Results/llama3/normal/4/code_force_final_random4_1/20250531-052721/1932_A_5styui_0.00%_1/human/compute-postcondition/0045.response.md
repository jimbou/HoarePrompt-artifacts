Output State: **`d` is an integer, `b` is a string of at least 1 character containing only '.', '@', and '*' characters, `a` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and greater than 1, `j` is 0, `s` is 0, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, and the first character of `b` is not '@'. The current value of `b[j]` is '*'. The string `b` is not empty and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. The string `b` still contains at least one character and only contains '.', '@', and '*' characters. The first character of `b` is still not '@'. The current value of `b[j]` is still '*'. The string `b` is still not empty.
