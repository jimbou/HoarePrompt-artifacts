Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of at least 2 characters containing only '.', '@', and '*' characters, `j` is 1, if the character at index `j` of string `b` is '@', then `s` is 2 and `i` is 0. If the character at index `j` of string `b` is not '@', then `s` is 1 and `i` is 0. If the character at index `j` of string `b` is '*', then if the string `b` is not empty, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if the character at index `j + 1` is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made, stdin contains t-2 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s` is incremented by 1. The values of `a`, `d`, `b`, and `j` remain the same. The conditions for `s` and `i` based on the character at index `j` of string `b` are updated accordingly. The stdin still contains t-2 test cases.
