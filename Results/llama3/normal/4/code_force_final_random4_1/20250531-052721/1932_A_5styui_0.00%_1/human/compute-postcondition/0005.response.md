Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, `s` is 1, `i` is 0, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of at least 1 character containing only '.', '@', and '*' characters, `j` is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, and the current value of `b[j]` is '@'.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-2 test cases, and the current value of `b[j]` is still '@'.
