Output State: **`d` is an integer, `b` is a string of at least 2 characters containing only '.', '@', and '*' characters where the character at index 2 is not '*', `a` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and greater than 1, `j` is 2, `s` is 3 if the first character of `b` is '@', otherwise `s` is 2, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been incremented by 1. If the first character of `b` is '@', then `s` is now 3; otherwise, `s` is now 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
