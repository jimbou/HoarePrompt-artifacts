Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of at least 2 characters containing only '.', '@', and '*' characters, `j` is 2, `s` is either 1 or 2, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `a`, `d`, `b`, `j`, `s`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement due to the `break` statement. The value of `s` is either 1 or 2, depending on the character at index `j` of string `b`. The value of `i` is still 0. The stdin still contains t-2 test cases.
