Postcondition: ***d is an integer equal to the input value, b is a string that has at least two characters, a is an integer between 3 and 1000 and greater than 2, j is 0, s is 0, i is 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases. If b[j + 1] == '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
