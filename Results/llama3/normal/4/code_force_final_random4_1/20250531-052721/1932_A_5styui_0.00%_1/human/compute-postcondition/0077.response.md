Output State: **d is an integer equal to the input value, b is a string of d characters containing only '.', '@', and '*' characters that must have at least 1 character, a is an integer between 3 and 1000 and greater than 2, j is 0, s is the number of '@' characters in the string b plus one, i is 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases. The current value of the character at index j in string b is '@'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of s is increased by 1, which means it now represents the total number of '@' characters in the string b plus one. All other variables remain unchanged.
