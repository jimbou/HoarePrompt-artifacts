To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `b`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of string `b`. If `b` has at least 1 character, the loop can execute. At the start of the loop, `j` should be 0 and `b` should have at least 1 character.

State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, `s` is 0, `i` is 0, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of at least 1 character containing only '.', '@', and '*' characters, `j` is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases**
