The only variable in the loop head is variable j and b, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable j and b. If j is less than the length of b, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, j is 0, b has at least 1 character. For the loop to execute again j must be 1 and b must have at least 2 characters.
State: **d is an integer equal to the input value, b is a string of d characters containing only '.', '@', and '*' characters that must have at least 2 characters, a is an integer between 3 and 1000 and greater than 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases. If the first character of string b is '@', then j is 1 and s is the number of '@' characters in the string b plus one. If the first character of string b is not '@', then j is 1, s is the number of '@' characters in the string b, and if the first character of string b is '*', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the first two characters of string b are '.', then i is 2.**
