Output State: **`d` is an integer, `b` is a string of at least 1 character containing only '.', '@', and '*' characters, `a` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and greater than 1, `j` is 0, `s` is 1, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases. The current value of `b` at index `j` is '@'.**

The value of `s` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The current value of `b` at index `j` is still '@'. The stdin still contains t-3 test cases.
