Output State: **d is an integer equal to the input value, b is a string of d characters containing only '.', '@', and '*' characters that must have at least 3 characters, a is an integer between 3 and 1000 and greater than 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases, i is 2, s is the number of '@' characters in the string b plus one or two, j is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables d, b, a, i, s, and j remain unchanged. The only change is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
