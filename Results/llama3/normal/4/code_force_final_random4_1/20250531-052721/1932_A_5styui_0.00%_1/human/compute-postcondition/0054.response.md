Output State: **`d` is an integer, `b` is a string of at least 1 character containing only '.', '@', and '*' characters, `a` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and greater than 1, `j` is 1, `s` is 2 if the first character of `b` is '@', otherwise `s` is 1, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases. If the first character of `b` is '*', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the first character of `b` is not '*' and `b` is not empty, and the character at index `j + 1` in string `b` is '*', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `s` has been incremented by 1. The value of `s` is now 2 if the first character of `b` is '@', otherwise it is 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
