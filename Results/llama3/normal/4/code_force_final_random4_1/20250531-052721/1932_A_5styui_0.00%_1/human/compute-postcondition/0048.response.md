Output State: **`d` is an integer, `b` is a string with at least 2 characters, `a` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and greater than 1, `j` is 0, `s` is 0, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, the character at index `j + 1` in string `b` is '*', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `d`, `b`, `a`, `j`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-3 test cases. The character at index `j + 1` in string `b` is still '*'. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
