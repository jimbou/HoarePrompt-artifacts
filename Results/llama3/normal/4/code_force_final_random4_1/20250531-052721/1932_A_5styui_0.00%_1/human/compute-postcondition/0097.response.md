The only object in the loop head is variable  j and b, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable j and the length of string b. If j is less than the length of string b, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, j is 1 and b has at least 2 characters. For the loop to execute again, j must be increased by 1 and b must have at least 3 characters.
State: **d is an integer equal to the input value, b is a string of d characters containing only '.', '@', and '*' characters that must have at least 3 characters, a is an integer between 3 and 1000 and greater than 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases, i is 2, s is the number of '@' characters in the string b plus one or two, j is 2**
