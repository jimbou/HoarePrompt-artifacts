Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, `s` is 0, `i` is 0, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string where the character at index `j` is '*', and if the character at index `j + 1` is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
