The `print(s)` statement will print the value of `s`, which is determined by the presence of '@' characters in the string `b`.

If the string `b` contains at least one '@' character, then `s` is equal to the number of '@' characters in the string `b`. In this case, the print statement will output the count of '@' characters in the string `b`.

If the string `b` does not contain any '@' characters, then `s` is 0. In this case, the print statement will output 0.

Since the exact string `b` is not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `s`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output either the count of '@' characters in the string `b` or 0.

Output: **the count of '@' characters in the string b if b contains at least one '@' character, otherwise 0**
