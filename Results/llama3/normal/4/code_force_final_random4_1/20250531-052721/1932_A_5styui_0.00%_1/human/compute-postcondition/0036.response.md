Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters containing only '.', '@', and '*' characters, `j` is `d-1`, `s` is 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been changed to 0, regardless of whether the string `b` contains '@' characters or not. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains t-2 test cases.
