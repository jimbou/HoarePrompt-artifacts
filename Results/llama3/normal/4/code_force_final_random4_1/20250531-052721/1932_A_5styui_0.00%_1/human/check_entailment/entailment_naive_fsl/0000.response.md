Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to collect the maximum number of coins. The issue lies in the fact that the program simply counts the number of '@' characters in the string, without considering the movement restrictions imposed by the '*' characters.

A counterexample is the input:

5
..*@*

The program will output 1, but the correct output should be 0, because the '*' character blocks the path to the '@' character.

The program does not take into account the fact that you can move one or two cells along the path, and that you cannot move to a cell with a '*' character. It simply counts the number of '@' characters, without considering the movement restrictions.

To correctly solve this problem, you would need to implement a dynamic programming approach that takes into account the movement restrictions and the fact that you can move one or two cells along the path.
