Postcondition: ***`d` is an integer, `b` is a string with at least 2 characters, `a` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and greater than 1, `j` is 0, `s` is 0, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases. If the character at index `j + 1` in string `b` is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
