Output State: **d is an integer equal to the input value, b is a non-empty string of d characters containing only '.', '@', and '*' characters, a is an integer between 3 and 1000 and greater than 2, j is 0, s is the number of '@' characters in the string b, i is 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases, and the first character of string b is not '@'. The current value of b[j] is '*', and the string b is not empty, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. The stdin now contains t-5 test cases.
