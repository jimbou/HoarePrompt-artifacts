Output State: **d is an integer equal to the input value, b is a string that has at least two characters, a is an integer between 3 and 1000 and greater than 2, j is 0, s is 0, i is 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their initial values, as the `break` statement does not modify any variables. The only change is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement we were directly inside.
