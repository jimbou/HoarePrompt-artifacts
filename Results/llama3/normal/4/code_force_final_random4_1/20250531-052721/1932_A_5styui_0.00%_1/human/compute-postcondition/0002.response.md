Output State: **a is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, s is 0, i is 0, d is an integer between 1 and 50, b is a string of d characters containing only '.', '@', and '*' characters, stdin contains t-2 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `a` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `s` also remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `i` is 0 and remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, which is the value of the first input. The value of `b` is a string of `d` characters containing only '.', '@', and '*' characters, which is the value of the second input. Stdin contains t-2 test cases as two test cases have been consumed by the code.
