Postcondition: ***`d` is an integer, `b` is a string of at least 0 character containing only '.', '@', and '*' characters, `a` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and greater than 1, `j` is 1, `s` is 1 if the first character of `b` is '@', otherwise `s` is 0, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-4 test cases. If the character at index `j + 1` in string `b` is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
