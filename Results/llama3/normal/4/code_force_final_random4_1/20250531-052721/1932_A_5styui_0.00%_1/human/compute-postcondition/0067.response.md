Postcondition: ***`d` is an integer, `b` is a string of at least 2 characters containing only '.', '@', and '*' characters where the character at index 2 is not '*', `a` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and greater than 1, `j` is 2, `s` is 2 if the first character of `b` is '@', otherwise `s` is 1, `i` is 1, and stdin contains t-3 test cases. If the first character of `b` is '@', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if the character at index j+1 of `b` is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
