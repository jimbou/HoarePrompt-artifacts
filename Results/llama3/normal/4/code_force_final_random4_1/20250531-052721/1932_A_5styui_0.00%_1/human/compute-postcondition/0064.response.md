Output State: **`d` is an integer, `b` is a string of at least 2 characters containing only '.', '@', and '*' characters where the character at index 2 is not '*', `a` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and greater than 1, `j` is 2, `s` is 2 if the first character of `b` is '@', otherwise `s` is 1, `i` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, stdin contains t-3 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `d`, `b`, `a`, `j`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains t-3 test cases.
