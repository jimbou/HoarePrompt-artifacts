Output State: **d is an integer equal to the input value, b is a string of d characters containing only '.', '@', and '*' characters that must have at least 2 characters, a is an integer between 3 and 1000 and greater than 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases. If the first character of string b is '@', then j is 1 and s is the number of '@' characters in the string b plus two. If the first character of string b is not '@', then j is 1, s is the number of '@' characters in the string b plus one, and if the first character of string b is '*', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the first two characters of string b are '.', then i is 2.**

In this output state, the value of s has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for j, s, and i are still dependent on the first character of string b. If the first character of string b is '@', then s is now the number of '@' characters in the string b plus two. If the first character of string b is not '@', then s is now the number of '@' characters in the string b plus one. The program still breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if the first character of string b is '*'. The value of i is still 2 if the first two characters of string b are '.'.
