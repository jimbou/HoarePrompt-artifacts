State: **`d` is an integer, `b` is a string of at least 1 character containing only '.', '@', and '*' characters, `a` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and greater than 1, `j` is 1, `s` is 1 if the first character of `b` is '@', otherwise `s` is 0, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases. If the first character of `b` is '*', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the first character of `b` is not '*' and `b` is not empty, and the character at index `j + 1` in string `b` is '*', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
