Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: d is an integer equal to the input value, b is a string of d characters containing only '.', '@', and '*' characters, a is an integer between 3 and 1000 and greater than 2, j is d-1, s is the number of '@' characters in the string b, i is 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(len(b)):
    if b[j] == '@':
        s = s + 1
    elif b[j] == '*':
        if b[:]:
            break
        elif b[j + 1] == '*':
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *d is an integer equal to the input value, b is a string of d characters containing only '.', '@', and '*' characters that must have at least 1 character, a is an integer between 3 and 1000 and greater than 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases. If the first character of string b is '@', then j is 0 and s is the number of '@' characters in the string b plus one. If the first character of string b is not '@', then j is 0, s is the number of '@' characters in the string b, and if the first character of string b is '*', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the first two characters of string b are '.', then i is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: d is an integer equal to the input value, b is a string of d characters containing only '.', '@', and '*' characters that must have at least 2 characters, a is an integer between 3 and 1000 and greater than 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases. If the first character of string b is '@', then j is 1 and s is the number of '@' characters in the string b plus two. If the first character of string b is not '@', then j is 1, s is the number of '@' characters in the string b plus one, and if the first character of string b is '*', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the first two characters of string b are '.', then i is 2. If the character at index j of string b is '*', then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the character at index j+1 of string b is '*', then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *d is an integer equal to the input value, b is a string of d characters containing only '.', '@', and '*' characters that must have at least 3 characters, a is an integer between 3 and 1000 and greater than 2. If b[j] is '@', then s is the number of '@' characters in the string b plus two or three. Otherwise, if b is empty, stdin contains t-5 test cases and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If b[j + 1] is '*', then stdin contains t-5 test cases, otherwise stdin contains t-4 test cases. In all cases, i is 2, and j is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
