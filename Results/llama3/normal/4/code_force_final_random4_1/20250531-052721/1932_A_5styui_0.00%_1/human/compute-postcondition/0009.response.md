Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, `s` is 0, `i` is 0, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of at least 1 character containing only '.', '@', and '*' characters, `j` is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, the character at index `j` of string `b` is not '@', the current value of the character at index `j` of string `b` is '*', and the string `b` is not empty, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables `a`, `s`, `i`, `d`, `b`, and `j` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-2 test cases. The character at index `j` of string `b` is still not '@' and is still '*', and the string `b` is still not empty. However, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement that we were directly inside.
