Postcondition: ***d is an integer equal to the input value, b is a string of d characters containing only '.', '@', and '*' characters that must have at least 3 characters, a is an integer between 3 and 1000 and greater than 2. If b is empty, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and stdin contains t-5 test cases. Otherwise, if b[j + 1] == '*', then stdin contains t-5 test cases, otherwise stdin contains t-4 test cases. In all cases, i is 2, s is the number of '@' characters in the string b plus one or two, and j is 2.***
