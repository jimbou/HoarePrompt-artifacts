The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `d`. Since stdin contains `t-3` test cases, after this line, stdin will contain `t-4` test cases. The second line assigns the string value of the input to `b`. Since the number of '@' characters in the string `b` is being printed, the value of `s` will be updated to the number of '@' characters in the new string `b`.

Output State: **d is an integer equal to the input value, b is a string of d characters containing only '.', '@', and '*' characters, a is an integer between 3 and 1000 and greater than 2, j is d-1, s is the number of '@' characters in the string b, i is 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases.**
