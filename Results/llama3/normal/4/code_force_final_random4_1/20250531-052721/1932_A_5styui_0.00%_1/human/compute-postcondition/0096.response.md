Postcondition: **d is an integer equal to the input value, b is a string of d characters containing only '.', '@', and '*' characters that must have at least 2 characters, a is an integer between 3 and 1000 and greater than 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases. If the first character of string b is '@', then j is 1 and s is the number of '@' characters in the string b plus two. If the first character of string b is not '@', then j is 1, s is the number of '@' characters in the string b plus one, and if the first character of string b is '*', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the first two characters of string b are '.', then i is 2. If the character at index j of string b is '*', then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the character at index j+1 of string b is '*', then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
