Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of at least 2 characters containing only '.', '@', and '*' characters, `j` is 2, `s` is either 1 or 2, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases. If the character at index `j + 1` of string `b` is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
