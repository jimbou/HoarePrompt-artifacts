Output State: **`d` is an integer, `b` is a string of at least 0 character containing only '.', '@', and '*' characters, `a` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and greater than 1, `j` is 1, `s` is 1 if the first character of `b` is '@', otherwise `s` is 0, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-4 test cases and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `d` remains an integer. The string `b` still contains only '.', '@', and '*' characters, but its length is now at least 0 because we have broken out of the loop or if statement and moved to the next test case. The value of `a` is still an integer between 2 and 1000 and greater than 1. The values of `j`, `s`, and `i` remain the same. We have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. The number of test cases in stdin has decreased by 1.
