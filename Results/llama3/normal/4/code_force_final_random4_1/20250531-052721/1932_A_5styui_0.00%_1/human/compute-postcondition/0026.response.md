Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of at least 2 characters containing only '.', '@', and '*' characters, `j` is 2, stdin contains t-2 test cases. If the character at index `j` of string `b` is '@', then `s` is 3 and `i` is 0. If the character at index `j` of string `b` is not '@', then `s` is 2 and `i` is 0. If the character at index `j` of string `b` is '*', then if the string `b` is not empty, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if the character at index `j + 1` is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made. If the string `b` is empty, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, we continue with the next iteration.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been incremented by 1. If the character at index `j` of string `b` is '@', then `s` is now 3. If the character at index `j` of string `b` is not '@', then `s` is now 2. The values of the other variables remain the same. The conditions for breaking out of the loop or if statement also remain the same.
