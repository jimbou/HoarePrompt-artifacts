Output State: **d is an integer equal to the input value, b is a string of d characters containing only '.', '@', and '*' characters that must have at least 3 characters, a is an integer between 3 and 1000 and greater than 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases, i is 2, s is the number of '@' characters in the string b plus two or three, j is 2**

The code increments the value of s by 1. Since s was initially equal to the number of '@' characters in the string b plus one or two, it is now equal to the number of '@' characters in the string b plus two or three. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
