Postcondition: ***`d` is an integer, `b` is a string of at least 2 characters containing only '.', '@', and '*' characters where the character at index 2 is not '*', `a` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and greater than 1, `j` is 2, `i` is 1, and stdin contains t-3 test cases. If the character at index 2 of `b` is '@', then `s` is 3. Otherwise, if the first character of `b` is '@', then `s` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the first character of `b` is not '@' and the character at index j+1 of `b` is '*', then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `s` is 2 if the first character of `b` is '@', otherwise `s` is 1, and no changes are made.***
