Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of at least 2 characters containing only '.', '@', and '*' characters, `j` is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases. If the character at index `j` of string `b` is '@', then `s` is 1 and `i` is 0. If the character at index `j` of string `b` is not '@', then `s` is 0 and `i` is 0. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `a`, `d`, `b`, and `j` remain unchanged. The stdin now contains t-3 test cases. The values of `s` and `i` are still dependent on the character at index `j` of string `b`. However, since the code executes a break statement, we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
