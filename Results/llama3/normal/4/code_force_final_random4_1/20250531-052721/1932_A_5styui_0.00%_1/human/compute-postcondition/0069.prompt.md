Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: d is an integer, b is a string of d characters containing only '.', '@', and '*' characters, a is an integer between 2 and 1000 and greater than 1, j is d-1, s is 0, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(len(b)):
    if b[j] == '@':
        s = s + 1
    elif b[j] == '*':
        if b[:]:
            break
        elif b[j + 1] == '*':
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`d` is an integer, `b` is a string of at least 1 character containing only '.', '@', and '*' characters, `a` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and greater than 1, `j` is 0, `s` is 1 if the first character of `b` is '@', otherwise `s` is 0, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases. If the first character of `b` is '*', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the first character of `b` is not '*' and `b` is not empty, and the character at index `j + 1` in string `b` is '*', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`d` is an integer, `b` is a string of at least 1 character containing only '.', '@', and '*' characters, `a` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and greater than 1, `j` is 1, `s` is 2 if the first character of `b` is '@', otherwise `s` is 1, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases. If the first character of `b` is '*', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the first character of `b` is not '*' and `b` is not empty, and the character at index `j + 1` in string `b` is '*', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made. If the character at index `j` in string `b` is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`d` is an integer, `b` is a string of at least 2 characters containing only '.', '@', and '*' characters where the character at index 2 is not '*', `a` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and greater than 1, `j` is 2, `i` is 1, and stdin contains t-3 test cases. If the character at index 2 of `b` is '@', then `s` is 3. Otherwise, if the first character of `b` is '@', then `s` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the first character of `b` is not '@' and the character at index j+1 of `b` is '*', then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `s` is 2 if the first character of `b` is '@', otherwise `s` is 1, and no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
