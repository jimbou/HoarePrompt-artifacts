Postcondition: ***d is an integer equal to the input value, b is a string of d characters containing only '.', '@', and '*' characters that must have at least 1 character, a is an integer between 3 and 1000 and greater than 2, j is 0, s is the number of '@' characters in the string b, i is 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases, and the first character of string b is not '@'. If b is not empty, the current value of b[j] is '*', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If b is empty, no changes are made. If b has at least two characters and b[j + 1] == '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
