The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `a` must be greater than 2.
State: **`d` is an integer, `b` is a string of `d` characters containing only '.', '@', and '*' characters, `a` is an integer between 3 and 1000 and greater than 2, `j` is `d-1`, `s` is 0, `i` is 2, stdin contains `t-3` test cases, and the number of '@' characters in the string `b` which is `s` is being printed**
