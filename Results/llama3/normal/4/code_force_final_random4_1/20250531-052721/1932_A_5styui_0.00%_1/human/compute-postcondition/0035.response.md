Output: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters containing only '.', '@', and '*' characters, `j` is `d-1`, stdin contains t-2 test cases. If the string `b` contains at least one '@' character, then `s` is equal to the number of '@' characters in the string `b` and `i` is 0. If the string `b` does not contain any '@' characters, then `s` is 0 and `i` is 0., and the number of '@' characters in the string `b` which is `s` is being printed**
