Output State: **The program returns a list containing two strings. The first string is the value of `l + 1`, where `l` is an integer from 1 to `n` and is equal to `r`. The second string is the value of `array.index(find) + 1`, where `array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, and `array.index(find)` is the index of `find` in `array`. The index of `find` in `array` is not equal to the current value of `l`.**
