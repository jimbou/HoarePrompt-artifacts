Output State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` is an integer greater than 1 and equal to its original value, `r` is greater than `n/2 + 1`, `l` is equal to `(l + r) // 2`, `mid` is an integer equal to `(l + r) // 2`**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to be equal to `mid`, which is the average of the original `l` and `r`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `array` still contains distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, and `find` is still an integer from 1 to `n`. The value of `n` is still greater than 1 and remains unchanged. The value of `r` is still greater than `n/2 + 1`. The value of `mid` is still the average of `l` and `r`, but now `l` is equal to this average.
