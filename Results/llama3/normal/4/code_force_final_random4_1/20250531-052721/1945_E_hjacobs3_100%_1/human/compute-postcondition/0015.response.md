Output State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` is an integer greater than 1 and equal to its original value, `mid` is an integer equal to `(l + r) // 2`, `l` is now equal to `mid`, `r - l` must be greater than or equal to 1, `mid` is updated to be the average of `l` and `r`**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of integers, the integer to be found, and the total number of integers remain unchanged. The middle index is still the average of the left and right indices. The left index is now updated to be equal to the middle index. The difference between the right and left indices is now greater than or equal to 1.
