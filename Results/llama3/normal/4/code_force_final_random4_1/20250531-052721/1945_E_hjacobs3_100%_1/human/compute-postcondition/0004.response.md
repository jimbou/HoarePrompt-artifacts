Output State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` is an integer greater than 1 and equal to its original value, `l` is `n/2`, `r` is `n`, `mid` is `n/2`, and the current value of `array[mid]` is less than or equal to `find`.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to `n/2`, which is the same as the value of `mid`. The other variables remain unchanged. The array still contains distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, and the value of `array[mid]` is still less than or equal to `find`. The values of `find`, `n`, and `r` are unchanged.
