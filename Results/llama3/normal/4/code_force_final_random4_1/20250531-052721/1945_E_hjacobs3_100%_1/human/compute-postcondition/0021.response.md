Output: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` is an integer equal to its original value, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is an integer from 1 to `n`. The current value of `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in `array`, and 1 is being printed**
