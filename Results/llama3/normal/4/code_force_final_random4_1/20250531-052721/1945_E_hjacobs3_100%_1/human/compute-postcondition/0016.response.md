Output State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` is an integer greater than 1 and equal to its original value, `mid` is an integer equal to `(l + r) // 2`, `r` is updated to be equal to `mid`, `r - l` is greater than or equal to 1, `mid` is updated to be the average of `l` and `r`**

In this output state, the value of `r` has been updated to be equal to `mid`, which is the average of `l` and `r`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition `r - l` is greater than 1 is no longer guaranteed, as `r` is now equal to `mid`, which could be closer to `l`. However, `r - l` is still greater than or equal to 1.
