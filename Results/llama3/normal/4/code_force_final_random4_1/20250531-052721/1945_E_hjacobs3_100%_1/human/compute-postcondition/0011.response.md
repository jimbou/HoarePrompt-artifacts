Output State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` is an integer greater than 1 and equal to its original value, `r` is equal to `(l + r) // 2`, `l` is less than `n/2`, `mid` is an integer equal to `(l + r) // 2`**

In this output state, the value of `r` has been updated to be equal to `mid`, which is the average of `l` and `r`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that since `r` was originally greater than `n/2 + 1`, its new value is still greater than `n/2`, but it is now equal to the average of `l` and `r`.
