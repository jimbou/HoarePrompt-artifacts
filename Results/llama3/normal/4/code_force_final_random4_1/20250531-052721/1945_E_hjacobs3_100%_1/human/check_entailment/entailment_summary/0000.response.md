Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It performs a binary search on the input array to find the target number `x`. If the target number is not found at the expected index, it prints 1 and returns a list containing the expected index and the actual index of the target number. If the target number is found at the expected index, it prints 0.

The program correctly implements the binary search algorithm and handles the case where the target number is not found at the expected index. It also correctly prints the number of operations performed (0 or 1) and the indices of the elements to be swapped if necessary.

Correctness: **True**
