Output State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` is an integer greater than 1 and equal to its original value, `r` is greater than `n/2 + 1`, `l` is less than `n/2`, `mid` is an integer equal to `(l + r) // 2`**.

In this output state, the value of `mid` is calculated as the average of `l` and `r`, rounded down to the nearest integer. Since `l` is less than `n/2` and `r` is greater than `n/2 + 1`, the value of `mid` will be greater than or equal to `n/2` and less than or equal to `n/2 + 1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
