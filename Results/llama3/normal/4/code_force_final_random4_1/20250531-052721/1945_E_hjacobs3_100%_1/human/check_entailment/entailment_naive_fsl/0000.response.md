Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The problem description states that the goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x. However, the program does not guarantee this.

For example, consider the input:

5
1 2 3 4 5

The program will output:

0

However, the correct output should be:

2
1 3
3 5

Because the program does not perform the necessary swaps to ensure that p_l is equal to x after the algorithm is executed.

The program only checks if l is equal to the index of the find element, and if not, it prints 1 and returns the indices of l and the find element. However, this is not sufficient to guarantee that p_l is equal to x after the algorithm is executed.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
