Functionality: **This function searches for a target integer `find` in a list of distinct integers `array` from 1 to `n` and returns a list containing two strings if the target is not found at the expected index, or prints 0 if the target is found at the expected index. The function performs a binary search to find the target and returns the index of the target in the list and the expected index if they do not match. If the target is found at the expected index, the function prints 0 and does not return any value.**
