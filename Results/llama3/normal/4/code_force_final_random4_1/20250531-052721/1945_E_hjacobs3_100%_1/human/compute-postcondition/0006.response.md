Output State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` is an integer greater than 1 and equal to its original value, `l` is 0, `r` is `n/2`, `mid` is `n/2`, and `array[mid]` is greater than `find`**

In this output state, the value of `r` has been updated to `n/2`, which is the same as the value of `mid`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `array` still contains distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, and `find` is still an integer from 1 to `n`. The value of `n` is still greater than 1 and remains the same as its original value. The value of `l` is still 0, and `mid` is still `n/2`. Additionally, `array[mid]` is still greater than `find`.
