#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, find is an integer from 1 to n.
    n = len(array)
    l, r = 0, n
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        
        if array[mid] <= find:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
        
    #State: `array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` is an integer equal to its original value, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is an integer from 1 to `n`
    if (l != array.index(find)) :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        return [str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)]
        #The program returns a list containing two strings. The first string is the value of `l + 1`, where `l` is an integer from 1 to `n` and is equal to `r`. The second string is the value of `array.index(find) + 1`, where `array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, and `array.index(find)` is the index of `find` in `array`. The index of `find` in `array` is not equal to the current value of `l`.
    else :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    #State: `array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` is an integer equal to its original value, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is an integer from 1 to `n`, and `l` is equal to the index of `find` in `array`, and the number 0 is being printed

#Overall this is what the function does:This function searches for a target integer `find` in a list of distinct integers `array` from 1 to `n` and returns a list containing two strings if the target is not found at the expected index, or prints 0 if the target is found at the expected index. The function performs a binary search to find the target and returns the index of the target in the list and the expected index if they do not match. If the target is found at the expected index, the function prints 0 and does not return any value.
