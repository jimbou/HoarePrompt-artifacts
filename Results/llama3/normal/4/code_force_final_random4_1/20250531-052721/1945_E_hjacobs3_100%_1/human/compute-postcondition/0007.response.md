Postcondition: ***`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` is an integer greater than 1 and equal to its original value. After the if-else block, if `array[mid]` is less than or equal to `find`, then `l` is updated to `n/2` and `r` remains `n`. Otherwise, `l` remains 0 and `r` is updated to `n/2`.***
