Output State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` is an integer greater than 1 and equal to its original value, `mid` is an integer equal to `(l + r) // 2`, `r - l` must be greater than 1, `mid` is updated to be the average of `l` and `r`**.

In natural language, the output state is: The list of integers, the value to be found, and the total number of elements remain unchanged. The middle index is recalculated as the average of the left and right indices, and the difference between the right and left indices is still greater than 1.
