Postcondition: ***`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` is an integer greater than 1 and equal to its original value, `mid` is an integer equal to `(l + r) // 2`, `r - l` is greater than or equal to 1, `mid` is updated to be the average of `l` and `r`. If `array[mid]` is less than or equal to `find`, `l` is updated to be equal to `mid`. Otherwise, `r` is updated to be equal to `mid`.***
