Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly implements the binary search algorithm to find the target integer `find` in the list `array`.
2. The program correctly handles the case where the target is not found at the expected index by printing 1 and returning a list containing the expected index and the actual index of the target.
3. The program correctly handles the case where the target is found at the expected index by printing 0 and not returning any value.
4. The program correctly assumes that the input list `array` contains distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, and that the target integer `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`.
5. The program correctly uses the `index()` method to find the actual index of the target in the list, and compares it with the expected index `l` to determine whether the target is found at the expected index.

Overall, the program correctly implements the binary search algorithm and handles the different cases correctly, making it a correct solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
