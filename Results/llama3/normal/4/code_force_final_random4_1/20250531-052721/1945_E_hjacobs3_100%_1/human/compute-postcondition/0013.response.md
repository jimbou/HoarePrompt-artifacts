The variables in the loop head are `r` and `l`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the difference between `r` and `l`. If `r - l` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `r - l` is greater than 1. To ensure that the loop can execute again, `r - l` must be greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` is an integer greater than 1 and equal to its original value, `mid` is an integer equal to `(l + r) // 2`, `r - l` must be greater than 1**
