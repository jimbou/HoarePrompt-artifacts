To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `r - l > 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order.
- `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`.
- `n` is an integer equal to its original value.
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is `n`.

The condition `r - l > 1` depends on the values of `r` and `l`. Since `l` is 0 and `r` is `n`, for the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` is an integer greater than 1 and equal to its original value, `l` is 0, `r` is `n`**
