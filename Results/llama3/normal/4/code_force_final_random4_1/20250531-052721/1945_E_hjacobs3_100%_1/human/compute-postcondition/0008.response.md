The variables in the loop head are `r` and `l`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the difference between `r` and `l`. If `r - l` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `r` is `n` and `l` is `n/2`. For the loop to execute again, `r` must be greater than `n/2 + 1` and `l` must be less than `n/2`. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `find` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `n` is an integer greater than 1 and equal to its original value, `r` is greater than `n/2 + 1`, `l` is less than `n/2`**
