The code snippet consists of three lines. The first line assigns the length of the `array` to `n`. Since `array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, the length of `array` is equal to `n`. Therefore, `n` becomes equal to its original value.

The second line assigns the values 0 and `n` to `l` and `r`, respectively. Since `n` is equal to its original value, `l` becomes 0 and `r` becomes the original value of `n`.

The third line does not affect any variables.

Output State: **array is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, find is an integer from 1 to n, n is an integer equal to its original value, l is 0, r is n**
