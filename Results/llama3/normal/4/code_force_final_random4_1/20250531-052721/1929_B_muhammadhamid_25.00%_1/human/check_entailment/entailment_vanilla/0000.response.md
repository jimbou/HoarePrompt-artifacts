Reasoning:

The problem requires us to find the minimum number of cells that need to be colored in an n x n grid such that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell.

The program provided uses the following logic:

- If k is 1, it prints 1 because only one cell needs to be colored to cover one diagonal.
- If k is less than or equal to 2n, it prints the ceiling of k/2. This is because each diagonal can be covered by coloring one cell, and we need to cover at least k diagonals. Since each cell can cover two diagonals (one in each direction), we need to color at least k/2 cells.
- If k is greater than 2n, it prints k/2 + 1. This is because we need to color at least k/2 cells to cover k diagonals, but since k is greater than 2n, we need to color one more cell to cover the remaining diagonals.

This logic is correct based on the problem description. The program correctly handles all possible cases and provides the minimum number of cells that need to be colored.

Correctness: **True**
