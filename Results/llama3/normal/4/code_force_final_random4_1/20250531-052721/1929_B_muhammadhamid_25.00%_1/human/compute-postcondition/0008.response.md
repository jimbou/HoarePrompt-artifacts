The code prints the ceiling of the division of `k` by 2, where `k` is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2 (inclusive) and `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive). Since `k` is less than or equal to 2 times the value of `n`, the ceiling of `k / 2` will be at most `n`.
Output: **math.ceil(k / 2) (where k is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2 and n is an integer between 2 and 10^8)**
