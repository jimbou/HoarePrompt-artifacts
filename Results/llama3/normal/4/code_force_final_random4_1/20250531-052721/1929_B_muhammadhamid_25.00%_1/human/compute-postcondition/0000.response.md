To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and the expression `int(input())`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `int(input())`, which should be at least 1.

State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t lines, each containing two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^8, 1 <= k <= 4n - 2), int(input()) is at least 1**
