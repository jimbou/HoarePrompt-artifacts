The code prints the ceiling of the division of `k` by 2, where `k` is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2 (inclusive) and `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive). Since `k` is less than or equal to 2 times the value of `n`, the ceiling of `k / 2` will be at most `n`.
Output: ** `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2 (inclusive), stdin contains t - 1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^8, 1 <= k <= 4n - 2), int(input()) is at least 1. If `k` equals 1, the number 1 is printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no action is taken. The current value of `k` is less than or equal to 2 times the value of `n`, and the ceiling of k/2 is printed, which is at most n**
