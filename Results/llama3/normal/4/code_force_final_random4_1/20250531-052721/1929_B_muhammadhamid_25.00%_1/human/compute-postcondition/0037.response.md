Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers, n and k. It then prints the ceiling of k divided by 2 if k is less than or equal to 2n, or k divided by 2 plus 1 if k is greater than 2n. If k is 1, it simply prints 1. The function processes all test cases and then exits, leaving the standard input empty.**
