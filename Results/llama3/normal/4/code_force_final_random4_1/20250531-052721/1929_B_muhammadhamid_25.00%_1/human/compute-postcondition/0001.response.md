The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` assigns the values of two integers from the input to the variables `n` and `k`. The stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t lines, each containing two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^8, 1 <= k <= 4n - 2). The first line of the input is read and split into two integers, which are assigned to `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2 (inclusive), stdin contains t - 1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^8, 1 <= k <= 4n - 2), int(input()) is at least 1**
