Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^8, 1 <= k <= 4n - 2), int(input()) is at least 1. If `k` is 1, the number 1 is printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if `k` is less than or equal to 2n, the ceiling of k divided by 2 is printed. If `k` is greater than 2n, the value of k // 2 + 1 is printed.***
