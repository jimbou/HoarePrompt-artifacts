Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^8, 1 <= k <= 4n - 2), int(input()) is at least 1**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` have been updated to the values read from the input. The range of `n` and `k` remains the same as in the initial state, but the specific values have been updated. The stdin now contains one less line, as one line has been read and processed. The condition `int(input()) is at least 1` is still valid, as the input has been processed and the remaining lines in stdin still meet this condition.
