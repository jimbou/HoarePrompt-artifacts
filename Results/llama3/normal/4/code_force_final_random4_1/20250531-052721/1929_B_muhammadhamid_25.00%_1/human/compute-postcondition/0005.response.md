Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive), `k` is an integer and equals 1, stdin contains t - 1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^8, 1 <= k <= 4n - 2), int(input()) is at least 1, and the number 1 is being printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. The values of `n`, `k`, and the contents of `stdin` remain unchanged. The program will proceed to the next iteration of the loop, if any.
