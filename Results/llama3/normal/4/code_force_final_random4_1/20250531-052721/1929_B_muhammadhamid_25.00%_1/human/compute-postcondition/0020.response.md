The `print(math.ceil(k / 2))` statement will print the ceiling of the division of `k` by 2.
Since `k` is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2 (inclusive), the value of `k / 2` will be a number between 0.5 and 2n - 1 (inclusive).
The `math.ceil` function will round up this value to the nearest integer.
Output: **the ceiling of k/2 (where k is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2)**
