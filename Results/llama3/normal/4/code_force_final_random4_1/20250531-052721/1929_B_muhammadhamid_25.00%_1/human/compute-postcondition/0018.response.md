Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2 (inclusive), stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^8, 1 <= k <= 4n - 2), int(input()) is at least 1, and the number 1 is being printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` remain the same as they were in the initial state. The stdin still contains `t-2` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, but one line has been read and processed. The value of `int(input())` is still at least 1, and the number 1 is still being printed. The only change is that we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement.
