The only variable in the loop head is the variable `_` and `int(input())`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `int(input())`. If `int(input())` is at least 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `int(input())` is at least 1, stdin contains t - 1 lines. So for the loop to be executed one more time stdin must contain t lines and `int(input())` is at least 2.
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2 (inclusive), stdin contains t lines, each containing two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^8, 1 <= k <= 4n - 2), int(input()) is at least 2**
