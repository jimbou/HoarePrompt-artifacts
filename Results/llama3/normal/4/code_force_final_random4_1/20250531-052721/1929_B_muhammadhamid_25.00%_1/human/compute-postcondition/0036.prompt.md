Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t lines, each containing two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^8, 1 <= k <= 4n - 2).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if k == 1:
        print(1)
        continue
    if k <= 2 * n:
        print(math.ceil(k / 2))
    else:
        print(k // 2 + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2 (inclusive), stdin contains t - 1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^8, 1 <= k <= 4n - 2), int(input()) is at least 1. If `k` equals 1, the number 1 is printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if `k` is less than or equal to 2 times the value of `n`, the ceiling of k/2 is printed, which is at most n. If `k` is larger than 2n, k // 2 + 1 is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^8, 1 <= k <= 4n - 2), int(input()) is at least 1. If `k` is 1, the number 1 is printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if `k` is less than or equal to 2n, the ceiling of k divided by 2 is printed. If `k` is greater than 2n, the value of k // 2 + 1 is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2 (inclusive), stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^8, 1 <= k <= 4n - 2), int(input()) is at least 0. If `k` is 1, the number 1 is printed and we move to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if `k` is less than or equal to 2n, the ceiling of k divided by 2 is printed, which is the ceiling of an integer between 1 and 2n - 1 (inclusive) divided by 2. If `k` is greater than 2n, k // 2 + 1 is printed, where k is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2 (inclusive) and n is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
