The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration. Since we are already inside a loop, the `continue` statement will move to the next iteration of the loop. The values of the variables `n`, `k`, and the stdin are not affected. The number 1 is still being printed. The `int(input())` is still at least 0. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2 (inclusive), stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^8, 1 <= k <= 4n - 2), int(input()) is at least 0, the number 1 is being printed, and we move to the next iteration of the loop.**
