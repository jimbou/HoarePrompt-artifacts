Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2 (inclusive), stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^8, 1 <= k <= 4n - 2), int(input()) is at least 0**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` have been updated to the new values read from the input. The range of `n` and `k` remains the same as in the initial state, but the specific values have changed. The stdin now contains `t-3` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, because one line has been read and processed. The value of `int(input())` is still at least 0, as it was in the initial state.
