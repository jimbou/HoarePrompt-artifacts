Output: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2 (inclusive), stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^8, 1 <= k <= 4n - 2), int(input()) is at least 0. If `k` is 1, the number 1 is printed and we move to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no action is taken. and this is printed: k // 2 + 1, where k is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2 (inclusive) and n is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive)**
