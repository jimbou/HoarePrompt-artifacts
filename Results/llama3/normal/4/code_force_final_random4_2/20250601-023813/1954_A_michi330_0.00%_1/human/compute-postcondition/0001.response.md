The only variables in the loop head are variables `itest` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), which ensures that the loop will execute. However, we need to adjust the state of `itest` to reflect the initial value of the loop counter.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `itest` is 0, stdin contains t lines, each containing three integers n, m, and k (1 <= m, k <= n <= 50)**
