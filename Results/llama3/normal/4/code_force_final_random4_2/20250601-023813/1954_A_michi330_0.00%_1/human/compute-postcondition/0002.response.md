Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `itest` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive), stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing three integers n, m, and k (1 <= m, k <= n <= 50)**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `itest` remain unchanged. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of the three integers from the first line of the input, which are between 1 and 50 (inclusive). The stdin now contains `t-1` lines, each containing three integers n, m, and k (1 <= m, k <= n <= 50).
