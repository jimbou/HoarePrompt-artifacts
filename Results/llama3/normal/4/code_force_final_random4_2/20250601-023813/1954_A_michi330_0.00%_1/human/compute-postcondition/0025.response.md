Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers n, m, and k. It then determines whether a certain condition is met, specifically whether n is greater than k and n minus the ceiling of n divided by m is also greater than k. If the condition is met, it prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function processes multiple test cases and prints the result for each case.**
