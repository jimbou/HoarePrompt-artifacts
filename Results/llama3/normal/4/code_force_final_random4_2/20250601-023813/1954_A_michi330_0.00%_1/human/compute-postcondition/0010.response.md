To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `itest` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `itest` is less than `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `itest` is 0, and `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). To execute the loop again, `itest` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `itest` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive), stdin contains `t-2` lines, each containing three integers n, m, and k (1 <= m, k <= n <= 50)**
