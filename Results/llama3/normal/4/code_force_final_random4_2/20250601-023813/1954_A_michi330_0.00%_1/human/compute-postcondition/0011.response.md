Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `itest` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive), stdin contains `t-3` lines, each containing three integers n, m, and k (1 <= m, k <= n <= 50)**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `itest`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated based on the input from stdin. The new values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers between 1 and 50 (inclusive), where `m` and `k` are between 1 and `n` (inclusive). The stdin now contains `t-3` lines, each containing three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` (1 <= m, k <= n <= 50).
