The only variables in the loop head are variables  itest and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `itest` and `t`. If `itest` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `itest` is 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `itest` must be increased by 1 and `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `itest` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive), stdin contains `t-4` lines, each containing three integers n, m, and k (1 <= m, k <= n <= 50). If `n` is less than or equal to `k` or `n` minus the ceiling of `n` divided by `m` is less than `k`, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'Yes' is printed.**
