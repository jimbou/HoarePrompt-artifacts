Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It accurately implements the logic to determine whether Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.

The program checks two conditions:

1. If n (the number of parts) is less than or equal to k (the number of parts Bob can repaint), it means Bob can repaint all parts to have the same color, so the program prints 'NO'.

2. If n minus the ceiling of n divided by m (the number of colors) is less than k, it means Bob can repaint the remaining parts to have the same color as the majority, so the program prints 'NO'.

If neither of these conditions is met, it means Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color, so the program prints 'Yes'.

The program correctly handles multiple test cases and prints the result for each case.

Correctness: **True**
