Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `itest` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive), `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of the next line of input from stdin, stdin contains `t-5` lines, each containing three integers n, m, and k (1 <= m, k <= n <= 50).**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `itest` remain unchanged. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to the next line of input from stdin, which contains three integers. The stdin now contains `t-5` lines, each containing three integers n, m, and k (1 <= m, k <= n <= 50).
