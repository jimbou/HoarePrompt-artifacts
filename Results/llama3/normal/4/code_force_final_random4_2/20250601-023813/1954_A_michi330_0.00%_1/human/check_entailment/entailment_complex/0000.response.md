Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Alice can paint a ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. The program reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers n, m, and k.

The program's logic is based on the condition that if n is greater than k and n minus the ceiling of n divided by m is also greater than k, then Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. This condition is implemented using the if-else statement.

The program's correctness can be verified by analyzing the condition and the problem statement. The condition checks if n is greater than k, which means that Bob cannot repaint all parts of the ribbon. Additionally, the condition checks if n minus the ceiling of n divided by m is greater than k, which means that even if Bob repaints k parts, there will still be parts with different colors.

The program's output matches the expected output for the given example inputs, which further supports its correctness.

Correctness: **True**
