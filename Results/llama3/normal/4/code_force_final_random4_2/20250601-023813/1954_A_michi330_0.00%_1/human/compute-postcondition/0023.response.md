Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `itest` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive), `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of the next line of input from stdin, stdin contains `t-5` lines, each containing three integers n, m, and k (1 <= m, k <= n <= 50). If `n` is less than or equal to `k` or `n` minus the ceiling of `n` divided by `m` is less than `k`, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'Yes' is printed.***
