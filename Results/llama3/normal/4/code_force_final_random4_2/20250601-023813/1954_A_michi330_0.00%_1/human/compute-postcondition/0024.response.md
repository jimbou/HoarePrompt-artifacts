Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `itest` is `t-1`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of the last line of input from stdin, stdin is empty. If `n` is less than or equal to `k` or `n` minus the ceiling of `n` divided by `m` is less than `k`, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'Yes' is printed.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all the iterations, and the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are the last values read from the input. The loop has finished executing, and the output is either 'NO' or 'Yes' based on the conditions in the loop body. The input stream is empty, indicating that all input lines have been processed.
