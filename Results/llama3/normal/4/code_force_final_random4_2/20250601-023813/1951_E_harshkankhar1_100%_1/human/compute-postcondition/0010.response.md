To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 2, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n`. If `n` is less than 2, the loop will not execute.

Before the loop starts, `x` is -1, but this does not affect the execution of the loop. `func_1(s[0:])` being True also does not affect the execution of the loop.

So, for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2, and `i` is now 1.

State: **`s` is a string of lowercase Latin characters, `n` is at least 2, `x` is -1, `func_1(s[0:])` is True, `i` is 1**
