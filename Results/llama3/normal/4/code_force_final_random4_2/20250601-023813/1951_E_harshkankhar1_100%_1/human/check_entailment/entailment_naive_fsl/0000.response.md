Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when the input string has a length of 2 and is not a palindrome. In this case, the program should print "YES" and partition the string into two parts, but it does not.

For example, if the input is "ab", the program should print "YES", 2, and "a b", but it does not. This is because the program checks if the first character is the same as the last character, and if not, it checks if the rest of the string is a palindrome. If the rest of the string is not a palindrome, it prints "NO". However, in this case, the rest of the string is only one character, so it is always a palindrome, and the program prints "NO" incorrectly.

To fix this, the program should add a special case for strings of length 2 that are not palindromes.
