Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem where a string of lowercase Latin characters needs to be partitioned into substrings such that each substring is not a palindrome. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` checks if a given string is a palindrome, and `func_2` attempts to partition the input string according to the problem's requirements.

Upon analyzing the code, it appears that `func_2` correctly handles the different cases outlined in the problem description. If the input string is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" and the original string. If the string consists of the same character repeated throughout, it prints "NO". If the string contains different characters, it attempts to split the string into two substrings at the index of the first different character. If this split results in a non-palindromic substring, it prints "YES" and the split substrings. If the index of the first different character is 1 or half the length of the string, it prints "NO".

However, there is a subtle issue with the program. In the case where the string contains different characters, but the index of the first different character is not 1 or half the length of the string, the program splits the string into two substrings at index `x + 2`. This is incorrect, as it does not guarantee that the resulting substrings are non-palindromic. A counterexample can be constructed by considering a string like "abba", where the first different character is at index 1, but splitting the string at index 3 results in the palindromic substring "bb".

Therefore, the program is not entirely correct, and there are cases where it may produce incorrect output.

Correctness: **False**
