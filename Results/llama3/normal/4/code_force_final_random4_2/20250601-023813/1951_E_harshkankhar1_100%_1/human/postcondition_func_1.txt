This function takes a string of lowercase Latin characters as input and checks if it meets certain conditions. If the string does not meet the conditions, it prints 'YES' and the number 1, followed by the original string. If the string meets the conditions but does not contain any characters different from the first character, it prints 'NO'. If the string meets the conditions and contains characters different from the first character, it prints 'YES' and the number 2, followed by the string split into two substrings at the index of the first different character. If the index of the first different character is 1 or half the length of the string, it prints 'NO' instead. The function does not return any value.
