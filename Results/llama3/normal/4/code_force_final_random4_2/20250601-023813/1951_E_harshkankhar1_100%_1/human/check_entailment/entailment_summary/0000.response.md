Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of partitioning a string into substrings such that each substring is not a palindrome. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` checks if a given string is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse. This function is used by `func_2` to determine if a substring is a palindrome.

`func_2` takes a string as input and checks if it meets certain conditions. If the string is not a palindrome, it prints 'YES' and the number 1, followed by the original string. If the string is a palindrome but contains characters different from the first character, it prints 'YES' and the number 2, followed by the string split into two substrings at the index of the first different character. If the index of the first different character is 1 or half the length of the string, it prints 'NO' instead.

The program's logic is correct, and it meets the problem description. The use of `func_1` to check for palindromes is efficient, and the conditions checked by `func_2` cover all possible cases. The program's output format also matches the problem description.

However, there is a small issue with the program. In the case where the string is a palindrome and contains characters different from the first character, the program prints 'YES' and the number 2, followed by the string split into two substrings at the index of the first different character. However, this partition may not always result in non-palindromic substrings. For example, if the input string is "abba", the program will print 'YES' and the number 2, followed by the substrings "ab" and "ba", which are both palindromes.

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to ensure that the partitioned substrings are always non-palindromic. One possible solution is to split the string into three substrings instead of two, using the index of the first different character and the index of the second different character.

Correctness: **False**
