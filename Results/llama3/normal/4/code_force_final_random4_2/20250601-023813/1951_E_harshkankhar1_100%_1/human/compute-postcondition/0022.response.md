Based on the initial state, the code will print the string 'NO'. The value of `x` is -1, indicating that there is no character in `s` that is different from the first character of `s`. The value of `i` is `n-1`, which is the last index of the string `s`. The function `func_1(s[0:])` is True, but it does not affect the output of the print statement.

Output: **NO**
