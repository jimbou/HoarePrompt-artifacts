Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of partitioning a string into substrings that are not palindromes. The program uses two functions: `func_1` checks if a string is a palindrome, and `func_2` attempts to partition the input string into non-palindromic substrings.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. `func_1` is a simple function that checks if a string is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse. This function is correct.

2. `func_2` is the main function that attempts to partition the input string into non-palindromic substrings. It first checks if the entire string is not a palindrome. If it's not, it prints "YES" and the string itself as the partition.

3. If the entire string is a palindrome, it then checks for the first character that is different from the first character of the string. If no such character is found, it means all characters in the string are the same, and it prints "NO" because there's no way to partition the string into non-palindromic substrings.

4. If a different character is found, it then checks if the substring after that character is not a palindrome. If it's not, it prints "YES" and partitions the string into two substrings: the substring up to and including the different character, and the substring after that character.

5. If the substring after the different character is a palindrome, it then checks if the different character is at the second position or at the middle of the string. If it is, it prints "NO" because there's no way to partition the string into non-palindromic substrings.

6. If the different character is not at the second position or at the middle of the string, it prints "YES" and partitions the string into two substrings: the substring up to and including the next character after the different character, and the substring after that character.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct output for each case.

Correctness: **True**
