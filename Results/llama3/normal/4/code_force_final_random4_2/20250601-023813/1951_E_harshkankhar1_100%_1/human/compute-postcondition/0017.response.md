The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`s` is a string of lowercase Latin characters, `n` is greater than 3, `func_1(s[0:])` is True. If the character at index `i` (which is 3) in `s` is different from the first character in `s`, then `i` is 3 and `x` is 3. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
