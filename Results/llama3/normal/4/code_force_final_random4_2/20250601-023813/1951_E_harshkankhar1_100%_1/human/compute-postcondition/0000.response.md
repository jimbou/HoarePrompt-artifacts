Output State: **s is a string of lowercase Latin characters, n is the length of s, x is -1**

The first line assigns the input string to `s`, which is a string of lowercase Latin characters. The second line assigns the length of `s` to `n` and -1 to `x`. Since `s` is a string of lowercase Latin characters, its length is a positive integer. Therefore, `n` becomes a positive integer equal to the length of `s`. The value of `x` is not affected by the first line, so it remains -1.
