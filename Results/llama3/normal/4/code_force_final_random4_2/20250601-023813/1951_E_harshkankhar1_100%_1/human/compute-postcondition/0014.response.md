To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Since `n` is at least 2, it must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables `s`, `func_1(s[0:])`, and `x` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`s` is a string of lowercase Latin characters, `n` is at least 3, `func_1(s[0:])` is True, `i` is 2, `x` is either -1 or 1 depending on the value of `s[2]`**
