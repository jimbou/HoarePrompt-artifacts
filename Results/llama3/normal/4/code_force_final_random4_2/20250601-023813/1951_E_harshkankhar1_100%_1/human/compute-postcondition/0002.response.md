Based on the initial state, the code snippet, and the task, I will determine what will be printed when the statement executes.

The initial state describes the following variables and their values:

* `s` is a string of lowercase Latin characters.
* `n` is the length of `s`.
* `x` is -1.
* The current value of `func_1(s[0:])` is False.

The code snippet contains a single `print` statement:

```
print('YES')
```

This statement simply prints the string 'YES' to the console.

Since there are no variables or expressions being evaluated in the `print` statement, the output will be a fixed string.

Output: **YES**
