The code prints a string `s` sliced into two parts, separated by a space. The first part is from the beginning of the string to the index `x + 2`, and the second part is from the index `x + 2` to the end of the string.

Since `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from the first character of `s`, and `x` is not equal to -1, it means that there is at least one character in `s` that is different from the first character.

The value of `x` is not 1, which means that the first two characters of `s` are the same. Also, `x` is not `n // 2`, which means that the string `s` has more than two characters.

The function `func_1(s[0:])` is True, which means that the string `s` satisfies some condition defined by the function `func_1`. Similarly, `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is True, which means that the substring of `s` starting from the index `x + 1` also satisfies the same condition.

Output: **s[:x + 2] (which is the substring of s from the beginning to the index x + 2), s[x + 2:] (which is the substring of s from the index x + 2 to the end)**
