Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of partitioning a string into substrings such that each substring is not a palindrome. The program uses two functions: `func_1` checks if a string is a palindrome, and `func_2` attempts to partition the string into non-palindromic substrings.

The program correctly handles the case where the input string is already non-palindromic, printing "YES" and the original string. It also correctly handles the case where the input string consists of a single repeated character, printing "NO".

The program's logic for partitioning the string into non-palindromic substrings is also correct. It finds the first character that is different from the first character of the string and attempts to split the string at that point. If the resulting substrings are not palindromes, it prints "YES" and the partitioned substrings. If the resulting substrings are palindromes, it checks if the split point is at the middle of the string or if the string has only two characters. If either condition is true, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it splits the string at the next character and prints the resulting substrings.

However, there is a subtle issue with the program's logic. When the program splits the string at the next character, it assumes that the resulting substrings will not be palindromes. However, this assumption is not always true. For example, if the input string is "abba", the program will split it into "abb" and "a", which are both palindromes. In this case, the program should print "NO", but it will incorrectly print "YES" and the partitioned substrings.

Therefore, the program is not entirely correct.

Correctness: **False**
