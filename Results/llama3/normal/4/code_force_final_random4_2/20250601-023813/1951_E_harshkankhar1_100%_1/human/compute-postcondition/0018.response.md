Output State: **s is a string of lowercase Latin characters, n is greater than 3, func_1(s[0:]) is True, x is 3, i is 3.**

In this output state, the values of `s`, `n`, and `func_1(s[0:])` remain unchanged from the initial state, as the code snippet does not modify them. The variable `x` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 3, and `i` itself is also 3, as specified in the initial state.
