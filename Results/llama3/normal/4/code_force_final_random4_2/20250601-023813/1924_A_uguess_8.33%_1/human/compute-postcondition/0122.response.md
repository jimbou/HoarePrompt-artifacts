Postcondition: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), s is an empty string, ss is undefined, cur_ss is undefined, cnt is the number of times the string s can be divided into substrings of length k where each substring contains all k distinct characters, cur is 0, tmp is an empty string, ans is a string of length cnt consisting of the character that is k-1 positions after 'a' in the alphabet, stdin contains 0 test cases. The current value of cur does not have the i-th bit set (i.e., the i-th bit of cur is 0).**
