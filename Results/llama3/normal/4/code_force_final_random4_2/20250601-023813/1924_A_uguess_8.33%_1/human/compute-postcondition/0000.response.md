Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of a line containing three integers n (1 <= n <= 26), k (1 <= k <= 26), and m (1 <= m <= 1000), followed by a line containing a string s of length m, comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first integer input from stdin, which is between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive). The remaining input in stdin consists of `t` test cases, each containing three integers and a string, as described in the initial state.
