State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is 2, stdin contains 0 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), s is an empty string, ss is undefined, cur_ss is undefined, cnt is the number of times the loop executed, and cur is 0. If cnt is greater than or equal to n, 'YES' is being printed. Otherwise, i is k, tmp is either an empty string or a character between 'a' and 'z' (inclusive), and ans is a string of 'a' + k - 1 repeated cnt times, followed by tmp, and then 'a' repeated n - cnt - 1 times, and 'NO' is being printed, and ans is printed.**
