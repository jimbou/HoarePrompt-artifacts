Output: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is k, n is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), s is an empty string, ss is undefined, cur_ss is undefined, cnt is the number of times the string s can be divided into substrings of length k where each substring contains all k distinct characters, cur is 0, tmp is the character that is k-1 positions after 'a' in the alphabet, ans is a string of length cnt + n - cnt - 1 consisting of the character that is k-1 positions after 'a' in the alphabet repeated cnt times followed by 'a' repeated n - cnt - 1 times, stdin contains 0 test cases, and this is printed: a string of length cnt + n - cnt - 1 consisting of the character that is k-1 positions after 'a' in the alphabet repeated cnt times followed by 'a' repeated n - cnt - 1 times**
