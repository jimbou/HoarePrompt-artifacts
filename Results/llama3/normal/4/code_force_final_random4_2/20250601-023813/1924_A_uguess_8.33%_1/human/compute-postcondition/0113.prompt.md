Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is 2, n is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), s is a string, cnt is 0, cur is 0, ss is undefined, cur_ss is undefined, stdin contains 0 test cases.
Code of the loop:
for ss in s:
    cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
    if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
        cur += 1 << cur_ss
    if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
        cnt += 1
        cur = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `ss` is the first character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the first character of `s` in the alphabet (0-indexed), stdin contains 0 test cases. If `cur` equals (1 shifted to the left by `k` places) minus 1, then `cnt` is 1 and `cur` is 0. Otherwise, the values of `cnt` and `cur` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `s` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `ss` is the second character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the second character of `s` in the alphabet (0-indexed), stdin contains 0 test cases. If `cur` equals 2 to the power of `k` minus 1, then `cnt` is increased by 1, `cur` is reset to 0. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `ss`, `cur_ss`, `cnt`, and `cur` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `s` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, `ss` is the third character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the third character of `s` in the alphabet (0-indexed), stdin contains 0 test cases. If the bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` is 0, then `cur` is set to 2 to the power of `cur_ss`. If `cur` is equal to 2 to the power of `k` minus 1, then `cnt` is set to 1 and `cur` is set to 0. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
