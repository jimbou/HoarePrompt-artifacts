To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `k`. The loop will execute if `k` is at least 1. Since `i` is initially 0, it should be adjusted to be within the range of `k`. Therefore, `i` should be less than `k`.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is less than `k`, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `cnt` is the number of times the string `s` contains all `k` lowercase English alphabets, `cur` is 0 if `s` contains all `k` lowercase English alphabets, otherwise `cur` is the bitwise OR of all characters in `s`, and `cnt` is less than `n`, 'NO' is printed, `tmp` is an empty string, `ans` is a string of length `cnt` consisting of the character 'a' + `k` - 1 repeated `cnt` times, `k` is at least 1**
