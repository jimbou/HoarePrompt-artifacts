Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length at least 2 comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `cnt` is 1 if `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise `cnt` remains unchanged, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and `k-1` (inclusive) equal to the position of the second character in the English alphabet, `ss` is the second character in `s`, and `cur` is 0 if `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise `cur` remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `cur_ss` has been updated to be equal to the position of the second character in the English alphabet, which is calculated by subtracting the ASCII value of 'a' from the ASCII value of the second character in the string `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.
