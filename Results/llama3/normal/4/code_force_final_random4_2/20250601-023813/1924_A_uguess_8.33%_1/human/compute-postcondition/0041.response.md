Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is equal to k, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), s is a string of length m comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, cnt is the number of times the string s contains all k lowercase English alphabets, cur is 0 if s contains all k lowercase English alphabets, otherwise cur is the bitwise OR of all characters in s, and cnt is less than n, 'NO' is printed. If the i-th bit of cur is 0, then tmp is the character corresponding to the i-th bit, otherwise no action is taken. ans is a string of length cnt consisting of the character 'a' + k - 1 repeated cnt times, and k is at least 1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop variable `i` has reached the value of `k`, which means the loop has completed all its iterations. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and conditions. The loop has iterated over all the bits of the `cur` variable, checking for the presence of each character in the string `s`. If a bit is 0, the corresponding character is stored in the `tmp` variable. The `ans` string remains unchanged, consisting of the character 'a' + `k` - 1 repeated `cnt` times.
