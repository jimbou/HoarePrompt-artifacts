The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 0 or k, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 test cases. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is either 1 or k + 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than `i`. Also, stdin contains t-2 test cases.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is either 1 or k + 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `cnt` is the number of times the string `s` contains all `k` lowercase English alphabets, `cur` is 0 if `s` contains all `k` lowercase English alphabets, otherwise `cur` is the bitwise OR of all characters in `s`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, `ans` is a string of length `n` consisting of the character 'a' + `k` - 1 repeated `cnt` times, followed by `tmp`, and then 'a' repeated `n` - `cnt` - 1 times, and `ans` is printed.**
