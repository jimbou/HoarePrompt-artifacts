Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `s` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `ss` is the second character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the second character of `s` in the alphabet (0-indexed), stdin contains 0 test cases, `cnt` remains unchanged, `cur` is increased by 2 to the power of `cur_ss`.**

In this output state, all variables remain unchanged except for `cur`, which is increased by 2 to the power of `cur_ss`. The value of `cur_ss` is the position of the second character of `s` in the alphabet (0-indexed), so the increase in `cur` depends on the second character of `s`.
