To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `ss` and `s`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `s` is just a string, but it needs to be adjusted to ensure it has at least 1 character. Also, `ss` is undefined, but it will take the value of the first character in the string `s` at the start of the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0, `ss` is the first character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is undefined, stdin contains 0 test cases**
