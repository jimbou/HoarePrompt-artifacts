Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `s` is an empty string, `ss` is undefined, `cur_ss` is undefined, `cnt` is the number of times the string `s` can be divided into substrings of length `k` where each substring contains all `k` distinct characters, `cur` is 0, `tmp` is the character 'a', `ans` is a string of length `cnt` consisting of the character that is `k-1` positions after 'a' in the alphabet, stdin contains 0 test cases.**

In this output state, the only variable that has changed is `tmp`, which is now assigned the value of the character 'a' (since `i` is 0). The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on their values are still valid.
