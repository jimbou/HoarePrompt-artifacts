Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of a line containing three integers n (1 <= n <= 26), k (1 <= k <= 26), and m (1 <= m <= 1000), followed by a line containing a string s of length m, comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, k, m = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    cnt = 0
    cur = 0
    for ss in s:
        cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
        if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
            cur += 1 << cur_ss
        if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
            cnt += 1
            cur = 0
    if cnt >= n:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
        tmp = ''
        ans = chr(ord('a') + k - 1) * cnt
        for i in range(k):
            if cur & 1 << i == 0:
                tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
        ans += tmp
        ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is either 0 or k, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), s is a string of length m comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, cnt is the number of times the string s contains all k lowercase English alphabets, cur is 0 if s contains all k lowercase English alphabets, otherwise cur is the bitwise OR of all characters in s. If cnt is greater than or equal to n, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, ans is a string of length n consisting of the character 'a' + k - 1 repeated cnt times, followed by tmp, and then 'a' repeated n - cnt - 1 times, and ans is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is either 1 or k + 1, stdin contains 0 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), s is an empty string, ss is undefined, cur_ss is undefined, cnt is the number of times the loop executed, and cur is 0. If cnt is greater than or equal to n, 'YES' is being printed. Otherwise, i is k, tmp is either an empty string or a character between 'a' and 'z' (inclusive), and ans is a string of 'a' + k - 1 repeated cnt times, followed by tmp, and then 'a' repeated n - cnt - 1 times, and 'NO' is being printed, and ans is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is either 2 or `k`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `s` is an empty string, `ss` is undefined, `cur_ss` is undefined, `cnt` is the number of times the string `s` can be divided into substrings of length `k` where each substring contains all `k` distinct characters, `cur` is 0, stdin contains 0 test cases. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, a string of length `cnt + n - cnt - 1` consisting of the character that is `k-1` positions after 'a' in the alphabet repeated `cnt` times followed by 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
