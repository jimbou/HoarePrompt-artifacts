Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is either 1 or k + 1, stdin contains t-4 test cases if cur is equal to (1 << k) - 1, otherwise stdin contains t-3 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), s is a string of length m-1 comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets that must have at least 1 character, ss is the second character in the string s, cur_ss is the integer value of the second character in the string s minus the integer value of 'a', cnt is 2 if cur is equal to (1 << k) - 1, otherwise cnt is 1, cur is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `cur` has been reset to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
