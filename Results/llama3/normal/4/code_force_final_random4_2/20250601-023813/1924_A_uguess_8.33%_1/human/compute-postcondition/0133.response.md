The `print(ans)` statement will print the string `ans`, which is a string of length `cnt + n - cnt - 1` consisting of the character that is `k-1` positions after 'a' in the alphabet repeated `cnt` times followed by 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times.

Since `cnt` is the number of times the string `s` can be divided into substrings of length `k` where each substring contains all `k` distinct characters, and `s` is an empty string, `cnt` is 0.

The character that is `k-1` positions after 'a' in the alphabet is `tmp`, which is undefined in the initial state. However, based on the description, `tmp` is the character that is `k-1` positions after 'a' in the alphabet, so it can be any character between 'b' and 'z' (inclusive), depending on the value of `k`.

Therefore, the string `ans` will consist of `cnt` (0) repetitions of `tmp` followed by `n - cnt - 1` (n-1) repetitions of 'a'.

Output: **a string of length n-1 consisting of 'a' repeated n-1 times**
