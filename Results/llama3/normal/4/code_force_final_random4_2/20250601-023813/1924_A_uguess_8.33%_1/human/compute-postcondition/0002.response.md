Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), s is a string of length m comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, cnt is 0, cur is 0**

The code reads the first test case from stdin, parsing three integers n, k, and m, and a string s. The values of n, k, and m are within their specified ranges, and s consists of the first k lowercase English alphabets. The variables cnt and cur are initialized to 0. The variable i remains unchanged at 0. The variable t is not modified, but since one test case has been read, there are now t-1 test cases remaining in stdin.
