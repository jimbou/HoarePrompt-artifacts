Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), s is a string of length at least 1 comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, cnt is 1, cur_ss is an integer between 0 and k-1 (inclusive), ss is the first character in s, and cur is 0.**

The code increments the value of `cnt` by 1, making it equal to 1. It then resets the value of `cur` to 0, which was previously equal to (1 << k) - 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
