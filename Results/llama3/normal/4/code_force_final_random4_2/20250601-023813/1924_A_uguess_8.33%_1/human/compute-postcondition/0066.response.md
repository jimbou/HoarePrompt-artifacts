Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is either 1 or k + 1, n is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), s is a string of length m-1 comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets that must have at least 2 characters, ss is the third character in the string s, cur_ss is the integer value of the third character in the string s minus the integer value of 'a', which is equal to the integer value of the third character in the string s minus 97, cnt is 2 if cur is equal to (1 << k) - 1, otherwise cnt is the original value of cnt plus 1, cur is 0, and stdin contains t-4 test cases if cur is equal to (1 << k) - 1, otherwise stdin contains t-3 test cases.**

The code increments the value of `cnt` by 1, regardless of the initial value of `cnt`. It then resets the value of `cur` to 0. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `ss`, and `cur_ss` remain unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 1 if `cur` is equal to (1 << k) - 1, and by 1 otherwise.
