The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and k, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If k is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, k is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive) ensures that the loop will execute , so it does not need to be adjusted. But i is 2 and the loop will start from 0, so it needs to be adjusted to 0. 
State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), s is an empty string, ss is undefined, cur_ss is undefined, cnt is the number of times the string s can be divided into substrings of length k where each substring contains all k distinct characters, cur is 0, tmp is an empty string, ans is a string of length cnt consisting of the character that is k-1 positions after 'a' in the alphabet, stdin contains 0 test cases.**
