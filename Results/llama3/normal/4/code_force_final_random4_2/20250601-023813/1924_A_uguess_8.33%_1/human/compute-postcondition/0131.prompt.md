Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is 2, n is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), s is an empty string, ss is undefined, cur_ss is undefined, cnt is the number of times the string s can be divided into substrings of length k where each substring contains all k distinct characters, cur is 0, tmp is an empty string, ans is a string of length cnt consisting of the character that is k-1 positions after 'a' in the alphabet, stdin contains 0 test cases.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if cur & 1 << i == 0:
        tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), s is an empty string, ss is undefined, cur_ss is undefined, cnt is the number of times the string s can be divided into substrings of length k where each substring contains all k distinct characters, cur is 0, tmp is the character 'a', ans is a string of length cnt consisting of the character that is k-1 positions after 'a' in the alphabet, stdin contains 0 test cases

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 26 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `s` is an empty string, `ss` is undefined, `cur_ss` is undefined, `cnt` is the number of times the string `s` can be divided into substrings of length `k` where each substring contains all `k` distinct characters, `cur` is 0, `tmp` is either the character 'a' or 'b', `ans` is a string of length `cnt` consisting of the character that is `k-1` positions after 'a' in the alphabet, stdin contains 0 test cases

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 26 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `s` is an empty string, `ss` is undefined, `cur_ss` is undefined, `cnt` is the number of times the string `s` can be divided into substrings of length `k` where each substring contains all `k` distinct characters, `cur` is 0, `tmp` is either 'c' if `cur` is not a power of 2, otherwise `tmp` is either 'a' or 'b', `ans` is a string of length `cnt` consisting of the character that is `k-1` positions after 'a' in the alphabet, stdin contains 0 test cases




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
