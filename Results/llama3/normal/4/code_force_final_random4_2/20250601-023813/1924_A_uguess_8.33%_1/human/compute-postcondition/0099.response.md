Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is 2, n is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), s is a string that must have at least 1 character, cnt is 1, ss is the first character in the string s, cur_ss is the position of the first character of s in the alphabet (0-indexed), stdin contains 0 test cases, cur is 0.**

The code increments the value of `cnt` by 1, making it 1, and then assigns 0 to `cur`, overwriting its previous value. No other variables are affected by the code.
