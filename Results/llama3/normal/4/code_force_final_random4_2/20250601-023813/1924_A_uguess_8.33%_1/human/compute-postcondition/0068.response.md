Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is either 1 or k + 1, stdin contains 0 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), s is an empty string, ss is undefined, cur_ss is undefined, cnt is the number of times the loop executed, cur is 0.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the variables in the loop head and body have been updated accordingly. The loop counter `t` remains unchanged, `i` is still either 1 or `k + 1`, and `n`, `k`, and `m` are still within their respective ranges. The string `s` is now empty, and `ss` and `cur_ss` are undefined since the loop has finished executing. The counter `cnt` has been incremented to reflect the number of times the loop executed, and `cur` is 0 since the loop has finished executing.
