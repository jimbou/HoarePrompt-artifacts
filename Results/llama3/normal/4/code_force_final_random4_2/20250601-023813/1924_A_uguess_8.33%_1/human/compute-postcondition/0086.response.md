Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is `k`, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `s` is an empty string, `ss` is undefined, `cur_ss` is undefined, `cnt` is the number of times the loop executed, `cur` is 0, `tmp` is either an empty string or a character between 'a' and 'z' (inclusive), `ans` is a string of 'a' + k - 1 repeated cnt times, and 'NO' is being printed, stdin contains 0 test cases. If the current value of `cur` has a bit at position `i` that is 0, then `tmp` is a character between 'a' and 'z' (inclusive). Otherwise, `tmp` is either an empty string or a character between 'a' and 'z' (inclusive).**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the values of variables not affected by the loop head and body remain unchanged. The loop counter `i` has reached the value of `k`, which is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive). The value of `tmp` depends on the bit at position `i` in the current value of `cur`. If the bit is 0, `tmp` is a character between 'a' and 'z' (inclusive). Otherwise, `tmp` is either an empty string or a character between 'a' and 'z' (inclusive).
