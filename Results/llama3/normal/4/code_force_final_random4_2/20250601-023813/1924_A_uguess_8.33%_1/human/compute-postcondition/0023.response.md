Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), s is a string of length m comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, cnt is the number of times the string s contains all k lowercase English alphabets, cur is 0 if s contains all k lowercase English alphabets, otherwise cur is the bitwise OR of all characters in s.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `cnt` will hold the number of times the string `s` contains all `k` lowercase English alphabets. The variable `cur` will be 0 if `s` contains all `k` lowercase English alphabets, otherwise it will be the bitwise OR of all characters in `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.
