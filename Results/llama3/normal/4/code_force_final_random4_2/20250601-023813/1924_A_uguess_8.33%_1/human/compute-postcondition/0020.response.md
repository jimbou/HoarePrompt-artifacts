Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length at least 3 comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `ss` is the third character in `s`, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and `k-1` (inclusive) equal to the position of the third character in the English alphabet. If `cur` was previously `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cur` is 0 and `cnt` is 2. Otherwise, if `cur` has a bit set at position `cur_ss`, then `cur` and `cnt` remain unchanged. If `cur` does not have a bit set at position `cur_ss`, then `cur` is `cur + (1 << cur_ss)` and `cnt` remains unchanged.***
