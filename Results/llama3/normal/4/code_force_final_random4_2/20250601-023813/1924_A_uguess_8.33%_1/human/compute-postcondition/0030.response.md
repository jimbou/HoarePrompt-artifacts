Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), s is a string of length m comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, cnt is the number of times the string s contains all k lowercase English alphabets, cur is 0 if s contains all k lowercase English alphabets, otherwise cur is the bitwise OR of all characters in s, and cnt is less than n, 'NO' is printed, tmp is an empty string, ans is a string of length cnt consisting of the character 'a' + k - 1 repeated cnt times.**

The code executes two lines. The first line assigns an empty string to the variable tmp. The second line assigns a string of length cnt to the variable ans, where the string consists of the character 'a' + k - 1 repeated cnt times. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
