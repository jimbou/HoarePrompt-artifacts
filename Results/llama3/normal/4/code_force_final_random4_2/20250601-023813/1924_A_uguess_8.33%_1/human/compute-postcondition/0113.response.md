Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `s` is an empty string, `ss` is undefined, `cur_ss` is undefined, `cnt` is the number of times the string `s` can be divided into substrings of length `k` where each substring contains all `k` distinct characters, `cur` is 0, stdin contains 0 test cases.**

This output state indicates that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The string `s` is now empty, and the variables `ss` and `cur_ss` are undefined since they were only used within the loop. The variable `cnt` now holds the count of the number of times the string `s` can be divided into substrings of length `k` where each substring contains all `k` distinct characters. The variable `cur` is reset to 0.
