Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to check if all possible strings of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of the given string s. 

The program uses a bitmask to keep track of the characters it has seen so far in the string s. It iterates over the string s and for each character, it checks if the corresponding bit in the bitmask is set. If not, it sets the bit and checks if the bitmask is now equal to (1 << k) - 1, which means it has seen all k distinct characters. If it has, it increments the count of divisions and resets the bitmask.

If the count of divisions is greater than or equal to n, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' and constructs a string of length n that does not occur as a subsequence of s. The string is constructed by repeating the character that is k-1 positions after 'a' in the alphabet cnt times, followed by 'a' repeated n-cnt-1 times.

The program correctly handles the edge cases and the logic is sound.

Correctness: **True**
