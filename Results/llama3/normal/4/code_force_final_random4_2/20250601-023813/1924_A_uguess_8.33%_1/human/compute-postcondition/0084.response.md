Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `k` must be greater than 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `s` is an empty string, `ss` is undefined, `cur_ss` is undefined, `cnt` is the number of times the loop executed, `cur` is 0, `tmp` is 'c', `ans` is a string of 'a' + k - 1 repeated cnt times, and 'NO' is being printed, stdin contains 0 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `tmp` has been updated to 'c' because the ASCII value of 'a' is 97 and `i` is 2, so `ord('a') + i` equals 99, which is the ASCII value of 'c'. The ASCII value of 'c' is then converted to the character 'c' by the `chr` function. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
