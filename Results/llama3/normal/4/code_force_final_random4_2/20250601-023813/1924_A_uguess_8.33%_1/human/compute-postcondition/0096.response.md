Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 1 shifted to the left by `cur_ss` places (i.e., the bit at position `cur_ss` is now set to 1), `ss` is the first character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the first character of `s` in the alphabet (0-indexed), stdin contains 0 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `cur` has been updated by setting the bit at position `cur_ss` to 1, which is equivalent to adding 1 shifted to the left by `cur_ss` places to the original value of `cur`. The other variables remain unchanged.
