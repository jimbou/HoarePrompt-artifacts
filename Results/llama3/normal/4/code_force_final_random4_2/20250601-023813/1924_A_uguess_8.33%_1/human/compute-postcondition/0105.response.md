Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is 2, n is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), s is a string that must have at least 2 characters, ss is the second character in the string s, cur_ss is the position of the second character of s in the alphabet (0-indexed), cnt is increased by 1, cur is 0, stdin contains 0 test cases.**

In this final state, all variables retain their initial properties and ranges, with the exception of `cnt`, which has been incremented by 1, and `cur`, which has been reset to 0. The condition regarding the bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` is no longer applicable since `cur` is now 0.
