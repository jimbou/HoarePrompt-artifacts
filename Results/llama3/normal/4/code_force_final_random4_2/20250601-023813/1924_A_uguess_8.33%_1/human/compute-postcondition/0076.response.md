To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `k`. The loop will execute if `k` is at least 1. Since `i` is either 1 or `k + 1`, we need to adjust `i` to be 0 (the starting value of the range) for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `s` is an empty string, `ss` is undefined, `cur_ss` is undefined, `cnt` is the number of times the loop executed, `cur` is 0, `tmp` is an empty string, `ans` is a string of 'a' + k - 1 repeated cnt times, and 'NO' is being printed, stdin contains 0 test cases**
