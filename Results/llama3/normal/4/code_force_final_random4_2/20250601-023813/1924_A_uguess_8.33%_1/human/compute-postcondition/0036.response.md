Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is less than `k`, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `cnt` is the number of times the string `s` contains all `k` lowercase English alphabets, `cur` is 0 if `s` contains all `k` lowercase English alphabets, otherwise `cur` is the bitwise OR of all characters in `s`, and `cnt` is less than `n`, 'NO' is printed. If the `i-th` bit of `cur` is 0, then `tmp` is the character corresponding to the `i-th` bit, otherwise no action is taken. `ans` is a string of length `cnt` consisting of the character 'a' + `k` - 1 repeated `cnt` times, and `k` is at least 1, `i` is increased by 1, and `tmp` is the character 'a' + `i`**.

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that `tmp` is now assigned the character 'a' + `i`, where `i` is the current value of `i`, which is less than `k`. All other variables remain unchanged.
