Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 26 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `s` is an empty string, `ss` is undefined, `cur_ss` is undefined, `cnt` is the number of times the string `s` can be divided into substrings of length `k` where each substring contains all `k` distinct characters, `cur` is 0, `tmp` is the character 'b', `ans` is a string of length `cnt` consisting of the character that is `k-1` positions after 'a' in the alphabet, stdin contains 0 test cases**

In this output state, the only change is that `tmp` is now assigned the character 'b', which is the character that is 1 position after 'a' in the alphabet, since `i` is 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
