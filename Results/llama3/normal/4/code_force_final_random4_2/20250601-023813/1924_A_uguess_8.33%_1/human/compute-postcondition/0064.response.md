Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is either 1 or k + 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length m-1 comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets that must have at least 2 characters, `ss` is the third character in the string s, `cur_ss` is the integer value of the third character in the string s minus the integer value of 'a', which is equal to the integer value of the third character in the string s minus 97, `cur` is 1 << cur_ss, if `cur` is equal to (1 << k) - 1, then `cnt` is 2, otherwise `cnt` is 1 and stdin contains t-4 test cases if `cnt` is 2, otherwise stdin contains t-3 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `ss`, and `cur_ss` remain unchanged. The value of `cur` is updated to 1 << cur_ss, which is equivalent to 2 to the power of the integer value of the third character in the string s minus 97. The value of `cnt` is either 1 or 2, depending on whether `cur` is equal to (1 << k) - 1 or not. The number of test cases in stdin is either t-4 or t-3, depending on the value of `cnt`.
