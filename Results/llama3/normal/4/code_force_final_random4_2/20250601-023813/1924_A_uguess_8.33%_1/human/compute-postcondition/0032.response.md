Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is less than `k`, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `cnt` is the number of times the string `s` contains all `k` lowercase English alphabets, `cur` is 0 if `s` contains all `k` lowercase English alphabets, otherwise `cur` is the bitwise OR of all characters in `s`, and `cnt` is less than `n`, 'NO' is printed, `tmp` is an empty string, `ans` is a string of length `cnt` consisting of the character 'a' + `k` - 1 repeated `cnt` times, `k` is at least 1. The current value of `cur` does not have the bit `i` set, meaning the character corresponding to the `i-th` bit is not present in the string `s`.***
