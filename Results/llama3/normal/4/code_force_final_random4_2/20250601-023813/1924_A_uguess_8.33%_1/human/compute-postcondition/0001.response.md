The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), which ensures that the loop will execute at least once. So, we need to adjust the state of `i` to be 0, since it will start from 0 in the first iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 0, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of a line containing three integers n (1 <= n <= 26), k (1 <= k <= 26), and m (1 <= m <= 1000), followed by a line containing a string s of length m, comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.**
