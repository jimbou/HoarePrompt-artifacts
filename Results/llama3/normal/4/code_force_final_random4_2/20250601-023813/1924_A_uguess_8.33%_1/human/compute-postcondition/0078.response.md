Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `s` is an empty string, `ss` is undefined, `cur_ss` is undefined, `cnt` is the number of times the loop executed, `cur` is 0, `tmp` is 'a', `ans` is a string of 'a' + k - 1 repeated cnt times, and 'NO' is being printed, stdin contains 0 test cases. The current value of `cur` has a bit at position `i` that is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `tmp` has been updated to 'a' because `i` is 0 and `ord('a')` is 97, so `ord('a') + i` equals 97 and `chr(97)` equals 'a'. The other variables remain unchanged.
