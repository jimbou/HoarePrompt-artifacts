Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length at least 1 comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `cnt` is 0, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and `k-1` (inclusive), and `ss` is the first character in `s`. The current value of `cur` is equal to (1 << k) - 1, meaning all bits from 0 to k-1 are set to 1.**
