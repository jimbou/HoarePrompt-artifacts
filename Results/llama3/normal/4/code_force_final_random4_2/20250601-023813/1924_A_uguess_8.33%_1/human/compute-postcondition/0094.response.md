Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0, `ss` is the first character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the first character of `s` in the alphabet (0-indexed), stdin contains 0 test cases**

In this output state, the value of `cur_ss` is calculated by subtracting the ASCII value of 'a' from the ASCII value of the first character of the string `s`. This gives the position of the first character of `s` in the alphabet, with 'a' being 0, 'b' being 1, and so on. The other variables remain unchanged.
