Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length at least 1 comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is an integer where the bit at position `cur_ss` is 1, and `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and `k-1` (inclusive), and `ss` is the first character in `s`.**

The value of `cur` is updated by adding 1 shifted to the left by `cur_ss` places, effectively setting the bit at position `cur_ss` to 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
