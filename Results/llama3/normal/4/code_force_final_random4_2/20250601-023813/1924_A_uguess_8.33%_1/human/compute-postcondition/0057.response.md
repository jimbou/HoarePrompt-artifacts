Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is either 1 or k + 1, stdin contains t-4 test cases if `cur` is equal to (1 << k) - 1, otherwise stdin contains t-3 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length m-1 comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets that must have at least 1 character, `ss` is the second character in the string s, `cnt` is 1 if `cur` is equal to (1 << k) - 1, otherwise `cnt` is 0, `cur_ss` is the integer value of the second character in the string s minus the integer value of 'a', `cur` is 0 if `cur` is equal to (1 << k) - 1, otherwise `cur` is the bitwise OR of all characters in s plus 1 shifted to the left by `cur_ss` places if the bitwise AND of `cur` and 1 shifted to the left by `cur_ss` places is 0, otherwise `cur` remains the bitwise OR of all characters in s.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `cur_ss` has been updated to be the integer value of the second character in the string `s` minus the integer value of 'a'. This means that `cur_ss` now holds the position of the second character in the alphabet (with 'a' being 0, 'b' being 1, and so on). The other variables remain unchanged.
