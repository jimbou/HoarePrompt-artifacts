Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is either 1 or k + 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), s is a string of length m comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, cnt is 0, cur is the bitwise OR of all characters in s.
Code of the loop:
for ss in s:
    cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
    if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
        cur += 1 << cur_ss
    if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
        cnt += 1
        cur = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is either 1 or k + 1, stdin contains t-4 test cases if `cur` is equal to (1 << k) - 1, otherwise stdin contains t-3 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length m comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets that must have at least 1 character, `ss` is the first character in the string s, `cnt` is 1 if `cur` is equal to (1 << k) - 1, otherwise `cnt` is 0, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and k-1 (inclusive), `cur` is 0 if `cur` is equal to (1 << k) - 1, otherwise `cur` is the bitwise OR of all characters in s plus 1 shifted to the left by `cur_ss` places if the bitwise AND of `cur` and 1 shifted to the left by `cur_ss` places is 0, otherwise `cur` remains the bitwise OR of all characters in s.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is either 1 or k + 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length m-1 comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets that must have at least 1 character, `ss` is the second character in the string s, `cur_ss` is the integer value of the second character in the string s minus the integer value of 'a'. If `cur` is equal to (1 << k) - 1, then `cnt` is 2, `cur` is 0 and stdin contains t-4 test cases. Otherwise, `cnt` is 1 and stdin contains t-3 test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is either 1 or k + 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length m-1 comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets that must have at least 2 characters, `ss` is the third character in the string s, `cur_ss` is the integer value of the third character in the string s minus the integer value of 'a', which is equal to the integer value of the third character in the string s minus 97. If `cur` is equal to (1 << k) - 1, then `cnt` is 2, `cur` is 0 and stdin contains t-4 test cases. Otherwise, `cnt` is the original value of cnt plus 1 and stdin contains t-3 test cases.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
