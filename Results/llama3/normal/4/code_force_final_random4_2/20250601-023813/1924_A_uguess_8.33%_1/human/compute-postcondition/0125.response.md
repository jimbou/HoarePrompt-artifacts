The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and k, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `k` must be greater than 1.
State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is 1, n is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), k is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 26 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), s is an empty string, ss is undefined, cur_ss is undefined, cnt is the number of times the string s can be divided into substrings of length k where each substring contains all k distinct characters, cur is 0, tmp is the character 'a', ans is a string of length cnt consisting of the character that is k-1 positions after 'a' in the alphabet, stdin contains 0 test cases**
