To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `ss` and `s`.

According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `s`. At the end of the previous iteration, `ss` is the first character in `s`. For the loop to execute again, `ss` should be the next character in `s`, and `s` should have at least one more character.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length at least 2 comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `cnt` is 1 if `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise `cnt` remains unchanged, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and `k-1` (inclusive), `ss` is the second character in `s`, and `cur` is 0 if `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise `cur` remains unchanged.**
