Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `s` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, `ss` is the third character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the third character of `s` in the alphabet (0-indexed), stdin contains 0 test cases. If the bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` is 0, then `cur` is set to 2 to the power of `cur_ss`. If `cur` is equal to 2 to the power of `k` minus 1, then `cnt` is set to 1 and `cur` is set to 0. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
