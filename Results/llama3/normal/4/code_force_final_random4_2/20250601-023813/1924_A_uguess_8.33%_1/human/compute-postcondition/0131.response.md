Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is k, n is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), s is an empty string, ss is undefined, cur_ss is undefined, cnt is the number of times the string s can be divided into substrings of length k where each substring contains all k distinct characters, cur is 0, tmp is the character that is k-1 positions after 'a' in the alphabet, ans is a string of length cnt consisting of the character that is k-1 positions after 'a' in the alphabet, stdin contains 0 test cases**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `i` has reached the value of `k`, which is the upper limit of the loop. The variable `tmp` has been updated to the character that is `k-1` positions after 'a' in the alphabet. The rest of the variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values.
