Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is either 1 or k + 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length m comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets that must have at least 1 character, `ss` is the first character in the string s, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is the bitwise OR of all characters in s, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and k-1 (inclusive)**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cur_ss` is calculated as the ASCII value of the first character in the string `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. This results in an integer between 0 and k-1 (inclusive), since `ss` is the first character in the string `s` and `s` only contains the first k lowercase English alphabets. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
