Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), s is a string of length at least 2 comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, ss is the second character in s, cur_ss is an integer between 0 and k-1 (inclusive) equal to the position of the second character in the English alphabet, cur is 0, and cnt is 2 if the previous value of cur was (1 << k) - 1, otherwise cnt is 1.**

The code increments the value of `cnt` by 1 and resets the value of `cur` to 0. The initial value of `cnt` was 1 if `cur` was equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise it remained unchanged. Since `cur` is now 0, `cnt` will be 1 if the previous value of `cur` was not `(1 << k) - 1`, and 2 if the previous value of `cur` was `(1 << k) - 1`. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.
