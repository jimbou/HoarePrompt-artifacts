The only variable in the loop head is variable  ss and s, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string s. If the string s has at least 1 character the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, cnt is 0, cur is the bitwise OR of all characters in s, i is either 1 or k + 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), t is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive). So for the loop to be executed  the string s must have at least 1 character and ss is the first character in the string s.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is either 1 or k + 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length m comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets that must have at least 1 character, `ss` is the first character in the string s, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is the bitwise OR of all characters in s**
