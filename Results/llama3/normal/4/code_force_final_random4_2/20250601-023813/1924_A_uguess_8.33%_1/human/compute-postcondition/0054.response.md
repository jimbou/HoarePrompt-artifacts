Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is either 1 or k + 1, stdin contains t-4 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), s is a string of length m comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets that must have at least 1 character, ss is the first character in the string s, cnt is 1, cur_ss is an integer between 0 and k-1 (inclusive), cur is 0.**

The code increments the value of `cnt` by 1, making it 1. It then resets the value of `cur` to 0. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
