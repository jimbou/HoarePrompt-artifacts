Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length at least 3 comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `ss` is the third character in `s`, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and `k-1` (inclusive) equal to the position of the third character in the English alphabet, If `cur` was previously `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cur` is 0 and `cnt` is 2. Otherwise, `cur` is `cur + (1 << cur_ss)` and `cnt` remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `ss`, and `cur_ss` remain unchanged. The value of `cur` is incremented by `1` shifted to the left by `cur_ss` places, which is equivalent to adding `2` to the power of `cur_ss`. If `cur` was previously equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then it is reset to `0` and `cnt` is set to `2`. Otherwise, `cur` is updated as described above and `cnt` remains unchanged.
