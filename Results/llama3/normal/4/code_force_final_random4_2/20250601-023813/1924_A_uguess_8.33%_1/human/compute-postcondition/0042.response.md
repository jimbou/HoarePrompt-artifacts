Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is equal to k, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), s is a string of length m comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, cnt is the number of times the string s contains all k lowercase English alphabets, cur is 0 if s contains all k lowercase English alphabets, otherwise cur is the bitwise OR of all characters in s, ans is a string of length n consisting of the character 'a' + k - 1 repeated cnt times, followed by tmp, and then 'a' repeated n - cnt - 1 times, and k is at least 1.**

In this final state, the value of `ans` has been modified by appending `tmp` and `n - cnt - 1` repetitions of 'a' to it. The length of `ans` is now `n`, which is the desired length. The value of `tmp` is the character corresponding to the `i`-th bit of `cur`, which is 0 if the `i`-th bit of `cur` is 0, and no action is taken otherwise. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.
