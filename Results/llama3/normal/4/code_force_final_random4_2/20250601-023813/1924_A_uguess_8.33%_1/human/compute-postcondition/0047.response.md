Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is either 1 or k + 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), s is a string of length m comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, cnt is 0, cur is the bitwise OR of all characters in s.**

The code block reads three integers from stdin and assigns them to `n`, `k`, and `m`, respectively. It then reads a string `s` from stdin. The values of `n`, `k`, and `m` are updated to the newly read values. The string `s` is assigned the newly read string. The variable `cnt` is initialized to 0, and the variable `cur` is initialized to the bitwise OR of all characters in `s`. The value of `t` is not affected by the code block, and `i` is not modified. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 2.
