Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `ss` is the first character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the first character of `s` in the alphabet (0-indexed), stdin contains 0 test cases. If `cur` equals (1 shifted to the left by `k` places) minus 1, then `cnt` is 1 and `cur` is 0. Otherwise, the values of `cnt` and `cur` remain unchanged.***
