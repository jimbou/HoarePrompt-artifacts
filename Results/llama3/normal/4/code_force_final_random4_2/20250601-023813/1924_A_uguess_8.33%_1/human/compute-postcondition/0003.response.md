To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `ss` and `s`. The loop will execute if `s` has at least one character. Since `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, we can adjust the state of `s` to have at least one character. Additionally, `ss` is an iteration variable that takes on the value of each character in `s`, so we can adjust its state to be the first character in `s`.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length at least 1 comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0, `ss` is the first character in `s`**
