Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is either 1 or k + 1, stdin contains 0 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), s is an empty string, ss is undefined, cur_ss is undefined, cnt is the number of times the loop executed, cur is 0, tmp is an empty string, ans is a string of 'a' + k - 1 repeated cnt times, and 'NO' is being printed.**

The code assigns an empty string to `tmp` and a string of `cnt` repetitions of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` to `ans`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
