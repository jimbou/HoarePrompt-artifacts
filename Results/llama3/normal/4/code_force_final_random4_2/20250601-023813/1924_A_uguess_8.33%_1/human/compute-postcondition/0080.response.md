The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `k` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `k` must be greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `s` is an empty string, `ss` is undefined, `cur_ss` is undefined, `cnt` is the number of times the loop executed, `cur` is 0, `tmp` is either an empty string or 'a', `ans` is a string of 'a' + k - 1 repeated cnt times, and 'NO' is being printed, stdin contains 0 test cases. The current value of `cur` has a bit at position `i` that is either 0 or 1.**
