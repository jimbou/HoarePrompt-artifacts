Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to check if all possible strings of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of the given string s.

Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. The program correctly reads the input and initializes the necessary variables.
2. It uses a bitwise approach to keep track of the characters in the string s that have been seen so far. This is done using the `cur` variable, which is a bitmask where each bit corresponds to a character in the alphabet.
3. The program iterates through the string s and updates the `cur` bitmask accordingly. If a character is seen for the first time, the corresponding bit in the `cur` bitmask is set.
4. If the `cur` bitmask becomes equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, it means that all k distinct characters have been seen, and the `cnt` variable is incremented.
5. After iterating through the entire string s, the program checks if `cnt` is greater than or equal to n. If it is, it prints 'YES', indicating that all possible strings of length n can be formed as a subsequence of s.
6. If `cnt` is less than n, the program constructs a string of length n that cannot be formed as a subsequence of s. This is done by repeating the character that is k-1 positions after 'a' in the alphabet `cnt` times, followed by 'a' repeated `n-cnt-1` times.

The program correctly handles all edge cases and produces the expected output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
