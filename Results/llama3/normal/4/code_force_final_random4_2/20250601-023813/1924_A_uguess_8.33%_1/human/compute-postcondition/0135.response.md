Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is either 2 or `k`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `s` is an empty string, `ss` is undefined, `cur_ss` is undefined, `cnt` is the number of times the string `s` can be divided into substrings of length `k` where each substring contains all `k` distinct characters, `cur` is 0, stdin contains 0 test cases. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, a string of length `cnt + n - cnt - 1` consisting of the character that is `k-1` positions after 'a' in the alphabet repeated `cnt` times followed by 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times is printed.**
