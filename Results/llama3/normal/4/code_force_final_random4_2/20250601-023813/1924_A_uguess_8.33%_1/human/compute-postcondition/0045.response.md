Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is either 0 or k, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), s is a string of length m comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, cnt is the number of times the string s contains all k lowercase English alphabets, cur is 0 if s contains all k lowercase English alphabets, otherwise cur is the bitwise OR of all characters in s. If cnt is greater than or equal to n, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, ans is a string of length n consisting of the character 'a' + k - 1 repeated cnt times, followed by tmp, and then 'a' repeated n - cnt - 1 times, and ans is printed.**
