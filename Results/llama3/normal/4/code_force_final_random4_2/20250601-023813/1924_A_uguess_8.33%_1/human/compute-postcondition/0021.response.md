Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), s is a string of length at least 3 comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, ss is the third character in s, cur_ss is an integer between 0 and k-1 (inclusive) equal to the position of the third character in the English alphabet, cur is 0, cnt is an integer greater than its original value by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1 due to the first line of the code. The second line resets the value of `cur` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.
