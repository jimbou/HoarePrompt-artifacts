Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length at least 2 comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `ss` is the second character in `s`, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and `k-1` (inclusive) equal to the position of the second character in the English alphabet, `cur` is either 0 or `1 << cur_ss` if `cur` was previously `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise `cur` is `(1 << cur_ss) + previous value of cur`, `cnt` is 1 if `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise `cnt` remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows: The value of `cur` is updated by adding `1 << cur_ss` to its previous value, but if `cur` was previously `(1 << k) - 1`, it becomes 0. The value of `cnt` is updated to 1 if `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise it remains unchanged. All other variables remain unchanged.
