Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `k` must be greater than 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `s` is an empty string, `ss` is undefined, `cur_ss` is undefined, `cnt` is the number of times the loop executed, `cur` is 0, `ans` is a string of 'a' + k - 1 repeated cnt times, and 'NO' is being printed, stdin contains 0 test cases. If the current value of `cur` has a bit at position `i` that is 0, then `tmp` is 'c'. Otherwise, `tmp` is either an empty string or 'b'.***
