Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `s` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, `ss` is the third character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the third character of `s` in the alphabet (0-indexed), stdin contains 0 test cases, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 2 to the power of `cur_ss`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `ss`, `cur_ss`, stdin and `cnt` remains the same as in the initial state. However, the value of `cur` is now 2 to the power of `cur_ss`, where `cur_ss` is the position of the third character of `s` in the alphabet (0-indexed).
