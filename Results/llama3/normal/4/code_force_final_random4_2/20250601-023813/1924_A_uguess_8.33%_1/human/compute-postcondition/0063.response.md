Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is either 1 or k + 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length m-1 comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets that must have at least 2 characters, `ss` is the third character in the string s, `cur_ss` is the integer value of the third character in the string s minus the integer value of 'a', which is equal to the integer value of the third character in the string s minus 97. If `cur` is equal to (1 << k) - 1, then `cnt` is 2, `cur` is 0 and stdin contains t-4 test cases. Otherwise, `cnt` is 1 and stdin contains t-3 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only change being that `cur_ss` is now equal to the integer value of the third character in the string `s` minus the integer value of 'a', which is 97. All other variables and conditions remain the same.
