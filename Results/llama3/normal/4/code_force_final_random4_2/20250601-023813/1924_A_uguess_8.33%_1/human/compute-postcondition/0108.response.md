Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `s` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, `ss` is the third character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the third character of `s` in the alphabet (0-indexed), stdin contains 0 test cases, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `cur_ss` has been updated to be the position of the third character of `s` in the alphabet (0-indexed), which is calculated by subtracting the ASCII value of 'a' from the ASCII value of `ss`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
