Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `s` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `ss` is the second character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the second character of `s` in the alphabet (0-indexed), stdin contains 0 test cases. If `cur` equals 2 to the power of `k` minus 1, then `cnt` is increased by 1, `cur` is reset to 0. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `ss`, `cur_ss`, `cnt`, and `cur` remain unchanged.***
