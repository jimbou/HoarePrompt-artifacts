Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is 2, n is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), s is a string, cnt is 0, cur is 0, ss is undefined, cur_ss is undefined, stdin contains 0 test cases.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The initial state of the program has been modified by the code. The values of `n`, `k`, and `m` have been updated to the integer values read from the input. The string `s` has been assigned the value of the second input. The variables `cnt` and `cur` have been initialized to 0. The variables `ss` and `cur_ss` remain undefined. The value of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. Stdin is empty, containing 0 test cases.
