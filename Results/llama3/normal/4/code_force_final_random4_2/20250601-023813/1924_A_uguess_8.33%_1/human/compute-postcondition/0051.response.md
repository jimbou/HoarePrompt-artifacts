Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is either 1 or k + 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length m comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets that must have at least 1 character, `ss` is the first character in the string s, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is the bitwise OR of all characters in s plus 1 shifted to the left by `cur_ss` places, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and k-1 (inclusive).**

In this output state, the value of `cur` has been updated by adding 1 shifted to the left by `cur_ss` places. This means that the bit at the position corresponding to `cur_ss` in `cur` is now set. The other variables remain unchanged.
