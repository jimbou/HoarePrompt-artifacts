Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers (n, k, m) and a string s. It then checks if the string s can be divided into substrings of length k, where each substring contains all k distinct characters. If the number of such divisions is greater than or equal to n, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints a string of length n-1, consisting of the character that is k-1 positions after 'a' in the alphabet repeated cnt times (where cnt is the number of divisions), followed by 'a' repeated n-cnt-1 times. The function processes all test cases and prints the corresponding results.**
