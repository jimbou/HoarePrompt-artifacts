To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `ss` and `s`.

According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `s`. At the end of the previous iteration, `ss` is the second character in the string `s`, and `s` has at least 1 character.

For the loop to execute again, `s` must have at least 2 characters, and `ss` must be the third character in the string `s`. 

Additionally, since `cur_ss` is the integer value of the second character in the string `s` minus the integer value of 'a', we need to update `cur_ss` to be the integer value of the third character in the string `s` minus the integer value of 'a'.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is either 1 or k + 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length m-1 comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets that must have at least 2 characters, `ss` is the third character in the string s, `cur_ss` is the integer value of the third character in the string s minus the integer value of 'a'. If `cur` is equal to (1 << k) - 1, then `cnt` is 2, `cur` is 0 and stdin contains t-4 test cases. Otherwise, `cnt` is 1 and stdin contains t-3 test cases.**
