Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length at least 1 comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0, `ss` is the first character in `s`, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and `k-1` (inclusive)**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` is still an integer between 1 and 10^5, `i` is still 0, there are still `t-1` test cases in `stdin`, `n` is still an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is still an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is still an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is still a string of length at least 1 comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `cnt` is still 0, `cur` is still 0, `ss` is still the first character in `s`, and a new variable `cur_ss` is introduced which is an integer between 0 and `k-1` (inclusive), representing the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a'.
