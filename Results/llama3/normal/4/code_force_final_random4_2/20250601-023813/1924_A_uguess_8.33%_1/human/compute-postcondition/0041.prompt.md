Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), s is a string of length m comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, cnt is the number of times the string s contains all k lowercase English alphabets, cur is 0 if s contains all k lowercase English alphabets, otherwise cur is the bitwise OR of all characters in s, and cnt is less than n, 'NO' is printed, tmp is an empty string, ans is a string of length cnt consisting of the character 'a' + k - 1 repeated cnt times.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if cur & 1 << i == 0:
        tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is less than `k`, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `cnt` is the number of times the string `s` contains all `k` lowercase English alphabets, `cur` is 0 if `s` contains all `k` lowercase English alphabets, otherwise `cur` is the bitwise OR of all characters in `s`, and `cnt` is less than `n`, 'NO' is printed. If the `i-th` bit of `cur` is 0, then `tmp` is the character corresponding to the `i-th` bit, otherwise no action is taken. `ans` is a string of length `cnt` consisting of the character 'a' + `k` - 1 repeated `cnt` times, and `k` is at least 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is less than `k`, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `cnt` is the number of times the string `s` contains all `k` lowercase English alphabets, `cur` is 0 if `s` contains all `k` lowercase English alphabets, otherwise `cur` is the bitwise OR of all characters in `s`, and `cnt` is less than `n`, 'NO' is printed. If the `i-th` bit of `cur` is 0, then `tmp` is the character corresponding to the `i-th` bit, otherwise no action is taken. `ans` is a string of length `cnt` consisting of the character 'a' + `k` - 1 repeated `cnt` times, and `k` is at least 1, `i` is increased by 1, and if the `i-th` bit of `cur` is 0, then `tmp` is the character 'a' + `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is increased by 1, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `cnt` is the number of times the string `s` contains all `k` lowercase English alphabets, `cur` is 0 if `s` contains all `k` lowercase English alphabets, otherwise `cur` is the bitwise OR of all characters in `s`, and `cnt` is less than `n`, 'NO' is printed. If the `i-th` bit of `cur` is 0, then `tmp` is the character corresponding to the `i-th` bit, otherwise no action is taken. `ans` is a string of length `cnt` consisting of the character 'a' + `k` - 1 repeated `cnt` times, and `k` is at least 1, `i` is less than `k`, and if the `i-th` bit of `cur` is 0, `tmp` is the character corresponding to the `i-th` bit of `cur`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
