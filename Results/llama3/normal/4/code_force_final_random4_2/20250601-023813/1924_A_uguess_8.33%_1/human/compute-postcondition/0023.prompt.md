Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), s is a string of length m comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, cnt is 0, cur is 0
Code of the loop:
for ss in s:
    cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
    if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
        cur += 1 << cur_ss
    if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
        cnt += 1
        cur = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length at least 1 comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `cnt` is 1 if `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise `cnt` remains unchanged, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and `k-1` (inclusive), `ss` is the first character in `s`, and `cur` is 0 if `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise `cur` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length at least 2 comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `ss` is the second character in `s`, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and `k-1` (inclusive) equal to the position of the second character in the English alphabet. If `cur` was previously `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cur` is 0 and `cnt` is 2. Otherwise, `cur` and `cnt` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), s is a string of length at least 3 comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, ss is the third character in s, cur_ss is an integer between 0 and k-1 (inclusive) equal to the position of the third character in the English alphabet. If cur was previously equal to (1 << k) - 1, then cur is 0 and cnt is increased by 1. Otherwise, cur and cnt remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
