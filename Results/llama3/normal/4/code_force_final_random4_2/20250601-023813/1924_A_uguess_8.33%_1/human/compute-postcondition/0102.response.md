Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `s` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `ss` is the second character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the second character of `s` in the alphabet (0-indexed), stdin contains 0 test cases, `cnt` and `cur` remain unchanged**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only change being that `cur_ss` is now assigned the position of the second character of `s` in the alphabet (0-indexed), which is calculated using the ASCII values of the characters. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
