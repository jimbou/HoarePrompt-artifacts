To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the range `4`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if the range `4` is at least 1. Since `4` is a constant, it is always greater than 0, so the loop will definitely execute. The variable `i` will take on values from 0 to 3 during the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1 and `n` currently must be greater than 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases. Each test case consists of four lines, each containing two integers `x` and `y` (-1000 <= `x`, `y` <= 1000), `coord` is an empty list, `res` is 0, `i` is 0**
