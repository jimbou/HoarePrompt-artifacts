To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states accordingly.


The loop head is `for i in range(4):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 4.


At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.


The other variables in the state (`n`, `stdin`, `coord`, and `res`) are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.


Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:


State: **`n` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2 and `n` currently must be greater than 0, `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases, `coord` is a list containing one tuple of two integers, `res` is 0, `i` is 1**
