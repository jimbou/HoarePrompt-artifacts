Output State: **n is an integer equal to its original value minus 1 and n currently must be greater than 0, stdin contains t-4 test cases. Each test case consists of four lines, each containing two integers x and y (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000), coord is a list containing four tuples of two integers, res is 0, i is 3**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of 'n' remains the same as its initial value minus 1 and is still greater than 0. The input buffer 'stdin' now contains 't-4' test cases. The list 'coord' now contains four tuples of two integers each, which were read from the input buffer during the four iterations of the loop. The variable 'res' remains unchanged at 0, and the loop counter 'i' has reached its final value of 3.
