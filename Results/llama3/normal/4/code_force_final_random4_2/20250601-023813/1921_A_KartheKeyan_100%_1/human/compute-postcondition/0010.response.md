Output State: **n is an integer equal to its original value minus 1 and n currently must be greater than 0, stdin contains t-5 test cases, coord is a sorted list containing four tuples of two integers, res is the square root of the product of the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first points and the squared differences between the coordinates of the fourth and third points, i is 3**

The code first sorts the list of coordinates in ascending order. Then, it calculates the squared differences between the x and y coordinates of the second and first points (p1) and the squared differences between the x and y coordinates of the fourth and third points (p2). Finally, it calculates the square root of the product of p1 and p2 and assigns it to the variable res. The value of n remains unchanged, and the value of i remains 3. The stdin still contains t-5 test cases.
