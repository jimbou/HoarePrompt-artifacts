Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2 and n currently must be greater than -1, stdin contains t-5 test cases, coord is a sorted list containing four tuples of two integers, res is the square root of the product of the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first points and the squared differences between the coordinates of the fourth and third points, i is 3, and the rounded value of res is being printed.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been decremented by 1, so it is now equal to its original value minus 2. The other variables remain unchanged, and the precondition that `n` is greater than 0 is still valid, but now `n` is greater than -1. The stdin still contains t-5 test cases, and the values of `coord`, `res`, and `i` are unchanged. The rounded value of `res` is still being printed.
