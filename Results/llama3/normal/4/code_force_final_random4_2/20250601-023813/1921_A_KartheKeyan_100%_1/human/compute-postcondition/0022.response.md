Output State: **n is an integer equal to its original value minus 2 and n currently must be greater than 0, stdin contains t-9 test cases, coord is a list containing four tuples of two integers, res is 0, i is 3**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is: the value of n remains unchanged, stdin has two fewer test cases, the coord list now contains four pairs of integers, the value of res remains 0, and the value of i has returned to its initial value of 3.
