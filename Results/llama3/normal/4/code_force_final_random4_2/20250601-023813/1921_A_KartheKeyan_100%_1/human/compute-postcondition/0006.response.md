Output State: **n is an integer equal to its original value minus 1 and n currently must be greater than 0, stdin contains t-3 test cases, coord is a list containing two tuples of two integers, res is 0, i is 1**

The code reads two integers from the input, assigns them to the variables x and y, and appends a tuple of these integers to the list coord. Since stdin contains t-2 test cases, each consisting of four lines, the code will read two lines from the input, leaving t-3 test cases in stdin. The list coord will now contain two tuples of two integers. The variables res and i remain unchanged.
