Output State: **n is an integer equal to its original value minus 3 and n is currently greater than 0, coord is a list containing one tuple of two integers, res is 0, p1 is the squared difference of the x and y coordinates of the first and second tuples in the original coord, p2 is the squared difference of the x and y coordinates of the third and fourth tuples in the original coord, i will take values from 0 to 3, stdin contains t-11 test cases.**

The code reads a line from stdin, which contains two integers separated by a space, and assigns them to the variables x and y. These values are then appended to the coord list as a tuple. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The value of n is still an integer equal to its original value minus 3 and is greater than 0. The value of res is still 0. The values of p1 and p2 are still the squared differences of the x and y coordinates of the first and second tuples, and the third and fourth tuples, respectively, in the original coord. The value of i will still take values from 0 to 3. The stdin now contains t-11 test cases.
