Output State: **n is an integer equal to its original value minus 1 and n currently must be greater than 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case consists of four lines, each containing two integers x and y (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000), coord is a list containing one tuple of two integers, res is 0, i is 0**

The code reads a line from stdin, which contains two integers x and y. These values are assigned to the variables x and y, respectively. The tuple (x, y) is then appended to the coord list. The values of n, res, and i remain unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 1.
