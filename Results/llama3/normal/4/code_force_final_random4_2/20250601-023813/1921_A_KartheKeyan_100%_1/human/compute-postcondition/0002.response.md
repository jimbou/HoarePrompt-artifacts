Output State: **n is an integer equal to its original value minus 1 and n currently must be greater than 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of four lines, each containing two integers x and y (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000), coord is an empty list, res is 0**

The code initializes two variables, `coord` and `res`, to an empty list and 0, respectively. The initial state of `n` and the contents of `stdin` remain unchanged, as the code does not modify them. The final state includes the new variables `coord` and `res` with their assigned values, while the state of `n` and `stdin` remains the same as in the initial state.
