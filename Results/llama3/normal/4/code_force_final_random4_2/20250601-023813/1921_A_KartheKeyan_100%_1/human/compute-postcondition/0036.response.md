Output State: **n is an integer equal to its original value minus 3 and n is currently greater than 0, coord is a sorted list containing four tuples of two integers, res is the square root of the product of the squared differences of the x and y coordinates of the first and second tuples and the third and fourth tuples in the sorted coord, p1 is the squared difference of the x and y coordinates of the first and second tuples in the sorted coord, p2 is the squared difference of the x and y coordinates of the third and fourth tuples in the sorted coord, i is 3, stdin contains t-14 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The `coord` list is sorted in ascending order based on the tuples it contains. The `res` variable is calculated as the square root of the product of the squared differences of the x and y coordinates of the first and second tuples and the third and fourth tuples in the sorted `coord`. The `p1` and `p2` variables are updated to represent the squared differences of the x and y coordinates of the first and second tuples and the third and fourth tuples in the sorted `coord`, respectively. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The number of test cases in stdin remains the same, t-14.
