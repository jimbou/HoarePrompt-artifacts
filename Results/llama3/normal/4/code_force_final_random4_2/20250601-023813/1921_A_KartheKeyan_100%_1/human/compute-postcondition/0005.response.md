The only variable in the loop head is variable i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i. If i is less than 4, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is 0, and for the loop to execute again i must be 1.
State: **n is an integer equal to its original value minus 1 and n currently must be greater than 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case consists of four lines, each containing two integers x and y (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000), coord is a list containing one tuple of two integers, res is 0, i is 1**
