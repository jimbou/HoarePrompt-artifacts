Output State: **n is an integer equal to its original value minus 2 and n currently must be greater than 0, stdin contains t-6 test cases, coord is a list containing one tuple of two integers, res is 0, i is 0**

The code block reads a line from stdin, which contains two integers separated by a space, and assigns them to the variables x and y. These values are then appended to the coord list as a tuple. Since stdin initially contained t-5 test cases, it now contains t-6 test cases after reading one line. The values of n, res, and i remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
