To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and the range `4`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the range `4`. If `i` is less than `4`, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is 3, which ensures that the loop will execute. However, we need to adjust the state of `i` to reflect that it will take on values from 0 to 3 during the loop execution. The range `4` is a constant and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3 and `n` is currently greater than 0, `coord` is an empty list, `res` is 0, `p1` is the squared difference of the x and y coordinates of the first and second tuples in the original `coord`, `p2` is the squared difference of the x and y coordinates of the third and fourth tuples in the original `coord`, `i` will take values from 0 to 3, `stdin` contains `t-10` test cases, and the rounded value of the original `res` is printed**
