Output State: **n is an integer equal to its original value minus 3 and n is currently greater than 0, coord is a list containing three tuples of two integers, res is 0, p1 is the squared difference of the x and y coordinates of the first and second tuples in the original coord, p2 is the squared difference of the x and y coordinates of the third and fourth tuples in the original coord, i is 2, stdin contains t-13 test cases.**

The code reads two integers from the input and appends them as a tuple to the coord list. The value of n, res, p1, p2, and i remains unchanged. The coord list now contains three tuples of two integers. The stdin now contains t-13 test cases.
