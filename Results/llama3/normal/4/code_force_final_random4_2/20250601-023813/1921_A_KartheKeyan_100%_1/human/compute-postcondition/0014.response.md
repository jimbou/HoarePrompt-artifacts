The only variable in the loop head is variable n, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable n.  If n is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is an integer equal to its original value minus 2 and n currently must be greater than -1. n being greater than -1 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to n currently must be greater than 0.
State: **`n` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2 and n currently must be greater than 0, stdin contains t-5 test cases, coord is a sorted list containing four tuples of two integers, res is the square root of the product of the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first points and the squared differences between the coordinates of the fourth and third points, i is 3, and the rounded value of res is being printed.**
