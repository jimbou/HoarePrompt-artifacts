To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and the range `4`.

Since the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range `4`, we can adjust the state of `i` to be within this range. The range `4` means the loop will iterate from `0` to `3`. Therefore, we can adjust the state of `i` to be `0`, which is the starting point of the range.

The other variables in the state, such as `n`, `stdin`, `coord`, `res`, and the original value of `n`, are not relevant to the loop execution and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2 and n currently must be greater than 0, `stdin` contains t-5 test cases, `coord` is an empty list, `res` is 0, `i` is 0**
