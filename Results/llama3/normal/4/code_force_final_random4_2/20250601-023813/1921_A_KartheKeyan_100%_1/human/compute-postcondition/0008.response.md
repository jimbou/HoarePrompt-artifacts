Output State: **n is an integer equal to its original value minus 1 and n currently must be greater than 0, stdin contains t-4 test cases, coord is a list containing three tuples of two integers, res is 0, i is 2**

The code block reads a pair of integers from stdin and appends them as a tuple to the coord list. Since stdin contains t-3 test cases initially, after reading one pair of integers, it will be left with t-4 test cases. The coord list initially contains two tuples of two integers, and after appending the new pair, it will contain three tuples of two integers. The values of n, res, and i remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
