Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of four lines, each containing two integers x and y (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000).
Code of the loop:
while n:
    coord = []
    res = 0
    for i in range(4):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        coord.append((x, y))
    coord = sorted(coord)
    p1 = (coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) ** 2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1]) ** 2
    p2 = (coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]) ** 2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1]) ** 2
    res = math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2)
    print(round(res))
    n -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2 and n currently must be greater than -1, stdin contains t-5 test cases, coord is a sorted list containing four tuples of two integers, res is the square root of the product of the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first points and the squared differences between the coordinates of the fourth and third points, i is 3, and the rounded value of res is being printed.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3 and `n` is currently greater than -1, `coord` is a sorted list containing four tuples of two integers, `res` is the square root of the product of the squared differences of the x and y coordinates of the first and second tuples and the third and fourth tuples in `coord`, `p1` is the squared difference of the x and y coordinates of the first and second tuples in `coord`, `p2` is the squared difference of the x and y coordinates of the third and fourth tuples in `coord`, `i` is 3, stdin contains t-10 test cases, and the rounded value of `res` is printed.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is an integer equal to its original value minus 4 and `n` is currently greater than -1, `coord` is a sorted list containing four tuples of two integers, `res` is the square root of the product of the squared differences of the x and y coordinates of the first and second tuples and the third and fourth tuples in the sorted `coord`, `p1` is the squared difference of the x and y coordinates of the first and second tuples in the sorted `coord`, `p2` is the squared difference of the x and y coordinates of the third and fourth tuples in the sorted `coord`, `i` is 3, stdin contains t-15 test cases, and the rounded value of `res` is being printed.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
