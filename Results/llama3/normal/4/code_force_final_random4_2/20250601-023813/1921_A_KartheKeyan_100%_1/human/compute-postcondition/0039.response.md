Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to its original value minus 4 and `n` is currently greater than -1, `coord` is a sorted list containing four tuples of two integers, `res` is the square root of the product of the squared differences of the x and y coordinates of the first and second tuples and the third and fourth tuples in the sorted `coord`, `p1` is the squared difference of the x and y coordinates of the first and second tuples in the sorted `coord`, `p2` is the squared difference of the x and y coordinates of the third and fourth tuples in the sorted `coord`, `i` is 3, stdin contains t-15 test cases, and the rounded value of `res` is being printed.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been decremented by 1, so it is now equal to its original value minus 4. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains t-15 test cases. The rounded value of `res` is still being printed.
