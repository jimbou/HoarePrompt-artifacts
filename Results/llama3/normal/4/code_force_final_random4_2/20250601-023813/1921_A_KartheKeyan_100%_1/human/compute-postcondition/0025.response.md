The code prints the rounded value of `res`, which is the square root of the product of `p1` and `p2`. Where `p1` is the squared difference of the x and y coordinates of the first and second tuples in `coord`, and `p2` is the squared difference of the x and y coordinates of the third and fourth tuples in `coord`.

Output: **n is an integer equal to its original value minus 2 and n currently must be greater than 0, coord is a sorted list containing four tuples of two integers, res is the square root of the product of the squared differences of the x and y coordinates of the first and second tuples and the third and fourth tuples in coord, p1 is the squared difference of the x and y coordinates of the first and second tuples in coord, p2 is the squared difference of the x and y coordinates of the third and fourth tuples in coord, i is 3, stdin contains t-9 test cases, and the rounded value of res is printed**
