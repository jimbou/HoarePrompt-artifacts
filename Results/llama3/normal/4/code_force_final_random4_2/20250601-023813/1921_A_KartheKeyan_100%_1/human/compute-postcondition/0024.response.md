The code prints the rounded value of `res`, which is the square root of the product of the squared differences of the x and y coordinates of the first and second tuples and the third and fourth tuples in `coord`.

Since `p1` is the squared difference of the x and y coordinates of the first and second tuples in `coord`, and `p2` is the squared difference of the x and y coordinates of the third and fourth tuples in `coord`, we can express `res` as the square root of the product of `p1` and `p2`.

However, the exact values of `p1` and `p2` are not provided, so we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `res`. Nevertheless, we can describe the output as the rounded value of the square root of the product of the squared differences of the x and y coordinates of the first and second tuples and the third and fourth tuples in `coord`.

Output: **the rounded square root of the product of the squared differences of the x and y coordinates of the first and second tuples and the third and fourth tuples in coord**
