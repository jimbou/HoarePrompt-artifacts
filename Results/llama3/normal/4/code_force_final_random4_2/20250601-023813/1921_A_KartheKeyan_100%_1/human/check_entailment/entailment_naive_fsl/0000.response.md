Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input coordinates are not in the order of (x1, y1), (x1, y2), (x2, y1), (x2, y2) or (x1, y1), (x2, y1), (x1, y2), (x2, y2). 

For example, if the input is:

1 2
1 5
4 2
4 5

The program will not work correctly because it assumes that the first two points are on the same side of the square, which is not the case here.

The correct approach would be to find the two points with the same x-coordinate and the two points with the same y-coordinate, and then calculate the distance between them to find the side length of the square. 

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    n = int(input())
    while n:
        coord = []
        for i in range(4):
            (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
            coord.append((x, y))
        x_coords = [x for x, y in coord]
        y_coords = [y for x, y in coord]
        x_side = max(x_coords) - min(x_coords)
        y_side = max(y_coords) - min(y_coords)
        res = x_side * y_side
        print(res)
        n -= 1
```

This program first separates the x and y coordinates, then finds the maximum and minimum of each to calculate the side lengths of the square.
