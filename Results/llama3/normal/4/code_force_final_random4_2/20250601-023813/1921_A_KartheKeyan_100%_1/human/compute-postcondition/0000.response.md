Output State: **n is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of four lines, each containing two integers x and y (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000).**

The code reads an integer `n` from stdin, which represents the number of test cases. The while loop runs `n` times. In each iteration, it reads an integer `l` from stdin and calculates a value `s` based on `l`. The value of `s` is then printed. After each iteration, `n` is decremented by 1. 

Since the code only reads and processes the first test case, the remaining `t-1` test cases are still in stdin. The value of `n` is decremented by 1 after processing the first test case.
