Output State: **n is an integer equal to its original value minus 3 and n is currently greater than 0, coord is a list containing four tuples of two integers, res is 0, p1 is the squared difference of the x and y coordinates of the first and second tuples in the original coord, p2 is the squared difference of the x and y coordinates of the third and fourth tuples in the original coord, i is 3, stdin contains t-14 test cases.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all 4 iterations, and the variables have been updated accordingly. The list 'coord' now contains four tuples of two integers, which were input during the four iterations of the loop. The variable 'i' has taken values from 0 to 3, and the other variables remain unchanged.
