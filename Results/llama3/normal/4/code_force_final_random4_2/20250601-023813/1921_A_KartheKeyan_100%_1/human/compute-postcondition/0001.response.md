The only variable in the loop head is variable n, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable n.  If n is not equal to 0, the loop can execute . Rigtht before the loop, n is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, So for the loop to  executed the first time time the original value of n needed to have been equal or greater than 1 and n currently must be greater than 0.
State: **n is an integer equal to its original value minus 1 and n currently must be greater than 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of four lines, each containing two integers x and y (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000).**
