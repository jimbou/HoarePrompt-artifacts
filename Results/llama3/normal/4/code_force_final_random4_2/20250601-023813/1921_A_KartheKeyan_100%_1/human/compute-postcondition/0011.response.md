The code prints the rounded value of `res`, which is the square root of the product of the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first points and the squared differences between the coordinates of the fourth and third points in the `coord` list.

Since `coord` is a sorted list containing four tuples of two integers, we can denote the coordinates as follows:

- First point: `(x1, y1)`
- Second point: `(x2, y2)`
- Third point: `(x3, y3)`
- Fourth point: `(x4, y4)`

The squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first points are `(x2 - x1)^2` and `(y2 - y1)^2`. Similarly, the squared differences between the coordinates of the fourth and third points are `(x4 - x3)^2` and `(y4 - y3)^2`.

The product of these squared differences is `((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2) * ((x4 - x3)^2 + (y4 - y3)^2)`.

The square root of this product is `sqrt(((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2) * ((x4 - x3)^2 + (y4 - y3)^2))`, which is the value of `res`.

The `round` function rounds this value to the nearest integer.

Output: **the rounded square root of the product of the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first points and the squared differences between the coordinates of the fourth and third points in the coord list**
