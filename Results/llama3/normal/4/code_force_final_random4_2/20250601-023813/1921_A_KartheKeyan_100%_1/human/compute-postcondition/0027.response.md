According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3 and `n` is currently greater than -1. `n` being greater than -1 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0.
State: **`n` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3 and `n` is currently greater than 0, `coord` is a sorted list containing four tuples of two integers, `res` is the square root of the product of the squared differences of the x and y coordinates of the first and second tuples and the third and fourth tuples in `coord`, `p1` is the squared difference of the x and y coordinates of the first and second tuples in `coord`, `p2` is the squared difference of the x and y coordinates of the third and fourth tuples in `coord`, `i` is 3, stdin contains t-10 test cases, and the rounded value of `res` is printed.**
