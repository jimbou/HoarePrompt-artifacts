Output State: **a is a list of four integers, cnt is 0, x is the fourth element in a, and cnt is printed**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns a list of four integers from stdin to `a`. This means that `a` is now a list of four integers, and stdin is empty. The second line assigns 0 to `cnt`. This means that `cnt` is now 0, regardless of its previous value.

The initial state mentioned that `cnt` is either 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, plus the integer division of the third element in `a` by 2, plus the integer division of the fourth element in `a` by 2. However, since the code assigns 0 to `cnt`, this information is no longer relevant.

The initial state also mentioned that `x` is the fourth element in `a`. This information is still valid, as the code does not modify `x`.

Finally, the initial state mentioned that `cnt` is printed. This is still true, as the code does not modify the fact that `cnt` is printed.

Therefore, the final output state is that `a` is a list of four integers, `cnt` is 0, `x` is the fourth element in `a`, and `cnt` is printed.
