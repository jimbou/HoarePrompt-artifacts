The only variable in the loop head is variable  x and list a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list a.  If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, a has at least 2 elements, x is the second element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the x is the third element in the list.
State: **`cnt` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5, `a` is a list of four integers that must have at least 3 elements, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), x is the third element in the list**
