According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `a` has at least 4 integers, `x` is the first element in `a`, `cnt` is increased by the integer part of `x` divided by 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the `x` is the second element in the list.
State: **`a` is a list of at least three integers, `x` is the second element in `a`, `cnt` is increased by the integer part of `x` divided by 2**
