Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = 0
    if a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1:
        cnt += 1
    for x in a:
        cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
    print(cnt)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cnt` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 or 7 or 8 or 9 or 10 or 11 or 12 or 13 or 14 or 15 or 16 or 17 or 18 or 19 or 20, `a` is a list of four integers that must have at least 4 elements, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), x is the fourth element in the list, and the value of cnt which is either 0 or 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 or 7 or 8 or 9 or 10 or 11 or 12 or 13 or 14 or 15 or 16 or 17 or 18 or 19 or 20 is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: cnt is either 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, plus the integer division of the third element in a by 2, plus the integer division of the fourth element in a by 2, a is a list of four integers, x is the fourth element in a, and cnt is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of at least four integers, `x` is the fourth element in `a`, `cnt` is increased by the integer part of each element in `a` divided by 2, and the value of `cnt` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
