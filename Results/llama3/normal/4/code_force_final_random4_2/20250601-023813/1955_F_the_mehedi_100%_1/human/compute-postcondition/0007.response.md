The only variables in the loop head are variables  x and a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. If `a` has at least 2 elements the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` has at least 1 element, x is the first element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the x is the second element in the list.
State: **`cnt` is either 0 or 1 or 2, `a` is a list of four integers that must have at least 2 elements, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), x is the second element in the list.**
