To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The objects involved are `_` (which is a throwaway variable and doesn't affect the state), `int(input())`, and `stdin` (which is implicit).

At the end of the previous iteration, `cnt` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 or 7 or 8 or 9 or 10 or 11 or 12 or 13 or 14 or 15 or 16 or 17 or 18 or 19 or 20, `a` is a list of four integers that must have at least 4 elements, `stdin` contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), `x` is the fourth element in the list, and the value of `cnt` which is either 0 or 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 or 7 or 8 or 9 or 10 or 11 or 12 or 13 or 14 or 15 or 16 or 17 or 18 or 19 or 20 is being printed.

For the loop to execute one more time, the state of `stdin` needs to be adjusted. Specifically, `stdin` must contain at least one more line, so that `int(input())` can read another value.

State: **`cnt` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 or 7 or 8 or 9 or 10 or 11 or 12 or 13 or 14 or 15 or 16 or 17 or 18 or 19 or 20, `a` is a list of four integers that must have at least 4 elements, `stdin` contains t lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), `x` is the fourth element in the list**
