Output State: **`cnt` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5, `a` is a list of four integers that must have at least 2 elements, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), x is the second element in the list.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been updated by adding the integer division of `x` by 2, where `x` is the second element in the list `a`. The value of `cnt` can now be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, depending on the value of `x`. The other variables, `a` and stdin, remain unchanged.
