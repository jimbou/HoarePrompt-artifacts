To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and the expression `int(input())`. The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` is greater than 0.

State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), _ is 0, int(input()) must be greater than 0**
