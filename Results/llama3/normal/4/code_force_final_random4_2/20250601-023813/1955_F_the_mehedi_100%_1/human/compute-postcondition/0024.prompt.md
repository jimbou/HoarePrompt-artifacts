Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *cnt is either 0 or 1, a is a list of four integers, x is the fourth element in the list. If the first three elements of the list are all odd, then cnt is set to 1. Otherwise, cnt remains 0.
Code of the loop:
for x in a:
    cnt += math.floor(x / 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cnt` is either 0, 1, or 2, `a` is a list of four integers that must have at least one element, `x` is one of the elements in `a`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cnt` is either 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, `a` is a list of four integers that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is one of the elements in `a`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cnt` is either 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, plus the integer division of the third element in `a` by 2, `a` is a list of four integers that must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in `a`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
