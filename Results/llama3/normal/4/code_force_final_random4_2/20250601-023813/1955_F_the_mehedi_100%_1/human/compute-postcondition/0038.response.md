The `print(cnt)` statement will print the total count of the integer parts of all elements in the list `a` divided by 2.

Since `cnt` is increased by the integer part of each element in `a` divided by 2, we can describe its value as the sum of the integer parts of all elements in `a` divided by 2.

Output: **the sum of the integer parts of all elements in list a divided by 2**
