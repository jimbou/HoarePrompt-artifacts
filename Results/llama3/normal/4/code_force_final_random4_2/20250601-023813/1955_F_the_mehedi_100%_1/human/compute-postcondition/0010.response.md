Output State: **`cnt` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 or 7 or 8 or 9 or 10 or 11 or 12 or 13 or 14 or 15, `a` is a list of four integers that must have at least 3 elements, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), x is the third element in the list**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been increased by the integer division of `x` by 2, where `x` is the third element in the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200).
