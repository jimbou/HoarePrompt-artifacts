Output State: **cnt is 0, a is a list of four integers, x is the fourth element in the list**

The code first assigns a list of four integers from stdin to `a`, replacing its previous value. Since `a` must have at least 4 elements, this operation is valid. The second line assigns 0 to `cnt`, overwriting its previous value. The value of `x` remains unchanged as the fourth element in the list `a`. Stdin now contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200).
