Output State: **`a` is a list of four integers, `cnt` is 1, `x` is the fourth element in `a`, and `cnt` is printed**.

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables, `a` and `x`, remain unchanged. The fact that `cnt` is printed is still true, as the code does not affect this aspect.
