Output State: **stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), a is a list of four integers, cnt is 0**

The first line assigns a list of four integers from stdin to `a`. Stdin now contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200). The second line initializes `cnt` to 0. No other variables are affected.
