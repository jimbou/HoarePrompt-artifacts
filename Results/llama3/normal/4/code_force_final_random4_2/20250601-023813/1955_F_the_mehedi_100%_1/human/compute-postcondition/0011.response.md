Output State: **`cnt` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 or 7 or 8 or 9 or 10 or 11 or 12 or 13 or 14 or 15 or 16 or 17 or 18 or 19 or 20, `a` is a list of four integers that must have at least 4 elements, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), x is the fourth element in the list.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `cnt` can take on any value from 0 to 20, `a` is a list of four integers with at least four elements, and the state of stdin remains unchanged. The value of `x` is the fourth element in the list `a`.
