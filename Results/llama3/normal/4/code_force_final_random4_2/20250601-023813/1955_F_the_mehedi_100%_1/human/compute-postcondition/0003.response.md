Output State: **`cnt` is 1, `a` is a list of four integers where `a[0]`, `a[1]`, `a[2]` are odd numbers, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200)**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The list `a` still contains four integers, and the first three elements `a[0]`, `a[1]`, `a[2]` are still odd numbers. The stdin still contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200).
