The only objects in the loop head are variables  x and list  a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list a.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, a has at least 1 element, x is one of the elements in a. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the x is one of the elements in a.
State: **`cnt` is either 0, 1, or 2, `a` is a list of four integers that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is one of the elements in `a`**
