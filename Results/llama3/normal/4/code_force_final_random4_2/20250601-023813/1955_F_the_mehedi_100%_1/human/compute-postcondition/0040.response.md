Output State: **cnt is either 0 or 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 or 7 or 8 or 9 or 10 or 11 or 12 or 13 or 14 or 15 or 16 or 17 or 18 or 19 or 20, a is a list of four integers that must have at least 4 elements, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), x is the fourth element in the list, and the value of cnt which is either 0 or 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 or 7 or 8 or 9 or 10 or 11 or 12 or 13 or 14 or 15 or 16 or 17 or 18 or 19 or 20 is being printed**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the output state after the loop executes 1 time. This is because the loop iterates over the input lines, and after the first iteration, the state of the variables does not change. The value of `cnt` is printed after each iteration, and the value of `a` remains a list of four integers. The state of `stdin` also remains the same, containing `t-1` lines, each with four integers. The value of `x` is still the fourth element in the list.
