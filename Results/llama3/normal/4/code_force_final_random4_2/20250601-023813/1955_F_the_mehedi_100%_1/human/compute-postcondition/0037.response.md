Output State: **`a` is a list of at least four integers, `x` is the fourth element in `a`, `cnt` is increased by the integer part of each element in `a` divided by 2**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `a` remains unchanged, the variable `x` now holds the value of the fourth element in `a`, and the variable `cnt` has been incremented by the integer part of each element in `a` divided by 2.
