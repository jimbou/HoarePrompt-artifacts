Output State: **`cnt` is either 0 or 1 or 2, `a` is a list of four integers that must have at least 1 element, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), x is the first element in the list. If `a[0]`, `a[1]`, `a[2]` are all odd numbers, then `cnt` is 1 or 2. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0 or 1.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been updated based on the value of `x`, which is the first element in the list `a`. If `x` is even, `cnt` remains the same (either 0 or 1). If `x` is odd, `cnt` is incremented by 1 (either 0 becomes 1 or 1 becomes 2). The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
