The only variable in the loop head is variable `x` and list `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `cnt` is either 0 or 1 and `a` is a list of four integers and stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200). If `a[0]`, `a[1]`, `a[2]` are all odd numbers, then `cnt` is 1. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 element and the x is the first element in the list.
State: **`cnt` is either 0 or 1, `a` is a list of four integers that must have at least 1 element, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), x is the first element in the list. If `a[0]`, `a[1]`, `a[2]` are all odd numbers, then `cnt` is 1. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0.**
