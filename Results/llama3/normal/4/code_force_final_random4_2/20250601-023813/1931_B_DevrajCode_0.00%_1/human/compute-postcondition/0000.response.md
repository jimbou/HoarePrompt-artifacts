Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of non-negative integers, `total_water` is the sum of `a` which is divisible by `n`, and 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and the sum of `a` does not exceed 2 * 10^9.**

In this output state, the value of `total_water` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, which is also divisible by `n`. The other variables, `n` and `a`, remain unchanged. The constraints on `n` and the sum of `a` are still valid.
