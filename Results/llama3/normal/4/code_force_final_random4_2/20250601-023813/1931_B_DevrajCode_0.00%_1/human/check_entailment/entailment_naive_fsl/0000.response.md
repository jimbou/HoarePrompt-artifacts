Correctness: **True**

The program correctly determines whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. The key insight is that the sum of the water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers, which means that the target amount of water in each container is an integer.

The program first calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by the number of containers. If it is not, it immediately returns 'No'. Otherwise, it calculates the target amount of water in each container and iterates through the containers, keeping track of the cumulative difference between the actual amount of water and the target amount.

If at any point the cumulative difference becomes negative, it means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to fill the current container to the target amount, so the program returns 'No'. If the program finishes iterating through all containers without returning 'No', it means that it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same, so it returns 'Yes'.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where the number of containers is 1 or where the amount of water in each container is already equal to the target amount. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
