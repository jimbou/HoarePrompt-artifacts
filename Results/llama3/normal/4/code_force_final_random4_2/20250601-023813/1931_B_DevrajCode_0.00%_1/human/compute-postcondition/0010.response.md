To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the given state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for water in a:`, which means we can only adjust the state of `water` and `a`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `a`. If `a` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `a` has at least 1 element, and `water` is the first element in the list. For the loop to execute again, `a` must have at least 2 elements, and `water` must be the second element in the list.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, `total_water` is the sum of `a` which is divisible by `n`, `target` is an integer equal to `total_water` divided by `n`, `container` is `a[1] - total_water / n`, `water` is the second element in the list, and `container` is greater than or equal to 0**
