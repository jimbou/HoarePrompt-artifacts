Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program first checks if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers. If it's not, the program returns 'No' because it's impossible to distribute the water evenly. This check is correct because the problem statement guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`.

2.  The program then calculates the target amount of water each container should have, which is the total amount of water divided by the number of containers.

3.  The program iterates over the amounts of water in each container. For each container, it calculates the difference between the current amount of water and the target amount. This difference is added to the `container` variable.

4.  If the `container` variable ever becomes negative, the program returns 'No'. This is correct because it means that there's not enough water in the previous containers to fill the current container to the target amount. The problem statement only allows pouring water from a container to a container with a higher index, so if the `container` variable becomes negative, it's impossible to distribute the water evenly.

5.  If the program finishes iterating over all containers without the `container` variable becoming negative, it returns 'Yes'. This is correct because it means that there's enough water in the previous containers to fill each container to the target amount.

Overall, the program correctly determines whether it's possible to distribute the water evenly among the containers according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
