Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly determines whether it is possible to distribute water among containers evenly. The program first calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by the number of containers. If not, it immediately returns 'No'. Otherwise, it calculates the target amount of water each container should have and iterates through the containers, keeping track of the difference between the current container's water level and the target level. If at any point this difference becomes negative, it means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to fill the current container to the target level, so it returns 'No'. If it finishes iterating through all containers without returning 'No', it means that it is possible to distribute the water evenly, so it returns 'Yes'.

Correctness: **True**
