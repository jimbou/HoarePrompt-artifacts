Functionality: **Determines whether it is possible to distribute water among containers evenly.**

The function accepts two parameters: a positive integer `n` and a list of non-negative integers `a`. It returns a string indicating whether the distribution is possible ('Yes') or not ('No'). 

The function calculates the total water and checks if it is divisible by `n`. If not, it immediately returns 'No'. Otherwise, it calculates the target amount of water each container should have and iterates through the list of water amounts. If at any point the cumulative difference between the actual and target amounts becomes negative, it returns 'No'. If the iteration completes without returning 'No', it returns 'Yes', indicating that the water can be distributed evenly among the containers.
