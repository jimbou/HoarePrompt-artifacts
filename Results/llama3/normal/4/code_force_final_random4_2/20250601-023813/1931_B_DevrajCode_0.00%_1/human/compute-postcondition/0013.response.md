Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 2 elements, `total_water` is the sum of `a` which is divisible by `n`, `target` is an integer equal to `total_water` divided by `n`, and `water` is the second element in the list. If `container` is less than 0, the program returns the string 'No'. Otherwise, the program continues with the current values of `n`, `a`, `total_water`, `target`, `container`, and `water`.***
