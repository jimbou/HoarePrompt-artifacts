Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of non-negative integers, `total_water` is the sum of `a` which is divisible by `n`, `target` is an integer equal to `total_water` divided by `n`, and `container` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus `n` times `target`.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed for all elements in the list `a`. The value of `container` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus `n` times `target`, where `target` is the average value of the elements in `a`. If `container` is less than 0 at any point during the loop, the program returns 'No'. Otherwise, the program continues execution until all elements in `a` have been processed.
