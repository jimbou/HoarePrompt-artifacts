The only variable in the loop head is variable water and list a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list a. If the list has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, total_water is divisible by n. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 element and the water is the first element in the list.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `total_water` is the sum of `a` which is divisible by `n`, `target` is an integer equal to `total_water` divided by `n`, `container` is 0, `water` is the first element in the list**
