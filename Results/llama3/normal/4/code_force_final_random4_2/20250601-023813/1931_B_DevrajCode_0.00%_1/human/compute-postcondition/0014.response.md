To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for water in a:`. Therefore, we can only adjust the states of `water` and `a`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list has at least one more element, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` has at least 2 elements, and `water` is the second element in the list.

For the loop to execute one more time, the list `a` must have at least 3 elements, and `water` must be the third element in the list.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 3 elements, `total_water` is the sum of `a` which is divisible by `n`, `target` is an integer equal to `total_water` divided by `n`, `container` is less than 0, and `water` is the third element in the list.**
