The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line calculates the target value by dividing `total_water` by `n`. Since `total_water` is the sum of `a` and is divisible by `n`, the result of this division is an integer. The second line initializes a variable `container` to 0.

Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of non-negative integers, total_water is the sum of a which is divisible by n, target is an integer equal to total_water divided by n, and container is 0.**
