Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first reads the input data, which includes the number of test cases (n) and the amounts of water in each container (a).

2. The function `func_1(n, a)` is defined to solve the problem. It calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by the number of containers (n). If not, it returns 'No' because it is impossible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

3. The function then calculates the target amount of water in each container by dividing the total amount of water by the number of containers (n).

4. It initializes a variable `container` to 0, which will be used to keep track of the cumulative difference between the amount of water in each container and the target amount.

5. The function then iterates over the amounts of water in each container. For each container, it adds the difference between the amount of water in the current container and the target amount to the `container` variable.

6. If the `container` variable becomes negative at any point, it means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to make the amount of water in the current container equal to the target amount. In this case, the function returns 'No'.

7. If the function completes the iteration over all containers without returning 'No', it means that it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. In this case, the function returns 'Yes'.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
