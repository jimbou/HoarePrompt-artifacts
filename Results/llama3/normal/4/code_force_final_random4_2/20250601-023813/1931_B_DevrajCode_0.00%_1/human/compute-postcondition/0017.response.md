Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 3 elements, `total_water` is the sum of `a` which is divisible by `n`, `target` is an integer equal to `total_water` divided by `n`, `container` is less than or equal to `a[2] - (total_water / n)`, and `water` is the third element in the list. If `container` is less than 0, the program returns the string 'No'. Otherwise, the program continues execution.***
