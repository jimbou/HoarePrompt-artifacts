Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, `total_water` is the sum of `a` which is divisible by `n`, `target` is an integer equal to `total_water` divided by `n`, `container` is `a[1] - total_water / n + a[1] - total_water / n`, `water` is the second element in the list, and `container` is greater than or equal to 0**

In this output state, the value of `container` has been updated to `a[1] - total_water / n + a[1] - total_water / n`, which is equivalent to `2 * a[1] - 2 * total_water / n`. The other variables remain unchanged.
