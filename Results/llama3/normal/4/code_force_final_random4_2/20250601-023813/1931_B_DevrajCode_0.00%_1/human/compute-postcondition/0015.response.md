Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 3 elements, `total_water` is the sum of `a` which is divisible by `n`, `target` is an integer equal to `total_water` divided by `n`, `container` is less than or equal to `a[2] - (total_water / n)`, and `water` is the third element in the list.**

In this output state, the value of `container` has been updated to be less than or equal to `a[2] - (total_water / n)`, which is the result of adding `water - target` to its initial value. The other variables remain unchanged.
