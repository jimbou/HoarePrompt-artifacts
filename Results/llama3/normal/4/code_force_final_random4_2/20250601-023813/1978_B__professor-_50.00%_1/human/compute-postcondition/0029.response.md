The code calculates and prints the value of the expression `(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2` after converting it to an integer.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. `2 * b`: This expression multiplies the value of `b` by 2.
2. `2 * b - n`: This expression subtracts the value of `n` from the result of the previous step.
3. `2 * b - n + 1`: This expression adds 1 to the result of the previous step.
4. `(2 * b - n + 1) * n`: This expression multiplies the result of the previous step by the value of `n`.
5. `(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2`: This expression divides the result of the previous step by 2.

Since `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers, and `t` is greater than 0, but `t` is not used in the expression, the output will be an integer value.

However, without knowing the exact values of `n` and `b`, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of the expression.

Output: **an integer value representing the result of the expression (2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2**
