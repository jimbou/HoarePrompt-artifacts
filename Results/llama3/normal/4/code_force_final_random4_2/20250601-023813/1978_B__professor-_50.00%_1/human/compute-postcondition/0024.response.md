Postcondition: **The program prints the product of `n` and `a` if `b` is less than or equal to `a`. If `b` is greater than `a`, the program prints the sum of an arithmetic series with 'n' terms, where the first term is 'a' and the last term is 'b', unless `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, in which case it prints `(2 * [b] - [n] + 1) * [n] / 2`.**
