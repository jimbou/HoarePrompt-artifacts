The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `t` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`_` is 1, `t` is at least 2, `n` is an integer between 0 and 10^9-1, `a` is an integer between 0 and 10^9-1, `b` is an integer between 0 and 10^9-1, stdin contains multiple test cases.**
