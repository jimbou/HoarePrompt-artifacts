Output State: **`t` is an integer larger than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9) minus one test case.**

In this output state, `t` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, which is larger than 0. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but one test case has been removed because it was used to assign the value to `t`. Each remaining test case still contains three integers n, a, and b, with the same constraints (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9).
