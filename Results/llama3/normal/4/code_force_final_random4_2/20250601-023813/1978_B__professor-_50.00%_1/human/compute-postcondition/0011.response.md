The code prints the result of a mathematical expression involving the variables `a`, `b`, and `n`. 

The expression `(b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1)` calculates the sum of an arithmetic series with `b - a + 1` terms, where the first term is `a` and the common difference is 1. This sum is then added to `a * n`.

Since `b` is greater than `a` and the difference between `b` and `a` is less than `n`, the expression `(b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1)` will always be a non-negative integer.

The value of `a * n` is the product of `a` and `n`, where `a` is an integer between 0 and 10^9-1 and `n` is an integer between 0 and 10^9-1.

Therefore, the output will be the sum of the arithmetic series and the product of `a` and `n`.

Output: **the sum of the arithmetic series with b - a + 1 terms, where the first term is a and the common difference is 1, plus the product of a and n**
