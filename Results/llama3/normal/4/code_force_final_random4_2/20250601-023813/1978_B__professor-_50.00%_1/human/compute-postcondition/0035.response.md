Output State: **`t` is 0, `_` is `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are undefined, stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the loop counter `t` has been decremented to 0, the loop variable `_` has reached its final value equal to the initial value of `t`, and the variables `n`, `a`, and `b` are no longer defined because they were only defined within the loop. Additionally, the standard input `stdin` is empty, indicating that all test cases have been processed.
