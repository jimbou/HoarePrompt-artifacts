Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 0 and 10^9-1, `a` is an integer between 0 and 10^9-1, `b` is an integer between 0 and 10^9-1, stdin contains multiple test cases, `b` is greater than `a`, and the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`.**
