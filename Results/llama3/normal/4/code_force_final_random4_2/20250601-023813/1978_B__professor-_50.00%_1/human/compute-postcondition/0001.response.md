The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer larger than 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is at least 1 and `_` is now 0.
State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9) minus one test case.**
