Output: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 0 and 10^9-1, `a` is an integer between 0 and 10^9-1, `b` is an integer between 0 and 10^9-1, stdin contains multiple test cases, `b` is greater than `a`, and the difference between `b` and `a` is less than `n`, and this is printed: the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence with first term a and common difference (b-a), which is equal to int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)**
