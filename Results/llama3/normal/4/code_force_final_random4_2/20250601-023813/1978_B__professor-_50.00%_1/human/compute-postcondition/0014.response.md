Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 0 and 10^9-1, `a` is an integer between 0 and 10^9-1, `b` is an integer between 0 and 10^9-1, stdin contains multiple test cases. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the product of `n` and `a` is printed. If `b` is greater than `a`, then if the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the value of `an + n^2/2 + n/2` is printed. Otherwise, the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence with first term a and common difference (b-a) is printed, which is equal to int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n).**
