The code prints the value of the expression `(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2`, which is an integer.
Output: ** `_` is 1, `t` is at least 2, `n` is an integer between 0 and 10^9-1, `a` is an integer between 0 and 10^9-1, `b` is an integer between 0 and 10^9-1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, and this is printed: `(2 * [b] - [n] + 1) * [n] / 2`**
