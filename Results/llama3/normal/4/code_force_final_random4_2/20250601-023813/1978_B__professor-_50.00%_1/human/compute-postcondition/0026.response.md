Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers, `t` is greater than 0, stdin contains no input**.

In this output state, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` have been updated to integers based on the input from stdin, which is now empty. The value of `t` remains greater than 0, as it was not affected by the code.
