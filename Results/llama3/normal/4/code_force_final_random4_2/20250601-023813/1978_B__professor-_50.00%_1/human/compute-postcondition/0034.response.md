Postcondition: ***`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers, `t` is greater than 0, stdin contains no input. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the product of `n` and `a` is printed. Otherwise, if `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the product of `n` and the average of `(2 * b - n + 1)` and 1 is printed. Otherwise, the sum of an arithmetic series with `n` terms, starting from `a`, with a common difference of `(b - a) / n`, is printed.***
