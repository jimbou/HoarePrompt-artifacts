Postcondition: ***`_` is 1, `t` is at least 2, `n` is an integer between 0 and 10^9-1, `a` is an integer between 0 and 10^9-1, `b` is an integer between 0 and 10^9-1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program prints `(2 * [b] - [n] + 1) * [n] / 2`. Otherwise, the program prints the sum of an arithmetic series with 'n' terms, where the first term is 'a' and the last term is 'b'.***
