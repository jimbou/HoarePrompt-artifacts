Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` is at least 2, `n` is an integer between 0 and 10^9-1, `a` is an integer between 0 and 10^9-1, `b` is an integer between 0 and 10^9-1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `_` remains 1, `t` is still at least 2, and the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the integers input from the first test case. The stdin now contains one less test case.
