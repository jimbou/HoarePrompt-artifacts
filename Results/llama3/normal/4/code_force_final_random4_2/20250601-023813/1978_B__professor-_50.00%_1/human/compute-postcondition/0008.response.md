The code prints the result of the formula `(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2`, which is an integer.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

* `2 * b`: This expression multiplies the value of `b` by 2. Since `b` is an integer between 0 and 10^9-1, the result of this expression will also be an integer.
* `- n + 1`: This expression subtracts the value of `n` from the result of the previous expression and then adds 1. Since `n` is an integer between 0 and 10^9-1, the result of this expression will also be an integer.
* `* n`: This expression multiplies the result of the previous expression by the value of `n`. Since both operands are integers, the result of this expression will also be an integer.
* `/ 2`: This expression divides the result of the previous expression by 2. Since the result of the previous expression is an integer, the result of this expression will also be an integer.

Therefore, the final result of the formula is an integer.

Output: **an integer (result of the formula (2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)**
