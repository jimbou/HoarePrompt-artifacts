Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the maximum count of a number in the list is less than k but greater than 1. In this case, the program will print n, but it is possible to exchange some cards to reduce the total number of cards.

For example, if the input is:

5 3
1 1 2 2 3

The program will print 5, but it is possible to exchange two 1s for one 1, and two 2s for one 2, resulting in a total of 3 cards.

The program only checks if the maximum count of a number is greater than or equal to k, and if so, it prints k-1. However, it does not consider the case where the maximum count is less than k but greater than 1, and it is possible to exchange some cards to reduce the total number of cards.
