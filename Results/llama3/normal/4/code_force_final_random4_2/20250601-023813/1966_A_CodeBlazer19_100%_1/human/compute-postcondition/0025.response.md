Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the minimum number of operations required to make all elements in a list unique. It accepts no parameters and returns no value. The function reads an integer t, representing the number of test cases, followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and k, and a list of n integers. The function calculates the frequency of each unique integer in the list and prints k-1 if the maximum frequency is greater than or equal to k, otherwise, it prints n. The function processes all test cases and leaves stdin empty.**
