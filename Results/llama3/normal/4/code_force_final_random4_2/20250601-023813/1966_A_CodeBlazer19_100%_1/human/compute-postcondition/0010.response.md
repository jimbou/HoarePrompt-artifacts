The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `t` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **t is at least 2, i is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, l is a list of integers, p is a list of integers representing the frequency of each unique integer in l, stdin is empty.**
