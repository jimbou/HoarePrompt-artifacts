Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program first finds the index `ans1` that has the maximum value in the permutation `p`. This is done by comparing each element with the current maximum and updating the maximum if necessary.

2. Then, it finds all indices `v` that have the same maximum value as `ans1`. This is done by comparing each element with `ans1` and adding it to the list `v` if they are equal.

3. Next, it finds the index `ans` in the list `v` that has the maximum value when XORed with `ans1`. This is done by comparing each element in `v` with the current maximum and updating the maximum if necessary.

4. Finally, it prints the pair of indices `ans` and `ans1` that have the maximum XOR value.

The program uses at most 3n queries, which is within the allowed limit. The queries are used to compare the values of different elements in the permutation, and the program uses the results of these queries to find the pair of indices with the maximum XOR value.

Correctness: **True**
