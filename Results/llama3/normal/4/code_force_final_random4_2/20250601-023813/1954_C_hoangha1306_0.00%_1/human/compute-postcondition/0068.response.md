Postcondition: **t is an integer between 2 and 1000, q is 1, stdin contains at least 2t-5 strings, a is a string of the same length and consists only of digits from 1 to 9 and has at least 2 characters, b is a string of the same length and consists only of digits from 1 to 9, i is 1, x is the minimum of the integer values of the ith character of a and b, y is the maximum of the integer values of the ith character of a and b, vt is 1. If a[i] > b[i], then kq1 is the original value of kq1 plus the string representation of x, and kq2 is the original value of kq2 plus the string representation of y. Otherwise, kq1 is the original value of kq1 plus the string representation of y, and kq2 is the original value of kq2 plus the string representation of x.**
