The code prints the string `kq2` which contains the larger of the two digits at each position where `a` and `b` differ.
Output: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000, q is 0, stdin contains at least 2t-2 strings x and y, where x and y are of the same length and consist only of digits from 1 to 9, a is an empty string, b is an empty string, kq1 and kq2 are strings consisting of the digits of the original a and b, but with the digits rearranged such that kq1 contains the smaller of the two digits at each position where a and b differ, and kq2 contains the larger of the two digits at each position where a and b differ, vt is either 0 or 1, kq1 is printed, and kq2 is printed**
