Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `q` is 0, `stdin` contains at least 2t-4 strings `x` and `y`, where `x` and `y` are of the same length and consist only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 2 digits, `b` is a string of digits from 1 to 9, `kq1` and `kq2` are strings consisting of the digits of `a` and `b` as described in the previous state, `i` is the index of the next character to be processed in `a`. If `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, then `a` has at least 2 digits, `kq1` and `kq2` are strings consisting of the digits of `a` and `b`. Otherwise, `a` has at least 3 digits, `kq1` and `kq2` are strings consisting of the digits of `a` and `b` plus the minimum and maximum of the integer values of the current characters in `a` and `b`, depending on the value of `vt`.**
