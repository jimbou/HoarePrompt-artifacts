Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 2 and 1000, q is 1, stdin contains at least 2t-4 strings x and y, a is a string of the same length and consists only of digits from 1 to 9, b is a string of the same length and consists only of digits from 1 to 9, kq1 is an empty string, kq2 is an empty string, vt is 0, kq1 is printed, and kq2 is printed
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
        kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
        continue
    else:
        x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
        if vt == 0:
            vt = 1
            if a[i] > b[i]:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
            else:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
        else:
            kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `q` is 1, `stdin` contains at least 2t-4 strings `x` and `y`, `a` is a string of the same length and consists only of digits from 1 to 9 and has at least 1 character, `b` is a string of the same length and consists only of digits from 1 to 9. If the character at index `i` of string `a` is equal to the character at index `i` of string `b`, then `kq1` and `kq2` are strings containing the character at index `i` of string `a`, and `vt` is 0. Otherwise, `kq1` and `kq2` are strings containing the minimum and maximum of the integer at index `i` of string `a` and the integer at index `i` of string `b` respectively, `vt` is 1, and `x` and `y` are the minimum and maximum of the integer at index `i` of string `a` and the integer at index `i` of string `b` respectively. In both cases, `i` is 0, and `kq1` and `kq2` are printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer between 2 and 1000, q is 1, stdin contains at least 2t-4 strings x and y, a is a string of the same length and consists only of digits from 1 to 9 and has at least 2 characters, b is a string of the same length and consists only of digits from 1 to 9, i is 1. If a[i] equals b[i], then kq1 and kq2 are strings that start with the first character of a. Otherwise, x is the minimum of the integer values of the ith character of a and b, y is the maximum of the integer values of the ith character of a and b. If vt is 0, then kq1 is the original value of kq1 plus the string representation of y, and kq2 is the original value of kq2 plus the string representation of x. If vt is not 0, then if a[i] > b[i], kq1 is the original value of kq1 plus the string representation of x, and kq2 is the original value of kq2 plus the string representation of y. Otherwise, kq1 is the original value of kq1 plus the string representation of y, and kq2 is the original value of kq2 plus the string representation of x.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is an integer between 2 and 1000, q is 1, stdin contains at least 2t-4 strings x and y, a is a string of the same length and consists only of digits from 1 to 9 and has at least 2 characters, b is a string of the same length and consists only of digits from 1 to 9, i is 2. If the character at index 2 of string a is equal to the character at index 2 of string b, then kq1 and kq2 are strings that are the concatenation of their original values and the character at index 2 of string a. Otherwise, stdin contains at least 2t-5 strings, x is the minimum of the integers represented by the 2nd character of a and b, y is the maximum of the integers represented by the 2nd character of a and b. If vt is 1, then if the 2nd character of a is greater than the 2nd character of b, kq1 is the original value of kq1 plus the string representation of x, and kq2 is the original value of kq2 plus the string representation of y. Otherwise, kq1 is the original value of kq1 plus the string representation of y, and kq2 is the original value of kq2 plus the string representation of x. If vt is 0, then kq1 is the original value of kq1 plus the string representation of y, and kq2 is the original value of kq2 plus the string representation of x.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
