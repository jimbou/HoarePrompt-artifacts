Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 2 and 1000, q is 1, stdin contains at least 2t-5 strings, a is a string of the same length and consists only of digits from 1 to 9 and has at least 2 characters, b is a string of the same length and consists only of digits from 1 to 9, i is 2, x is the minimum of the integers represented by the 2nd character of a and b, y is the maximum of the integers represented by the 2nd character of a and b. If vt is 1, then if the 2nd character of a is greater than the 2nd character of b, kq1 is the original value of kq1 plus the string representation of x, and kq2 is the original value of kq2 plus the string representation of y. Otherwise, kq1 is the original value of kq1 plus the string representation of y, and kq2 is the original value of kq2 plus the string representation of x. If vt is 0, then kq1 is the original value of kq1 plus the string representation of y, and kq2 is the original value of kq2 plus the string representation of x.***
