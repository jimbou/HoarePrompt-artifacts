Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000, q is 0, x is the smaller of the integers represented by the i-th digits of a and b, y is the larger of the integers represented by the i-th digits of a and b, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 1 digit, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9, kq1 is a string containing the value of x, kq2 is a string containing the value of y, vt is 1, i is 0, stdin contains at least 2t-4 strings x and y, where x and y are of the same length and consist only of digits from 1 to 9. The current value of a[i] is greater than the current value of b[i].**

The code block consists of two lines that modify the values of `kq1` and `kq2`. The first line appends the string representation of `x` to `kq1`, and the second line appends the string representation of `y` to `kq2`. Since `x` is the smaller of the integers represented by the i-th digits of `a` and `b`, and `y` is the larger of the integers represented by the i-th digits of `a` and `b`, the values of `kq1` and `kq2` will be strings containing the values of `x` and `y`, respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.
