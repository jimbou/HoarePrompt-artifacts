Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `q` is 2, stdin contains at least 2t-8 strings, `a` is a string of the same length and consists only of digits from 1 to 9 and must have at least 2 characters, `b` is a string of the same length and consists only of digits from 1 to 9, `i` is at least 2, `kq1` and `kq2` are strings that are the concatenation of the characters of `a` and `b` in a specific order, `x` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `y` is the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, `kq1` and `kq2` both include the character at index `i` of `a`. If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, `vt` is 1 if it was originally 0, otherwise `vt` is not equal to 0, `x` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `y` is the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. If `vt` was originally 0, the string `kq1` includes the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` and the string `kq2` includes the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. If `vt` was not originally 0, `kq1` is a string that is the concatenation of the characters of `a` and `b` in a specific order and contains the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` as its last character, `kq2` is a string that is the concatenation of the characters of `a` and `b` in a specific order and contains the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` as its last character. The string `kq1` which is the concatenation of the characters of `a` and `b` in a specific order is being printed, and the string `kq2` which is the concatenation of the characters of `a` and `b` in a specific order is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `kq1`, and `kq2` remain the same as in the initial state. The values of `x` and `y` are updated to be the minimum and maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, respectively. The strings `kq1` and `kq2` are updated according to the values of `a[i]`, `b[i]`, and `vt`. The stdin contains at least 2t-8 strings.
