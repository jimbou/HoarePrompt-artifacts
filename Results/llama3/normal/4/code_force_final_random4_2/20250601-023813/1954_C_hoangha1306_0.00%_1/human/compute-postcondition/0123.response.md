Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `q` is 2, stdin contains at least 2t-10 strings, `a` is a string of the same length and consists only of digits from 1 to 9 and must have at least 3 characters, `b` is a string of the same length and consists only of digits from 1 to 9, `i` is at least 3, `kq1` and `kq2` are strings that are the concatenation of the characters of `a` and `b` in a specific order, `x` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `y` is the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `vt` is 1. If `vt` was originally 0, then `kq1` and `kq2` are appended with the minimum and maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` respectively. Otherwise, `kq1` and `kq2` are appended with the maximum and minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` respectively.**
