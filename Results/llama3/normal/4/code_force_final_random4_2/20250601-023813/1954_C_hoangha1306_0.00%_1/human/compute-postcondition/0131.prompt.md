You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by 2t strings x and y, where x and y are of the same length and consist only of digits from 1 to 9.
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        a = input()
        
        b = input()

        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                kq1 = kq1 + a[i]

        print(kq1)
        
        print(kq2)
        
    #State: t is an integer between 1 and 1000, q is equal to t, stdin is empty, a is an empty string, b is an empty string, kq1 and kq2 are strings consisting of the digits of the original a and b, but with the digits rearranged such that kq1 contains the smaller of the two digits at each position where a and b differ, and kq2 contains the larger of the two digits at each position where a and b differ, vt is either 0 or 1, kq1 is printed, and kq2 is printed

```

Return Postconditions: t is an integer between 1 and 1000, q is equal to t, stdin is empty, a is an empty string, b is an empty string, kq1 and kq2 are strings consisting of the digits of the original a and b, but with the digits rearranged such that kq1 contains the smaller of the two digits at each position where a and b differ, and kq2 contains the larger of the two digits at each position where a and b differ, vt is either 0 or 1, kq1 is printed, and kq2 is printed


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
