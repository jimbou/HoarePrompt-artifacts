Based on the precondition, we can determine that the print statement will print the string `kq1`.

`kq1` is a string consisting of the digits of the original strings `a` and `b`, but with the digits rearranged such that `kq1` contains the smaller of the two digits at each position where `a` and `b` differ.

Since `a` and `b` are empty strings, `kq1` will also be an empty string.

Output: **an empty string**
