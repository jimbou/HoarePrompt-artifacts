Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000, q is 0, stdin contains at least 2t-2 strings x and y, where x and y are of the same length and consist only of digits from 1 to 9, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 1 digit, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9, kq1 is a string consisting of the ith character of a, kq2 is a string consisting of the ith character of a, vt is 0, i is an integer. The current value of i is such that the ith character of a is equal to the ith character of b.**

The code block consists of three lines. The first line appends the ith character of string a to the string kq1. The second line appends the ith character of string a to the string kq2. The third line is a continue statement, which does not affect the state of any variables. 

Since the ith character of a is equal to the ith character of b, the strings kq1 and kq2 will both consist of this common character. No other variables are affected by the code block.
