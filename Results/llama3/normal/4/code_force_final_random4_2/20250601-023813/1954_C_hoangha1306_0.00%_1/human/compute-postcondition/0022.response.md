Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `q` is 0, `a` is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 2 digits, `b` is a string of digits from 1 to 9, `vt` is 1, `i` is 1, `x` is the smaller of the integers represented by the 1st digits of `a` and `b`, `y` is the larger of the integers represented by the 1st digits of `a` and `b`, stdin contains at least 2t-2 strings.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `vt` has been updated to 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The input state still contains at least 2t-2 strings.
