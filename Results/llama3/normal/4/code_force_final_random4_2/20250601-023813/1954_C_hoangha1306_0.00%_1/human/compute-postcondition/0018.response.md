Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000, q is 0, stdin contains at least 2t-2 strings x and y, where x and y are of the same length and consist only of digits from 1 to 9, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 1 digit, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9. If the ith character of a is equal to the ith character of b, then kq1 and kq2 are strings consisting of the ith character of a, vt is 0, and i is an integer. Otherwise, x is the smaller of the integers represented by the i-th digits of a and b, y is the larger of the integers represented by the i-th digits of a and b, kq1 and kq2 are strings containing the values of x and y respectively but not necessarily in that order if vt is 0, otherwise kq1 contains the value of y and kq2 contains the value of x, vt is either 0 or 1, and i is 0.**
