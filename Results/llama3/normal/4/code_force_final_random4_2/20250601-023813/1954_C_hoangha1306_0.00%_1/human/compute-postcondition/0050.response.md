Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `q` is 1, `stdin` contains at least 2t-5 strings, `a` is a string of the same length and consists only of digits from 1 to 9 and has at least 1 character, `b` is a string of the same length and consists only of digits from 1 to 9, `kq1` is an empty string, `kq2` is an empty string, `vt` is 0, `kq1` is printed, `kq2` is printed, `i` is 0, `x` is the minimum of the integer at index `i` of string `a` and the integer at index `i` of string `b`, `y` is the maximum of the integer at index `i` of string `a` and the integer at index `i` of string `b`, and the character at index `i` of string `a` is not equal to the character at index `i` of string `b`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains between 2 and 1000, `q` is still 1, and `stdin` now contains at least 2t-5 strings. The strings `a` and `b` are unchanged, with the same length and consisting only of digits from 1 to 9. The variables `kq1` and `kq2` are still empty strings and have been printed. The variable `vt` is still 0. The variable `i` is still 0. The variables `x` and `y` have been assigned the minimum and maximum values of the integers at index `i` of strings `a` and `b`, respectively. The character at index `i` of string `a` is still not equal to the character at index `i` of string `b`.
