Postcondition: **t is an integer between 2 and 1000, q is 2, stdin contains at least 2t-10 strings, a is a string of the same length and consists only of digits from 1 to 9 and must have at least 3 characters, b is a string of the same length and consists only of digits from 1 to 9, i is at least 3, kq1 and kq2 are strings that are the concatenation of the characters of a and b in a specific order, x is the minimum of a[i] and b[i], y is the maximum of a[i] and b[i], vt is 1. If a[i] > b[i], kq1 is appended with the minimum of a[i] and b[i], and kq2 is appended with the maximum of a[i] and b[i]. Otherwise, kq1 is appended with the maximum of a[i] and b[i], and kq2 is appended with the minimum of a[i] and b[i].**
