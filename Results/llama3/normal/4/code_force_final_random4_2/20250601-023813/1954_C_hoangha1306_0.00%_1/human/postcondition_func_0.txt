This function reads input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000), followed by 2t strings x and y of the same length, consisting only of digits from 1 to 9. It then rearranges the digits of x and y such that at each position where x and y differ, the smaller digit is placed in kq1 and the larger digit is placed in kq2. The function prints kq1 and kq2 for each pair of input strings.
