Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 1000, q is 0, stdin contains at least 2t-4 strings, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 3 digits, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9, kq1 and kq2 are strings consisting of the digits of a and b, i is the index of the next character to be processed in a, x is the minimum of the integer values of the current characters in a and b, and y is the maximum of the integer values of the current characters in a and b. If vt is 0, then kq1 is a string consisting of the digits of a and b plus the maximum of the integer values of the current characters in a and b, and kq2 is a string consisting of the digits of a and b plus the minimum of the integer values of the current characters in a and b. If vt is 1, then if a[i] > b[i], kq1 is a string consisting of the digits of a and the minimum of the integer values of the current characters in a and b, and kq2 is a string consisting of the digits of b and the maximum of the integer values of the current characters in a and b. Otherwise, kq1 is a string consisting of the digits of a and b plus the maximum of the integer values of the current characters in a and b, and kq2 is a string consisting of the digits of a and b plus the minimum of the integer values of the current characters in a and b.***
