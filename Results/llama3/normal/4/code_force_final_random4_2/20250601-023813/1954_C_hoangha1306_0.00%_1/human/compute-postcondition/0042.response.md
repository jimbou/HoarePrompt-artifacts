Based on the precondition, the print statement will print the string `kq2`, which contains the larger of the two digits at each position where the original strings `a` and `b` differ.

Since `kq1` is printed before the print statement, we know that `kq1` contains the smaller of the two digits at each position where `a` and `b` differ. Therefore, `kq2` will contain the larger of the two digits at each position where `a` and `b` differ.

The exact value of `kq2` cannot be determined without knowing the original values of `a` and `b`. However, based on the precondition, we can conclude that `kq2` will contain a string of digits, where each digit is the larger of the two digits at each position where `a` and `b` differ.

Output: **kq2 (where kq2 is a string of digits, each being the larger of the two digits at each position where a and b differ)**
