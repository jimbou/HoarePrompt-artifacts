Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `q` is 0, `x` is the smaller of the integers represented by the i-th digits of `a` and `b`, `y` is the larger of the integers represented by the i-th digits of `a` and `b`, `a` is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 1 digit, `b` is a string of digits from 1 to 9, `kq1` and `kq2` are strings containing the values of `x` and `y` respectively but not necessarily in that order if `vt` is 0, otherwise `kq1` contains the value of `y` and `kq2` contains the value of `x`, `vt` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 0, stdin contains at least 2t-2 strings x and y, where x and y are of the same length and consist only of digits from 1 to 9 if `vt` is 0, otherwise stdin contains at least 2t-4 strings x and y, where x and y are of the same length and consist only of digits from 1 to 9.**
