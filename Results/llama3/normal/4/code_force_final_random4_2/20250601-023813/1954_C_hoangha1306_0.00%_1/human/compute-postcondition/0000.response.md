The code accepts an integer t from the input and converts it to an integer. The value of t is between 1 and 1000. The stdin contains 2t strings x and y, where x and y are of the same length and consist only of digits from 1 to 9. After accepting the value of t, the stdin contains 2t strings x and y.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains 2t strings x and y, where x and y are of the same length and consist only of digits from 1 to 9.**
