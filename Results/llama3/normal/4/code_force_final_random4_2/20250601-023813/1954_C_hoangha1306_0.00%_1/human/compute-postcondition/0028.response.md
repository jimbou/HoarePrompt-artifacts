Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 1000, q is 0, stdin contains at least 2t-2 strings x and y, where x and y are of the same length and consist only of digits from 1 to 9, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 2 digits, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9. If the ith character of a is equal to the ith character of b, then kq1 and kq2 are strings consisting of the ith character of a. Otherwise, x is the smaller of the integers represented by the i-th digits of a and b, y is the larger of the integers represented by the i-th digits of a and b. If vt is 0, then kq1 is a string that is the concatenation of its original value and the string representation of y, and kq2 is a string that is the concatenation of its original value and the string representation of x. If vt is 1, then if a[i] > b[i], kq1 is a string that is the concatenation of its original value and the string representation of x, and kq2 is a string that is the concatenation of its original value and the string representation of y. Otherwise, kq1 is a string that includes the larger of the integers represented by the 1st digits of a and b, and kq2 is a string that includes the smaller of the integers represented by the 1st digits of a and b.***
