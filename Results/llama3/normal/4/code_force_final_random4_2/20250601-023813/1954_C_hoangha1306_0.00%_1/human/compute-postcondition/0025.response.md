Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 1000, q is 0, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 2 digits, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9, vt is 1, i is 1, x is the smaller of the integers represented by the 1st digits of a and b, y is the larger of the integers represented by the 1st digits of a and b, stdin contains at least 2t-2 strings. If a[i] > b[i], then kq1 is a string that is the concatenation of its original value and the string representation of x, and kq2 is a string that is the concatenation of its original value and the string representation of y. Otherwise, kq1 is a string that includes the larger of the integers represented by the 1st digits of a and b, and kq2 is a string that includes the smaller of the integers represented by the 1st digits of a and b.***
