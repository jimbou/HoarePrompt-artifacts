Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 1000, q is 0, stdin contains at least 2t-2 strings x and y, where x and y are of the same length and consist only of digits from 1 to 9, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9, kq1 is an empty string, kq2 is an empty string, vt is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
        kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
        continue
    else:
        x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
        if vt == 0:
            vt = 1
            if a[i] > b[i]:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
            else:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
        else:
            kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 1 and 1000, q is 0, stdin contains at least 2t-2 strings x and y, where x and y are of the same length and consist only of digits from 1 to 9, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 1 digit, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9. If the ith character of a is equal to the ith character of b, then kq1 and kq2 are strings consisting of the ith character of a, vt is 0, and i is an integer. Otherwise, x is the smaller of the integers represented by the i-th digits of a and b, y is the larger of the integers represented by the i-th digits of a and b, kq1 and kq2 are strings containing the values of x and y respectively but not necessarily in that order if vt is 0, otherwise kq1 contains the value of y and kq2 contains the value of x, vt is either 0 or 1, and i is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer between 1 and 1000, q is 0, stdin contains at least 2t-2 strings x and y, where x and y are of the same length and consist only of digits from 1 to 9, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 2 digits, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9. If the ith character of a is equal to the ith character of b, then kq1 and kq2 are strings consisting of the ith character of a. Otherwise, x is the smaller of the integers represented by the i-th digits of a and b, y is the larger of the integers represented by the i-th digits of a and b. If vt is 0, then kq1 is a string that is the concatenation of its original value and the string representation of y, and kq2 is a string that is the concatenation of its original value and the string representation of x. If vt is 1, then if a[i] > b[i], kq1 is a string that is the concatenation of its original value and the string representation of x, and kq2 is a string that is the concatenation of its original value and the string representation of y. Otherwise, kq1 is a string that includes the larger of the integers represented by the 1st digits of a and b, and kq2 is a string that includes the smaller of the integers represented by the 1st digits of a and b.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `q` is 0, `stdin` contains at least 2t-4 strings `x` and `y`, where `x` and `y` are of the same length and consist only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 2 digits, `b` is a string of digits from 1 to 9, `kq1` and `kq2` are strings consisting of the digits of `a` and `b` as described in the previous state, `i` is the index of the next character to be processed in `a`. If `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, then `a` has at least 2 digits, `kq1` and `kq2` are strings consisting of the digits of `a` and `b`. Otherwise, `a` has at least 3 digits, `kq1` and `kq2` are strings consisting of the digits of `a` and `b` plus the minimum and maximum of the integer values of the current characters in `a` and `b`, depending on the value of `vt`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
