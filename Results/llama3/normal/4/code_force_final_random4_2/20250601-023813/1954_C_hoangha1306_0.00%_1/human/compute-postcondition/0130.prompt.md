Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains 2t strings x and y, where x and y are of the same length and consist only of digits from 1 to 9.
Code of the loop:
for q in range(t):
    a = input()
    b = input()
    kq1 = ''
    kq2 = ''
    vt = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] == b[i]:
            kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
            kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
            continue
        else:
            x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
            if vt == 0:
                vt = 1
                if a[i] > b[i]:
                    kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
                    kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
                else:
                    kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                    kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
            else:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
    print(kq1)
    print(kq2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 1 and 1000, q is 0, stdin contains at least 2t-2 strings x and y, where x and y are of the same length and consist only of digits from 1 to 9, a is an empty string, b is an empty string, kq1 and kq2 are strings consisting of the digits of the original a and b, but with the digits rearranged such that kq1 contains the smaller of the two digits at each position where a and b differ, and kq2 contains the larger of the two digits at each position where a and b differ, vt is either 0 or 1, kq1 is printed, and kq2 is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 2 and 1000, q is 1, stdin contains at least 2t-4 strings x and y, a is a string of the same length and consists only of digits from 1 to 9, b is a string of the same length and consists only of digits from 1 to 9, i is equal to the length of a, kq1 and kq2 are strings that are the concatenation of the characters of a and b in a specific order, vt is 1 if a and b have at least one different character, and 0 otherwise, and the string kq1 which is the concatenation of the characters of a and b in a specific order is being printed, and the string kq2 which is the concatenation of the characters of a and b in a specific order is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 2 and 1000, q is 2, stdin contains at least 2t-6 strings x and y, a is a string of the same length and consists only of digits from 1 to 9, b is a string of the same length and consists only of digits from 1 to 9, i is equal to the length of a, kq1 and kq2 are strings that are the concatenation of the characters of a and b in a specific order. If a[i] is equal to b[i], kq1 and kq2 both include the character at index i of a. If a[i] is not equal to b[i], vt is 1 if it was originally 0, otherwise vt is not equal to 0, x is the minimum of a[i] and b[i], y is the maximum of a[i] and b[i]. If vt was originally 0, the string kq1 includes the minimum of a[i] and b[i] and the string kq2 includes the maximum of a[i] and b[i]. If vt was not originally 0, kq1 is a string that is the concatenation of the characters of a and b in a specific order and contains the maximum of a[i] and b[i] as its last character, kq2 is a string that is the concatenation of the characters of a and b in a specific order and contains the minimum of a[i] and b[i] as its last character. The string kq1 and kq2 have been printed, and kq1 is printed, and kq2 is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
