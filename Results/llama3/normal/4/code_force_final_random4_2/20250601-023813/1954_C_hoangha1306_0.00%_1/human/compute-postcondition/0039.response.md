Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000, q is 0, stdin contains at least 2t-2 strings x and y, where x and y are of the same length and consist only of digits from 1 to 9, a is an empty string, b is an empty string, kq1 and kq2 are strings consisting of the digits of the original a and b, but with the digits rearranged such that kq1 contains the smaller of the two digits at each position where a and b differ, and kq2 contains the larger of the two digits at each position where a and b differ, vt is either 0 or 1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the strings `a` and `b` are empty, and the strings `kq1` and `kq2` contain the digits of the original `a` and `b`, but with the digits rearranged such that `kq1` contains the smaller of the two digits at each position where `a` and `b` differ, and `kq2` contains the larger of the two digits at each position where `a` and `b` differ. The value of `vt` is either 0 or 1, depending on whether the loop encountered any differing digits. The other variables `t`, `q`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
