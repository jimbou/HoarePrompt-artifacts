Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `q` is 2, `stdin` contains at least 2t-8 strings x and y, `a` is a string of the same length and consists only of digits from 1 to 9 and must have at least 1 character, `b` is a string of the same length and consists only of digits from 1 to 9, `i` is at least 1, `kq1` is an empty string, `kq2` is an empty string, `vt` is 0, `x` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `y` is the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and the string `kq1` which is the concatenation of the characters of `a` and `b` in a specific order is being printed, and the string `kq2` which is the concatenation of the characters of `a` and `b` in a specific order is being printed. Additionally, `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`. The current value of `vt` is 0.***
