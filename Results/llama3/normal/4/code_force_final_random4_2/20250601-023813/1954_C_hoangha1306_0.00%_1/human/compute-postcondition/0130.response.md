Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000, q is equal to t, stdin is empty, a is an empty string, b is an empty string, kq1 and kq2 are strings consisting of the digits of the original a and b, but with the digits rearranged such that kq1 contains the smaller of the two digits at each position where a and b differ, and kq2 contains the larger of the two digits at each position where a and b differ, vt is either 0 or 1, kq1 is printed, and kq2 is printed**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has processed all the input strings, and the variables a and b are empty. The variables kq1 and kq2 contain the rearranged digits of the original input strings, with kq1 containing the smaller digit at each position where the input strings differ, and kq2 containing the larger digit at each position where the input strings differ. The variable vt is either 0 or 1, depending on whether the input strings had any different characters. The strings kq1 and kq2 have been printed.
