Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 1000, q is 2, stdin contains at least 2t-6 strings x and y, a is a string of the same length and consists only of digits from 1 to 9 and must have at least 3 characters, b is a string of the same length and consists only of digits from 1 to 9, i is at least 3, kq1 and kq2 are strings that are the concatenation of the characters of a and b in a specific order. If a[i] is equal to b[i], kq1 and kq2 both include the character at index i of a. If a[i] is not equal to b[i], vt is 1 if it was originally 0, otherwise vt is not equal to 0, x is the minimum of a[i] and b[i], y is the maximum of a[i] and b[i]. If vt was originally 0, the string kq1 includes the minimum of a[i] and b[i] and the string kq2 includes the maximum of a[i] and b[i]. If vt was not originally 0, kq1 is a string that is the concatenation of the characters of a and b in a specific order and contains the maximum of a[i] and b[i] as its last character, kq2 is a string that is the concatenation of the characters of a and b in a specific order and contains the minimum of a[i] and b[i] as its last character. The string kq1 which is the concatenation of the characters of a and b in a specific order is being printed, and the string kq2 which is the concatenation of the characters of a and b in a specific order is being printed. If a[i] is equal to b[i], then vt is not equal to 0, kq1 and kq2 both include the character at index i of a. If a[i] is not equal to b[i], then vt is 1 if it was originally 0, otherwise vt is not equal to 0, x is the minimum of a[i] and b[i], y is the maximum of a[i] and b[i]. If vt was originally 0, the string kq1 includes the minimum of a[i] and b[i] and the string kq2 includes the maximum of a[i] and b[i]. If vt was not originally 0, kq1 is a string that is the concatenation of the characters of a and b in a specific order and contains the maximum of a[i] and b[i] as its last character, kq2 is a string that is the concatenation of the characters of a and b in a specific order and contains the minimum of a[i] and b[i] as its last character. The string kq1 and kq2 have been printed.**

The code snippet modifies the strings kq1 and kq2 by appending the character at index i of string a to both of them. The value of i is at least 3, and the strings a and b have the same length and consist only of digits from 1 to 9. The strings kq1 and kq2 are the concatenation of the characters of a and b in a specific order. If a[i] is equal to b[i], both kq1 and kq2 include the character at index i of a. If a[i] is not equal to b[i], vt is 1 if it was originally 0, otherwise vt is not equal to 0, and x and y are the minimum and maximum of a[i] and b[i], respectively. The strings kq1 and kq2 have been printed.
