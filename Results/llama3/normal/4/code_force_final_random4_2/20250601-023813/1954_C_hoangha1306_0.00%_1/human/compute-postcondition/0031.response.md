Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `q` is 0, `stdin` contains at least 2t-4 strings, `a` is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 3 digits, `b` is a string of digits from 1 to 9, `kq1` and `kq2` are strings consisting of the digits of `a` and `b`, `i` is the index of the next character to be processed in `a`, `x` is the minimum of the integer values of the current characters in `a` and `b`, and `y` is the maximum of the integer values of the current characters in `a` and `b`.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `kq1`, and `kq2` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still the index of the next character to be processed in `a`, but it is now pointing to the next character after the current one that was used to calculate `x` and `y`. The value of `x` is the minimum of the integer values of the current characters in `a` and `b`, and the value of `y` is the maximum of the integer values of the current characters in `a` and `b`. The `stdin` now contains at least 2t-4 strings, since two strings were consumed to calculate `x` and `y`.
