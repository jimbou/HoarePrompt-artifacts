Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `q` is 1, `stdin` contains at least 2t-5 strings, `a` is a string of the same length and consists only of digits from 1 to 9 and has at least 2 characters, `b` is a string of the same length and consists only of digits from 1 to 9, `i` is 2, `x` is the minimum of the integers represented by the 2nd character of `a` and `b`, `y` is the maximum of the integers represented by the 2nd character of `a` and `b`.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `q`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `x` is the minimum of the integers represented by the 2nd character of `a` and `b`, and the value of `y` is the maximum of the integers represented by the 2nd character of `a` and `b`. The stdin now contains at least 2t-5 strings.
