Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `q` is 1, `stdin` contains at least 2t-4 strings `x` and `y`, `a` is a string of the same length and consists only of digits from 1 to 9 and has at least 1 character, `b` is a string of the same length and consists only of digits from 1 to 9. If the character at index `i` of string `a` is equal to the character at index `i` of string `b`, then `kq1` and `kq2` are strings containing the character at index `i` of string `a`, and `vt` is 0. Otherwise, `kq1` and `kq2` are strings containing the minimum and maximum of the integer at index `i` of string `a` and the integer at index `i` of string `b` respectively, `vt` is 1, and `x` and `y` are the minimum and maximum of the integer at index `i` of string `a` and the integer at index `i` of string `b` respectively. In both cases, `i` is 0, and `kq1` and `kq2` are printed.**
