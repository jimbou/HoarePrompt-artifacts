Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tests` is an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000), stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(tests):
    slength = int(input())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    c = input()
    no = True
    if c == a or c == b:
        no = False
        print('NO')
    else:
        for x in c:
            if x not in a and x not in b:
                print('YES')
                no = False
                break
    if no:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *tests is an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000), i is 0, slength is an integer, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string. If c is equal to either a or b, 'NO' is printed and no is False. Otherwise, c must have at least slength characters, no is False if any character in c is not present in either string a or string b, otherwise no remains True. If no is True, 'NO' is being printed. Otherwise, no change is made. stdin contains t-1 test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *tests is an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000), i is 1, slength is an integer equal to the input integer, a is a string equal to the second input string, b is a string equal to the third input string, c is a string equal to the fourth input string. If c has at least slength characters and all characters in c are present in either a or b, or c is equal to a or b, or the last character of c is present in a or b, then 'NO' is printed and no is True. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed and no is False.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *tests is an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000), i is 2, slength is an integer equal to the input integer, a is a string equal to the second input string, b is a string equal to the third input string, c is a string equal to the fourth input string. If c is equal to a or b, or if any character in c is not present in either a or b, then 'NO' is being printed. Otherwise, no operation is performed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
