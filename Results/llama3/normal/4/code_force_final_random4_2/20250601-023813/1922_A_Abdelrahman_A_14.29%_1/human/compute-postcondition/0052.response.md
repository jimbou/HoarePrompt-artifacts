Postcondition: **tests is an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000), i is 1, slength is an integer equal to the input integer, a is a string equal to the second input string, b is a string equal to the third input string, c is a string equal to the fourth input string. If c is equal to a or b, 'NO' is printed and no is False. Otherwise, if the last character of c is not present in a and not present in b, 'YES' is printed and no is False. In all other cases, no is True if c has at least slength characters and all characters in c are present in either a or b, otherwise no is False. stdin contains t-3 test cases.**
