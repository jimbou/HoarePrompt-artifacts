Postcondition: ***tests is an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000), i is 0, slength is an integer, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string. If c is equal to either a or b, 'NO' is printed and no is False. Otherwise, c must have at least slength characters, no is False if any character in c is not present in either string a or string b, otherwise no remains True. If no is True, 'NO' is being printed. Otherwise, no change is made. stdin contains t-1 test cases.***
