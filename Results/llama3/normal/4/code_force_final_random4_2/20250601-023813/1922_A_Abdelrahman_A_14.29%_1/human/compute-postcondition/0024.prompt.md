Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *tests is an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000), i is 0, slength is an integer, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, no is True, stdin contains t-1 test cases, c is neither equal to a nor equal to b
Code of the loop:
for x in c:
    if x not in a and x not in b:
        print('YES')
        no = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *tests is an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000), i is 0, slength is an integer, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string that must have at least 1 character, stdin contains t-1 test cases, c is neither equal to a nor equal to b, x is the first character in the string c. If the first character of c is not present in either string a or string b, then no is False. Otherwise, no remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *tests is an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000), i is 0, slength is an integer, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string that must have at least 2 characters, stdin contains t-1 test cases, c is neither equal to a nor equal to b, x is the second character in the string c. If the second character of c is not present in either string a or string b, then no is False. Otherwise, no remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: tests is an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000), i is 0, slength is an integer, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string that must have at least 3 characters, stdin contains t-1 test cases, c is neither equal to a nor equal to b, x is the third character in the string c. If the third character of c is not present in either string a or string b, then no is False. Otherwise, no remains True.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
