Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not.

Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. The program first checks if string c is equal to either a or b. If it is, then there cannot exist a template t that matches a and b but not c, because c would match the template as well. In this case, the program correctly prints 'NO'.

2. If c is not equal to a or b, the program then checks if any character in c is not present in either a or b. If such a character exists, then a template t can be constructed by making that character uppercase in the template. This would ensure that a and b match the template (since they don't contain that character), but c would not match the template (since it contains that character). In this case, the program correctly prints 'YES'.

3. If neither of the above conditions is true, then for every character in c, that character must be present in either a or b. In this case, it is not possible to construct a template t that matches a and b but not c, because any template that matches a and b would also match c. Therefore, the program correctly prints 'NO' in this case.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem, and it handles all possible cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
