According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tests`. If `tests` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `tests` is an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000), stdin contains t test cases. So for the loop to be executed  the variable `tests` must be greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **`tests` is an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000), stdin contains t test cases, `i` is 0**
