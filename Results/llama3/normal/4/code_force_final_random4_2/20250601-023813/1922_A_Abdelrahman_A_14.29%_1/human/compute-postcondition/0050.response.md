Postcondition: **tests is an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000), i is 1, slength is an integer equal to the input integer, a is a string equal to the second input string, b is a string equal to the third input string, c is a string equal to the fourth input string that must have at least 3 characters, x is the second character in the string c, no is False. If x is not in a and not in b, then the program continues with the same values. Otherwise, the program does nothing.**
