Postcondition: ***`tests` is an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000), `i` is 2, `slength` is an integer equal to the input integer, `a` is a string equal to the second input string, `b` is a string equal to the third input string, `c` is a non-empty string equal to the fourth input string. If the first character `x` in the string `c` is not present in either string `a` or string `b`, then `no` is False. Otherwise, the value of `no` remains unchanged.***
