Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by three strings a, b, and c. It then checks if string c is equal to either a or b, or if any character in c is not present in either a or b. If either condition is true, it prints 'NO' for that test case. If neither condition is true, it prints 'YES' for that test case. The function processes all test cases and then terminates, leaving the standard input empty.**
