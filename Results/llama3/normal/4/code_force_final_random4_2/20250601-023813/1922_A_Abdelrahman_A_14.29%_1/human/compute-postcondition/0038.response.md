Output: **`tests` is an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000), `i` is 1, `slength` is an integer equal to the input integer, `a` is a string equal to the second input string, `b` is a string equal to the third input string, `c` is a string equal to the fourth input string that must have at least 1 character, `no` is True if `c` has at least `slength` characters and all characters in `c` are present in either `a` or `b`, otherwise `no` is False, `x` is the first character in `c`. The current value of `x` is not present in `a` and not present in `b`. stdin contains t-3 test cases, and 'YES' is printed**
