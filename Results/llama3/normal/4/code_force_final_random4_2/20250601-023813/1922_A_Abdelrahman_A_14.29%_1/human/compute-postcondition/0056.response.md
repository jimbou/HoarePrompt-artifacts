Postcondition: ***tests is an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000), i is 1, slength is an integer equal to the input integer, a is a string equal to the second input string, b is a string equal to the third input string, c is a string equal to the fourth input string. If c has at least slength characters and all characters in c are present in either a or b, or c is equal to a or b, or the last character of c is present in a or b, then 'NO' is printed and no is True.
