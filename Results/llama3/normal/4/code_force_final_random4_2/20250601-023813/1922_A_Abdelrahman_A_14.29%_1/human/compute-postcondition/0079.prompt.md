Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: tests is an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000), i is 2, slength is an integer equal to the input integer, a is a string equal to the second input string, b is a string equal to the third input string, c is a string equal to the fourth input string, no is True.
Code of the loop:
for x in c:
    if x not in a and x not in b:
        print('YES')
        no = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`tests` is an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000), `i` is 2, `slength` is an integer equal to the input integer, `a` is a string equal to the second input string, `b` is a string equal to the third input string, `c` is a non-empty string equal to the fourth input string. If the first character `x` in the string `c` is not present in either string `a` or string `b`, then `no` is False. Otherwise, the value of `no` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *tests is an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000), i is 2, slength is an integer equal to the input integer, a is a string equal to the second input string, b is a string equal to the third input string, c is a non-empty string with at least two characters equal to the fourth input string, x is the second character in the string c, if the second character in the string c is not present in either string a or string b, then no is False and 'YES' is being printed. Otherwise, no remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: tests is an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000), i is 2, slength is an integer equal to the input integer, a is a string equal to the second input string, b is a string equal to the third input string, c is a non-empty string with at least three characters equal to the fourth input string, x is the third character in the string c. If the third character in the string c is not present in either string a or string b, then no is False. Otherwise, no remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
