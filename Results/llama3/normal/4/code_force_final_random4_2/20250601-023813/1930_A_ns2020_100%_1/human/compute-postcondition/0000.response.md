The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. 

In the initial state, the standard input contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 5000) followed by `t` test cases. 

After executing the code, the value of `t` is assigned the integer value from the standard input, and the standard input now contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 50) followed by 2n integers `a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}` (1 <= a_i <= 10^7).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 50) followed by 2n integers `a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}` (1 <= a_i <= 10^7).**
