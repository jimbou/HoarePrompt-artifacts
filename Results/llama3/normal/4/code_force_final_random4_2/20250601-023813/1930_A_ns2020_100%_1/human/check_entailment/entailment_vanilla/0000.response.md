Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum final score that can be achieved by performing n moves on 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. The move involves choosing two integers x and y, adding the minimum of x and y to the score, and erasing x and y from the whiteboard.

The given program defines a function `func()` that takes no arguments. It reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and the list of integers `A`. It sorts the list `A` in ascending order and then prints the sum of every other element in the sorted list, starting from the first element (index 0).

The key insight here is that by sorting the list of integers, the program can easily find the minimum of each pair of integers. Since the list is sorted, the minimum of each pair will always be the smaller of the two elements. By summing up every other element in the sorted list, the program effectively calculates the maximum final score that can be achieved.

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It reads the input correctly, sorts the list of integers, and calculates the maximum final score by summing up every other element in the sorted list.

Correctness: **True**
