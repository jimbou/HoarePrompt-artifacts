Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the final score by selecting the minimum of each pair of numbers and adding it to the score. The key insight is that the numbers are sorted in ascending order, and then the program selects every other number starting from the first one (i.e., the smallest number). This ensures that the minimum of each pair is always selected, which maximizes the final score.

The program correctly handles all potential cases, including the edge cases where n = 1 or where all numbers are the same. The use of the slice notation `A[::2]` to select every other number starting from the first one is a concise and efficient way to implement the strategy.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for all valid inputs.
