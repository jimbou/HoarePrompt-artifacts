Output State: **t is 0, stdin is empty, n is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, A is a sorted list of 2n integers between 1 and 10^7 inclusive, and the sum of every other element of the list A starting from the first element has been printed.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` has been decremented to 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The input stream `stdin` is now empty, as all test cases have been read and processed. The variables `n` and `A` still hold the values from the last iteration of the loop, which are an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive and a sorted list of 2n integers between 1 and 10^7 inclusive, respectively. Finally, the sum of every other element of the list `A` starting from the first element has been printed for all test cases.
