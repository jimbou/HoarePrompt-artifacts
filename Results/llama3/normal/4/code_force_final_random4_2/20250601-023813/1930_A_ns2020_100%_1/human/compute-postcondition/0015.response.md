Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 4995 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, A is a sorted list of 2n integers between 1 and 10^7 inclusive, stdin contains t test cases, and the sum of every other element in the sorted list A, starting from the first element is printed**

In this output state, the value of t has been decremented by 1, so it is now between 0 and 4995 inclusive. The values of n and A remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the code. The stdin still contains t test cases, but the value of t has been updated. The sum of every other element in the sorted list A, starting from the first element, is still printed.
