Output State: **t is an integer between -1 and 4998 inclusive, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n} (1 <= a_i <= 10^7), n is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, A is a sorted list of 2n integers between 1 and 10^7 inclusive, and the sum of every other element of the list A starting from the first element is being printed**

In natural language, the value of t has been decremented by 1, so it is now between -1 and 4998 inclusive. The number of test cases in stdin has also been decremented by 1, so it now contains t test cases. The values of n, A, and the sum of every other element of A remain unchanged.
