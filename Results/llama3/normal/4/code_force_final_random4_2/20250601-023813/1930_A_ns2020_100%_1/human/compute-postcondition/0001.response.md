According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive. This range ensures that `t` is greater than 0, so no adjustment is needed.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 50) followed by 2n integers `a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}` (1 <= a_i <= 10^7).**
