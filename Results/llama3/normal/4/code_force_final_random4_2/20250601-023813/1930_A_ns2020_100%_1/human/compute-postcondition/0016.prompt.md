Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 50) followed by 2n integers `a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}` (1 <= a_i <= 10^7).
Code of the loop:
while t:
    n = int(input())
    A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    A.sort()
    print(sum(A[::2]))
    t = t - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between -1 and 4998 inclusive, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n} (1 <= a_i <= 10^7), n is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, A is a sorted list of 2n integers between 1 and 10^7 inclusive, and the sum of every other element of the list A starting from the first element is being printed
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer between -1 and 4996 inclusive, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n} (1 <= a_i <= 10^7), n is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, A is a sorted list of 2n integers between 1 and 10^7 inclusive, and the sum of every other element of the list A starting from the first element is being printed
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is an integer between 0 and 4995 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, A is a sorted list of 2n integers between 1 and 10^7 inclusive, stdin contains t test cases, and the sum of every other element in the sorted list A, starting from the first element is printed


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
