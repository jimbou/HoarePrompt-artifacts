The code prints the sum of every other element in the sorted list A, starting from the first element. Since A is a sorted list of 2n integers between 1 and 10^7 inclusive, the sum will be the sum of the first, third, fifth, and so on, elements of the list A.
Output: **t is an integer between 1 and 4996 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, A is a sorted list of 2n integers between 1 and 10^7 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases, and the sum of every other element in the sorted list A, starting from the first element is printed**
