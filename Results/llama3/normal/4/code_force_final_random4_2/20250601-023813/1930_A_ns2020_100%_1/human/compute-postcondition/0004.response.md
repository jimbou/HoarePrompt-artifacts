Output: **t is an integer between 0 and 4999 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n} (1 <= a_i <= 10^7), n is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, A is a sorted list of 2n integers between 1 and 10^7 inclusive, and the sum of every other element of the list A starting from the first element is being printed**
