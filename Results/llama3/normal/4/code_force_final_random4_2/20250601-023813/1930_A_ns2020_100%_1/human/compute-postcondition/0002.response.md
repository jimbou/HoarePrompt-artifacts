Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 4999 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n} (1 <= a_i <= 10^7), n is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, A is a sorted list of 2n integers between 1 and 10^7 inclusive.**

Explanation:
The first line of the code reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, and each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by 2n integers, the value of `t` is decremented by 1 after reading the first test case. The remaining test cases are still in stdin.

The second line reads 2n integers from stdin, splits them into a list, and assigns it to the variable `A`. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, the list `A` will contain between 2 and 100 integers.

The third line sorts the list `A` in ascending order. The sorted list `A` will contain the same integers as before, but in a sorted order.

Therefore, the final output state includes the updated values of `t`, `n`, and `A`, as well as the remaining test cases in stdin.
