The code prints the sum of every other element of the list A starting from the first element.
Since A is a sorted list of 2n integers between 1 and 10^7 inclusive, the sum of every other element of the list A starting from the first element will be the sum of the first, third, fifth, ..., (2n-1)th elements of the list A.
Output: **sum of every other element of the list A starting from the first element (where A is a sorted list of 2n integers between 1 and 10^7 inclusive)**
