Output State: **`t` is an integer between -1 and 4996 inclusive, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n} (1 <= a_i <= 10^7), n is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, A is a sorted list of 2n integers between 1 and 10^7 inclusive, and the sum of every other element of the list A starting from the first element is being printed**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` has been decremented by 1, so it is now between -1 and 4996 inclusive. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t` test cases, each consisting of 2n integers between 1 and 10^7 inclusive. The list A is still sorted and contains 2n integers between 1 and 10^7 inclusive, and the sum of every other element of the list A starting from the first element is still being printed.
