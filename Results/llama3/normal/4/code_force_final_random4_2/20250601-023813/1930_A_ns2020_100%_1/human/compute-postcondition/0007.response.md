Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 4997 inclusive, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n} (1 <= a_i <= 10^7), n is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, A is a sorted list of 2n integers between 1 and 10^7 inclusive, and the sum of every other element of the list A starting from the first element is being printed**

The code reads the value of n from the input and assigns it to the variable n. Then, it reads 2n integers from the input, splits them into a list, and assigns it to the variable A. The list A is then sorted in ascending order. The sum of every other element of the list A starting from the first element is not printed in this code snippet, but it is mentioned in the initial state that it is being printed. The value of t is decreased by 1 as one test case has been processed.
