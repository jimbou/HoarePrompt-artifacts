Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and the `2n` integers themselves.
3. It sorts the list of integers `A` in ascending order.
4. It calculates the sum of every other element of the sorted list `A` starting from the first element, which is equivalent to selecting the minimum of each pair of integers and adding it to the score.
5. It prints the calculated sum, which represents the maximum final score that can be achieved.

The key insight here is that by sorting the list of integers, the program can easily select the minimum of each pair of integers by taking every other element of the sorted list. This is because the minimum of a pair of integers is always the smaller of the two, and by sorting the list, the smaller integer is always the first element of each pair.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and produces the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
