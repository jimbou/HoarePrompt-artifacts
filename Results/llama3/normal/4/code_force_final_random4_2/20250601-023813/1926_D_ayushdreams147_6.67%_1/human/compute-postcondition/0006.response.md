Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of at least 1 non-negative integer, `num` is the first element in the list. If `num` is not in the dictionary `count`, then `res` is set to 1 and `count` is updated with the key-value pair (`num ^ (1 << 31) - 1`, 1). Otherwise, `res` remains 0 and the count of `num` in the dictionary `count` is decreased by 1.***
