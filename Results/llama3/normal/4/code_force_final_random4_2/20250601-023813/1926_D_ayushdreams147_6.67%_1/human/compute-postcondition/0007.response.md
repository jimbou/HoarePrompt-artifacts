To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for num in a:`, which means we can only adjust the state of `num` and `a`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `num` is the first element in the list `a`. For the loop to execute again, `a` must have at least one more element, and `num` should be the next element in the list.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of at least 2 non-negative integers, `num` is the second element in the list.**
