#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers, each less than 2^31.
    res = 0
    count = {}
    for num in a:
        if num not in count:
            count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1] = count.get(num ^ (1 << 31) - 1, 0) + 1
            res += 1
        else:
            count[num] -= 1
        
    #State: n is a positive integer, a is an empty list, res is the number of unique non-negative integers in the original list a, count is a dictionary where each key is a non-negative integer from the original list a and each value is 0.
    return res
    #The program returns res, which is the number of unique non-negative integers in the original list a, but since a is an empty list, res is 0.

#Overall this is what the function does:Counts the number of unique non-negative integers in a given list and returns the count, while emptying the original list.
