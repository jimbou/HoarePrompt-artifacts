Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of at least 2 non-negative integers, `num` is the second element in the list. If `num` is not in `count`, `count` has an additional key-value pair where the key is `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` and the value is the previous value of this key plus 1, and `res` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `count[num]` is decreased by 1.***
