Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of at least 3 non-negative integers, `num` is the third element in the list. If `num` is not in `count`, then `count` has a new key `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` with a value one more than its original value, and `res` is one more than its original value. Otherwise, `count[num]` is either a non-negative integer or -1.***
