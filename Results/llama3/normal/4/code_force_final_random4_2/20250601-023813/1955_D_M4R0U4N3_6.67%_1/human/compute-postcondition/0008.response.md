To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `m`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 1. The value of `m` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `j` is 1. If `a[j]` is in `todo`, then `todo` is a set of `m-1` positive integers not greater than 10^6 and `done` is a set containing one positive integer not greater than 10^6. Otherwise, `todo` is a set of `m` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `done` is an empty set, and `extra` is a set containing one positive integer not greater than 10^6 which is not in `todo`.**
