The only variable in the loop head is variable  j, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1 and `m` must be greater than 2.
State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than 2, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers not greater than 10^6, j is 2, ans is either 1, 2, 3 or 4, r is n, stdin contains t-4 test cases. If a[j] is in todo, then todo is a set of m-3 positive integers not greater than 10^6 and done is a set containing two positive integers which are the current and previous values of a[j]. Otherwise, todo is a set of m-2 positive integers not greater than 10^6 and extra is a set containing a[j] and another positive integer which is the current value of a[j].**
