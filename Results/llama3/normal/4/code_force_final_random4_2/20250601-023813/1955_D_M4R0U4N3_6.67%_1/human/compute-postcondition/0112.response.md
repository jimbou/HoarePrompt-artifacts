Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, n is a positive integer that must be greater than 1, m is 0, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers not greater than 10^6, j is 0, ans is either 1, 2 or 3, r is 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases, a[r] is in done, a[r] is not in todo, a[r] is in extra.**

The code removes the element at index `r` of `a` from `todo` and adds it to `done`. Since `a[r]` was not in `todo` initially, its removal does not change the state of the variables. However, adding it to `done` increases the length of `done` by 1. If the length of `done` was already greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` remains either 2 or 3. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. Additionally, since `a[r]` is not in `todo`, it is added to `extra`.
