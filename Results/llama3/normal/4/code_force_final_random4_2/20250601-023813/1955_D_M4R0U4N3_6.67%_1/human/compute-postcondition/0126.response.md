Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `j` is 0, `ans` is a positive integer, `r` is `n`, `todo` is a set of unique positive integers, `done` is an empty set, `extra` is a set containing `a[j]`, and `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases.**

In this output state, the only change is that the set `extra` now contains the value of `a[j]`, which is a positive integer not greater than 10^6. All other variables remain unchanged.
