Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than 1, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers not greater than 10^6, stdin contains t-1 test cases, j is 2. If a[j] is in todo, then todo is a set of m-3 positive integers not greater than 10^6 and done is a set containing one positive integer not greater than 10^6 which is a[j]. Otherwise, todo is a set of m positive integers not greater than 10^6, done is an empty set, and extra is a set containing three positive integers not greater than 10^6 which are not in todo and include a[j].***
