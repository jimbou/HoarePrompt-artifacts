Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer that is less than `n`, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `j` is `m`, `r` is `m+1`, `old` is `a[m+1]`. If the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 2, otherwise `ans` is 1. If `a[m]` is in `todo`, then `todo` is empty, `extra` contains all elements of `a` that were not in `todo` initially except for `a[m]`, and `done` contains all elements of `a` that were in `todo` initially plus `a[m]`. Otherwise, `extra` contains all elements of `a` that were not in `todo` initially and contains `a[m]`, `todo` is empty if `a[m]` is not in `done`, otherwise `todo` contains `a[m]`, and `done` contains all elements of `a` that were in `todo` initially. The current value of `done` has at least `k` elements if `ans` is 2, otherwise it has less than `k` elements. If `old` is in `extra`, then `old` is not in `extra` and is equal to `a[m+1]`. If `old` is in `done`, then `done` does not contain `old` and `todo` contains `old`. `extra` also contains `a[r]` which is `a[m+1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `extra` now also contains the element `a[m+1]`, which is the same as `old`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
