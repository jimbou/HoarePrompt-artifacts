Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer that is less than `n`, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `j` is `m`, `ans` is 1 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0, `r` is `m`, `extra` contains all elements of `a` that were not in `todo` initially and contains `a[m-1]`, `todo` is empty if `a[m-1]` is not in `done`, otherwise `todo` contains `a[m-1]`, `done` contains all elements of `a` that were in `todo` initially, and `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `extra` has been updated to include `a[m-1]`, which was not in `todo` initially. The values of the other variables remain the same. Note that `todo` is empty if `a[m-1]` is not in `done`, otherwise it contains `a[m-1]`. The rest of the variables maintain their initial values.
