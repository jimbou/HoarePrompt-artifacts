Output State: **t is 0, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer that is less than n, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers not greater than 10^6, j is m, r is n, ans is the number of times the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k, extra contains all elements of a that were not in todo initially and contains all elements of a that were in todo initially but were removed from done, todo is empty if a[n-1] is not in done, otherwise todo contains a[n-1], and done contains all elements of a that were in todo initially and were not removed from done, and the number of times the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the number of test cases `t` will be 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a` will remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop. The variable `j` will be equal to `m`, and `r` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has processed all elements of `a`. The variable `ans` will hold the total number of times the number of elements in `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the execution of the loop. The set `extra` will contain all elements of `a` that were not in `todo` initially and all elements of `a` that were in `todo` initially but were removed from `done`. The set `todo` will be empty if the last element of `a` is not in `done`, otherwise it will contain the last element of `a`. The set `done` will contain all elements of `a` that were in `todo` initially and were not removed from `done`. Finally, the number of times the number of elements in `done` was greater than or equal to `k` will be printed.
