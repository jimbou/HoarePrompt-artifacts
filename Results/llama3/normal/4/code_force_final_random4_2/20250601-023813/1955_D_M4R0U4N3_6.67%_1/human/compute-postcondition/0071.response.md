Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 1, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than 1, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers not greater than 10^6, j is 1, ans is either 1, 2, 3 or 4, r is n, stdin contains t-4 test cases. If a[j] is in todo, then todo is a set of m-2 positive integers not greater than 10^6 and done is a set containing two positive integers which are the current and previous values of a[j]. Otherwise, todo is a set of m-1 positive integers not greater than 10^6 and extra is a set containing a[j] and another positive integer which is the current value of a[j].***
