Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `j` is `m`, `ans` is 1 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0, `r` is `n`, `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases, `todo` is empty, `done` contains all elements of `a` that were in `todo` initially, and `extra` contains all elements of `a` that were not in `todo` initially.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated based on the condition `len(done) >= k`. If the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is set to 1, otherwise it is set to 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
