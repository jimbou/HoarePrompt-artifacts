Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than 1, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers not greater than 10^6, j is 1, ans is either 1, 2, 3 or 4, todo is a set of m-2 positive integers not greater than 10^6, done is a set containing two positive integers which are the current and previous values of a[j], r is n, stdin contains t-4 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `todo` has been reduced by one, as the current value of `a[j]` has been removed from it. The value of `done` has been updated to include the current value of `a[j]`, in addition to its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.
