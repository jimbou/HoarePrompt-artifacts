Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, n is a positive integer, m is 0, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers not greater than 10^6, j is m, ans is either 1, 2, 3 or 4, r is n, stdin contains t-4 test cases. If all elements of a are in todo, then todo is an empty set and done is a set containing all elements of a. Otherwise, extra is a set containing all elements of a that are not in todo, and done is a set containing all elements of a that are in todo.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will be as follows:

* The variables t, n, k, a, ans, and r will retain their initial values.
* The variable m will be 0, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
* The variable j will be equal to m, which is 0.
* The set todo will be empty if all elements of a were present in todo initially. Otherwise, it will contain the elements of a that were not present in todo initially.
* The set done will contain all elements of a that were present in todo initially.
* The set extra will contain all elements of a that were not present in todo initially.
* The contents of stdin will remain unchanged, containing t-4 test cases.
