Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `n` is a positive integer that must be greater than 0, `m` is 0, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `j` is 0, `ans` is either 1 or 0, `r` is 0, `old` is the first element of `a` (a[r-m] = a[0-m] = a[0]), stdin contains `t-4` test cases. If the first element of `a` is in `extra`, then `extra` no longer contains the first element of `a` (a[0]), and `done` is a set containing all elements of `a` that are in `todo`. If all elements of `a` are in `todo`, then `todo` is an empty set. If the first element of `a` is in `done`, then `done` is a set containing all elements of `a` except the first one, and `todo` is a set containing the first element of `a`, and `extra` is a set containing all elements of `a` that are not in `todo` (which is empty in this case). Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. Additionally, the element at index `r` of `a` is not in `todo`. `extra` now contains the element at index `r` of `a` (a[r]).**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that the element at index `r` of `a` is now in `extra`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
