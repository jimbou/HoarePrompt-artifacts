Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer that is less than n, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers not greater than 10^6, j is m, r is m+2, old is a[m+1], extra contains all elements of a that were not in todo initially except for a[m], done contains all elements of a that were in todo initially plus a[m], todo contains a[m+1]. If the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k, then ans is 3, otherwise ans is 2.**

In this final state, the value of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `j`, and `r` remains unchanged. The value of `old` is still `a[m+1]`. The `extra` list still contains all elements of `a` that were not in `todo` initially, except for `a[m]`. The `done` list now contains all elements of `a` that were in `todo` initially, plus `a[m]`. The `todo` list now contains `a[m+1]`. The value of `ans` depends on the number of elements in `done`, which is either 3 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, or 2 otherwise.
