Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `j` is 1, `ans` is either 1, 2, 3 or 4, `r` is `n`, if `a[j]` is in `todo`, then `todo` is a set of `m-1` positive integers not greater than 10^6 and `done` is a set containing a single positive integer which is the current value of `a[j]`, otherwise `todo` is a set of `m-1` positive integers not greater than 10^6 and `extra` is a set containing `a[j]` and another positive integer which is the current value of `a[j]`, stdin contains `t-4` test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the set `extra` now contains the current value of `a[j]`, which is a positive integer not greater than 10^6. The other variables remain unchanged.
