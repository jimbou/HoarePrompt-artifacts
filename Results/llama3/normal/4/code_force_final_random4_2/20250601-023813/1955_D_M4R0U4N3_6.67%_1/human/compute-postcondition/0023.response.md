Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `m` is less than `n`, `j` is `m`, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `ans` is 1 if there are at least `k` elements in `done` otherwise it is 0, `todo` is a set of `m-i` positive integers not greater than 10^6 if there are `i` elements in `a[:m]` that are in `todo`, `done` is a set containing `i` positive integers not greater than 10^6 if there are `i` elements in `a[:m]` that are in `todo`, otherwise `todo` is a set of `m` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `done` is an empty set, `extra` is a set containing `m` positive integers not greater than 10^6 which are not in `todo`, `r` is `m`, and `old` is `a[m-1]`. Additionally, `old` is not in `extra`. The current value of `old` is in `done`.***
