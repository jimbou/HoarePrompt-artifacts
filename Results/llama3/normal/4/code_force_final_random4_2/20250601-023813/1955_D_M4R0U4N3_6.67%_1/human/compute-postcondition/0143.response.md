Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer that is less than `n`, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `j` is `m`, `ans` is 1 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0, `r` is `m`, `old` is `a[m-1]`, `todo` is empty, `done` contains all elements of `a` that were in `todo` initially and also contains `old`, `extra` contains all elements of `a` that were not in `todo` initially and does not contain `old`, `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases. The current value of `old` is in `done`.**
