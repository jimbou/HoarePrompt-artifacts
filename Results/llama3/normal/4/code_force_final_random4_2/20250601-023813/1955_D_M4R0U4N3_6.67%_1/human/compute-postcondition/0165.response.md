Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer that is less than n, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers not greater than 10^6, j is m, r is m+1, old is a[m+1]. If a[r] is in todo, then todo is empty, extra contains all elements of a that were not in todo initially except for a[m], and done contains all elements of a that were in todo initially plus a[m] and a[m+1]. If a[r] is not in todo, then extra contains all elements of a that were not in todo initially and contains a[m] and a[r] which is a[m+1], todo is empty if a[m] is not in done, otherwise todo contains a[m], and done contains all elements of a that were in todo initially. If the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k, then ans is 3, otherwise ans is 2.***
