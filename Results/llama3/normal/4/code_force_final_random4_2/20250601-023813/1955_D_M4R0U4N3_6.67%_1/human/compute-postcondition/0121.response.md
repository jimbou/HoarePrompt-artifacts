The code block consists of four lines that read input from stdin and assign values to variables. Here's the combined effect of all lines on the program:

1. `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())`: This line reads three space-separated integers from stdin and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k`, respectively. Since `n` was a positive integer, `m` was 0, and `k` was a positive integer, their values are updated to the new input values. Stdin now contains `t-4` test cases.

2. `a = list(map(int, input().split()))`: This line reads a list of space-separated integers from stdin and assigns it to `a`. Since `a` was a list of `n` positive integers not greater than 10^6, its value is updated to the new list of integers. The length of `a` is not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that it is equal to the new value of `n`. Stdin now contains `t-5` test cases.

3. `todo = set(map(int, input().split()))`: This line reads a list of space-separated integers from stdin, converts them to a set, and assigns it to `todo`. The size of the set is not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that it is equal to the number of unique integers in the input list. Stdin now contains `t-6` test cases.

4. `done = set()` and `extra = set()`: These two lines initialize empty sets `done` and `extra`, respectively.

After executing the entire code block, the final state of the variables is as follows:

* `n` is a positive integer (updated value)
* `m` is a positive integer (updated value)
* `k` is a positive integer (updated value)
* `a` is a list of `n` positive integers not greater than 10^6 (updated value)
* `j` is still 0 (no change)
* `ans` is still a positive integer (no change)
* `r` is still `n` (no change, but `n` has been updated)
* `todo` is a set of unique positive integers (newly initialized)
* `done` is an empty set (newly initialized)
* `extra` is an empty set (newly initialized)
* Stdin contains `t-6` test cases (updated value)

Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers not greater than 10^6, j is 0, ans is a positive integer, r is n, todo is a set of unique positive integers, done is an empty set, extra is an empty set, stdin contains t-6 test cases**
