To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `r`, `m`, and `n`. The loop will execute if `m` is less than `n`. Since `m` is currently 0 and `n` is a positive integer, we need to adjust `m` to be less than `n` for the loop to execute. We can set `m` to be 0 and `r` to be 0, and `n` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `n` is a positive integer that must be greater than 0, `m` is 0, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `j` is 0, `ans` is either 1 or 0, `r` is 0, stdin contains `t-4` test cases. If all elements of `a` are in `todo`, then `todo` is an empty set and `done` is a set containing all elements of `a`. Otherwise, `extra` is a set containing all elements of `a` that are not in `todo`, and `done` is a set containing all elements of `a` that are in `todo`.**
