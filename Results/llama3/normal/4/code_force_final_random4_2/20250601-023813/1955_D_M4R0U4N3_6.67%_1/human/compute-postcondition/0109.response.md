Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, n is a positive integer that must be greater than 1, m is 0, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers not greater than 10^6, j is 0, ans is either 1, 2 or 3, r is 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases, old is not in done, old is in todo, if the length of done is greater than or equal to k, then ans is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If a[r] is in todo, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. Otherwise, the element at index r of a is in extra.**

The code removes the element `old` from the set `done` and adds it to the set `todo`. This means that `old` is no longer in `done` and is now in `todo`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
