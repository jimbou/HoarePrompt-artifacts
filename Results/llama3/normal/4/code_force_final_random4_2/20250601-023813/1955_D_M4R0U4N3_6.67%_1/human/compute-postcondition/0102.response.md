Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, n is a positive integer that must be greater than 0, m is 0, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers not greater than 10^6, j is 0, ans is either 1 or 2, r is 1, stdin contains t-4 test cases. If the first element of a is in extra, then extra no longer contains the first element of a, and if the first element of a is in done, then done is a set containing all elements of a except the first one, and todo is a set containing the first element of a. If all elements of a are in todo, then todo is an empty set. The element at index r of a is in extra. If the length of done is greater than or equal to k, then ans is either 1 or 2. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the element at index r of a is added to the set extra. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to the sets done, todo, and extra are updated accordingly. The state of ans is still either 1 or 2, depending on the length of done.
