Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `j` is 1. If `a[j]` is in `todo`, then `todo` is a set of `m-2` positive integers not greater than 10^6 and `done` is a set containing one positive integer not greater than 10^6 which is `a[j]`. Otherwise, `todo` is a set of `m` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `done` is an empty set, and `extra` is a set containing two positive integers not greater than 10^6 which are not in `todo`.**
