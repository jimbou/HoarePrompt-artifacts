Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than `m+1`, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `m` is less than `n`, `j` is `m`, `ans` is either 1 or 2, `todo` is either a set of `m-i-1` positive integers not greater than 10^6 or a set of `m-i` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `done` is either a set containing `i+1` positive integers not greater than 10^6 or a set containing `i` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `extra` is either a set containing `m-2` positive integers not greater than 10^6 which are not in `todo` or a set containing `m-1` positive integers not greater than 10^6 which are not in `todo`, `r` is `m+1`, `a[r]` is either in `done` or not in `todo`, stdin contains `t-2` test cases. If `old` is in `extra`, then `extra` is updated to contain `m-2` positive integers not greater than 10^6 which are not in `todo` or `m-1` positive integers not greater than 10^6 which are not in `todo`. If `old` is not in `extra`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged if `old` is in `done`.***
