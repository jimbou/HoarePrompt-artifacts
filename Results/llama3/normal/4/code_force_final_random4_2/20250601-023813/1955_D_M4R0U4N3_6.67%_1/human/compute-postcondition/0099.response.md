Postcondition: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, n is a positive integer that must be greater than 0, m is 0, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers not greater than 10^6, j is 0, ans is either 1 or 2, r is 1, old is the first element of a, stdin contains t-4 test cases. If the first element of a is in done, then done is a set containing all elements of a except the first one, and todo is a set containing the first element of a, and extra is a set containing all elements of a that are not in todo. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
