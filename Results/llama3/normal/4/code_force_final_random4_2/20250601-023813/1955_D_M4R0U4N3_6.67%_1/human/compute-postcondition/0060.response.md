The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, stdin contains `t-2` test cases. So for the loop to be executed one more time `t` must be greater than 1 and stdin contains `t-3` test cases.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `m` is less than `n`, `j` is `m`, `ans` is either 1, 2, 3 or 4, `todo` is either a set of `m-i-j` positive integers not greater than 10^6 or a set of `m-i-j+1` positive integers not greater than 10^6 or a set of `m-i-j+2` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `done` is either a set containing `i+j` positive integers not greater than 10^6 or a set containing `i+j-1` positive integers not greater than 10^6 or a set containing `i+j-2` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `extra` is either a set containing `m-j` positive integers not greater than 10^6 which are not in `todo` and contains `a[r]` or a set containing `m-j+1` positive integers not greater than 10^6 which are not in `todo` and contains `a[r]`, `r` is `n`, `a[r]` is in `done` and not in `todo`, stdin contains `t-3` test cases.**
