Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `n` is a positive integer that must be greater than 0, `m` is 0, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `j` is 0, `ans` is either 1 or 0, `r` is 0, `old` is the first element of `a` (a[r-m] = a[0-m] = a[0]), stdin contains `t-4` test cases. If the first element of `a` is in `done`, then `done` is a set containing all elements of `a` except the first one, and `todo` is a set containing the first element of `a`, and `extra` is a set containing all elements of `a` that are not in `todo` (which is empty in this case). Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
