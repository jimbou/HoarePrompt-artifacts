The only variable in the loop head is variable `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1 and `m` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `j` is 2. If `a[j]` is in `todo`, then `todo` is a set of `m-2` positive integers not greater than 10^6 and `done` is a set containing one positive integer not greater than 10^6 which is `a[j]`. Otherwise, `todo` is a set of `m` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `done` is an empty set, and `extra` is a set containing two positive integers not greater than 10^6 which are not in `todo`.**
