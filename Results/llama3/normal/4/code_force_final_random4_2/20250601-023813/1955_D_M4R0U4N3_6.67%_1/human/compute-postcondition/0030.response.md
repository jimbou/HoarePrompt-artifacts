Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `m` is less than `n`, `j` is `m`, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `ans` is 1 if there are at least `k` elements in `done` otherwise it is 0. If `old` is in `extra`, then `todo` is a set of `m-i` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `done` is a set containing `i` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `extra` is a set containing `m` positive integers not greater than 10^6 which are not in `todo`, and `r` is `m`. If `old` is not in `extra`, then `todo` is a set of `m-i+1` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `done` is a set containing `i-1` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `extra` is a set containing `m+1` positive integers not greater than 10^6 which are not in `todo`, and `r` is `m`. Additionally, if `old` is in `done`, then `todo` is a set of `m-i+1` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `done` is a set containing `i-1` positive integers not greater than 10^6. Furthermore, `a[r]` is not in `todo`.**

In this output state, the value of `extra` has been updated to include `a[r]`, and the other variables remain unchanged. The size of `extra` has increased by 1 if `old` is not in `extra`, and the size of `todo` remains the same if `old` is in `extra`. The value of `r` is still `m`, and `a[r]` is not in `todo`.
