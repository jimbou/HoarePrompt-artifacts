Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than 2, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers not greater than 10^6, j is 2, ans is either 1, 2, 3 or 4, r is n, stdin contains t-4 test cases, todo is a set of m-4 positive integers not greater than 10^6, done is a set containing three positive integers which are the current and previous values of a[j] and another positive integer.**

In this output state, the value of `todo` has been updated to a set of `m-4` positive integers not greater than `10^6` because one element was removed from it. The value of `done` has been updated to a set containing three positive integers which are the current and previous values of `a[j]` and another positive integer because `a[j]` was added to it. No other variables have been modified.
