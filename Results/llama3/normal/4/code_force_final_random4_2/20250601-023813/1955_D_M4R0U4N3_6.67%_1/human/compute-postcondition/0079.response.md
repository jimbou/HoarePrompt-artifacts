Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `n` is a positive integer that must be greater than 0, `m` is 0, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `j` is 0, `ans` is either 1 or 0, `r` is 0, `old` is the first element of `a` (a[r-m] = a[0-m] = a[0]), stdin contains `t-4` test cases. If all elements of `a` are in `todo`, then `todo` is an empty set and `done` is a set containing all elements of `a`. Otherwise, `extra` is a set containing all elements of `a` that are not in `todo`, and `done` is a set containing all elements of `a` that are in `todo`.**

In this output state, the value of `old` has been assigned the first element of the list `a`, since `r` is 0 and `m` is 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
