The only variable in the loop head is variable `r`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `r` and `n`. If `r` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `r` is `m`, `n` is greater than `m`. For the loop to execute again, `r` must be increased by 1, so `r` is `m+1` and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than `m+1`.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than `m+1`, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `m` is less than `n`, `j` is `m`, stdin contains `t-2` test cases. If there are at least `k` elements in `done`, then `ans` is 2, `todo` is a set of `m-i-1` positive integers not greater than 10^6 if old is in extra, `todo` is a set of `m-i` positive integers not greater than 10^6 if old is not in extra, `done` is a set containing `i+1` positive integers not greater than 10^6 if old is in extra, `done` is a set containing `i` positive integers not greater than 10^6 if old is not in extra, `extra` is a set containing `m-1` positive integers not greater than 10^6 which are not in `todo` if old is in extra, `extra` is a set containing `m` positive integers not greater than 10^6 which are not in `todo` if old is not in extra, `r` is `m+1`, `a[r]` is either in `done` or not in `todo`. Otherwise, `ans` is 1**
