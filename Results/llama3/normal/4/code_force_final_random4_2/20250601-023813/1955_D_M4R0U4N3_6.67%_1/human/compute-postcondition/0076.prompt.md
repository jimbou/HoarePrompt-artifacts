Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than 1, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers not greater than 10^6, j is m, ans is either 1, 2, 3 or 4, todo is a set of m positive integers not greater than 10^6, done is an empty set, extra is an empty set, r is n, stdin contains t-4 test cases.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(m):
    if a[j] in todo:
        todo.remove(a[j])
        done.add(a[j])
    else:
        extra.add(a[j])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer greater than 1, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than 0, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers not greater than 10^6, j is 0, ans is either 1, 2, 3 or 4, if a[j] is in todo, then todo is a set of m-1 positive integers not greater than 10^6 and done is a set containing a single positive integer which is the current value of a[j], otherwise todo is a set of m positive integers not greater than 10^6 and extra is a set containing a[j], r is n, stdin contains t-4 test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than 1, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than 1, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers not greater than 10^6, j is 1, ans is either 1, 2, 3 or 4, r is n, stdin contains t-4 test cases. If a[j] is in todo, then todo is a set of m-2 positive integers not greater than 10^6 and done is a set containing two positive integers which are the current and previous values of a[j]. Otherwise, todo is a set of m-1 positive integers not greater than 10^6 and extra is a set containing a[j] and another positive integer which is the current value of a[j].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than 1, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than 2, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers not greater than 10^6, j is 2, ans is either 1, 2, 3 or 4, r is n, stdin contains t-4 test cases. If a[j] is in todo, then todo is a set of m-4 positive integers not greater than 10^6, and done is a set containing three positive integers which are the current and previous values of a[j] and another positive integer. Otherwise, extra is a set containing two positive integers which are the current and previous values of a[j], and a[j] is added to the set extra.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
