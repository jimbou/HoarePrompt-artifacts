Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `n` is a positive integer that must be greater than 1, `m` is 0, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `j` is 0, `ans` is either 1, 2 or 3, `r` is 2, stdin contains `t-4` test cases, `old` is the element at index `r-1` of `a` which is either in `done` or in `extra`. If it is in `done`, then it is not in `todo`. If it is in `extra`, then it was not in `todo` before and is now in `extra`. If the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. Otherwise, the element at index `r` of `a` is in `extra`.**

In this output state, the value of `old` is assigned the element at index `r-1` of `a`, which is either in `done` or in `extra`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
