Output: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `m` is less than `n`, `j` is `m`, `ans` is either 1, 2, 3 or 4, `todo` is either a set of `m-i-j` positive integers not greater than 10^6 or a set of `m-i-j+1` positive integers not greater than 10^6 or a set of `m-i-j+2` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `done` is either a set containing `i+j` positive integers not greater than 10^6 or a set containing `i+j-1` positive integers not greater than 10^6 or a set containing `i+j-2` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `extra` is either a set containing `m-j` positive integers not greater than 10^6 which are not in `todo` and contains `a[r]` or a set containing `m-j+1` positive integers not greater than 10^6 which are not in `todo` and contains `a[r]`, `r` is `n`, `a[r]` is in `done` and not in `todo`, stdin contains `t-2` test cases. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, then `todo` is updated to contain `m-i-j` positive integers not greater than 10^6 or `m-i-j+1` positive integers not greater than 10^6, and `done` is updated to contain `i+j` positive integers not greater than 10^6 or `i+j-1` positive integers not greater than 10^6. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, then `todo` remains unchanged, and `extra` is updated to contain `m-j+1` positive integers not greater than 10^6 which are not in `todo` and contains `a[r]`. If the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is either 3 or 4. Otherwise, `ans` is either 1 or 2. If `old` is in `done`, then `done` is either a set containing `i+j-1` positive integers not greater than 10^6 or a set containing `i+j-2` positive integers not greater than 10^6. Otherwise, no changes are made to `done`, and the value of `ans` is being printed which is either 1, 2, 3 or 4.**
