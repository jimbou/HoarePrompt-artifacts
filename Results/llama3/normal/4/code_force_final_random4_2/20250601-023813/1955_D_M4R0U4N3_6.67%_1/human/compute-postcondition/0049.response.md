Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is a positive integer greater than m+2, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers not greater than 10^6, m is less than n, j is m, ans is either 1, 2, 3 or 4, todo is either a set of m-i-2 positive integers not greater than 10^6 or a set of m-i-1 positive integers not greater than 10^6, done is either a set containing i+1 positive integers not greater than 10^6 or a set containing i positive integers not greater than 10^6, extra is either a set containing m-2 positive integers not greater than 10^6 which are not in todo or a set containing m-1 positive integers not greater than 10^6 which are not in todo and contains a[r], r is m+2, a[r] is in done and not in todo, old is a[r - m], stdin contains t-2 test cases.**

The code snippet modifies the sets `done` and `todo`. The first line removes the element `old` from the set `done`, reducing its size by 1. The second line adds the element `old` to the set `todo`, increasing its size by 1. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
