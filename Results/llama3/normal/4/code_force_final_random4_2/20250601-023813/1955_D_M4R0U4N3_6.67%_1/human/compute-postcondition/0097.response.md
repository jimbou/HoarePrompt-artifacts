Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, n is a positive integer that must be greater than 0, m is 0, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers not greater than 10^6, j is 0, ans is either 1 or 2, r is 1, old is no longer in extra, stdin contains t-4 test cases. If the first element of a is in done, then done is a set containing all elements of a except the first one, and todo is a set containing the first element of a. If all elements of a are in todo, then todo is an empty set. The element at index r of a is either in done or in extra. If it is in done, then it is not in todo. If it is in extra, then it was not in todo before and is now in extra. If the length of done is greater than or equal to k, then ans is either 1 or 2.**

The code removes the first element of list a (old) from set extra. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. The first element of a is no longer in extra. The other conditions related to the sets done, todo, and extra still hold.
