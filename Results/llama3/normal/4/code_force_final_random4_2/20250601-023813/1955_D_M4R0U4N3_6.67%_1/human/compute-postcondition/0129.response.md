Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is greater than 1, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers not greater than 10^6, j is 1, ans is a positive integer, r is n, stdin contains t-6 test cases, todo contains n-2 elements, done contains a[j], and extra is empty.**

The code snippet modifies the state of the variables `todo`, `done`, and `extra`. The first line removes `a[j]` from `todo`, reducing its size by 1, and the second line adds `a[j]` to `done`. Since `a[j]` was in `todo`, `todo` now contains `n-2` elements, and `done` contains `a[j]`. The value of `extra` remains empty. All other variables remain unchanged.
