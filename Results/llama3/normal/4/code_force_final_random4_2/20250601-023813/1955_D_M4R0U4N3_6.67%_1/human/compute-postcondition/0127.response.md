Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `j` is 0, `ans` is a positive integer, `r` is `n`, `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases. If `a[j]` is in `todo`, then `todo` contains `n-1` elements, `done` contains `a[j]`, and `extra` is empty. Otherwise, `todo` remains unchanged, `done` is empty, and `extra` contains `a[j]`.***
