Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `j` is 1, `ans` is a positive integer, `r` is `n`, `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases. If `a[j]` is in `todo`, then `todo` contains `n-1` elements, `done` contains `a[j]`, and `extra` contains `a[j]`. Otherwise, `todo` remains unchanged, `done` is empty, and `extra` contains `a[j]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `j`, `ans`, and `r` remain unchanged. The `stdin` still contains `t-6` test cases. The set `extra` now contains the element `a[j]`. If `a[j]` was already in `todo`, then `todo` still contains `n-1` elements, `done` still contains `a[j]`, and `extra` now also contains `a[j]`. If `a[j]` was not in `todo`, then `todo` remains unchanged, `done` is still empty, and `extra` now contains `a[j]`.
