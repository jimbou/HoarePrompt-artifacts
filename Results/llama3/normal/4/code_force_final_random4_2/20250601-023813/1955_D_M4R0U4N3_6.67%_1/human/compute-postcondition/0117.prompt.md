Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is 0, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `j` is 0, `ans` is either 1 or 0, `r` is `n`, stdin contains `t-4` test cases. If all elements of `a` are in `todo`, then `todo` is an empty set and `done` is a set containing all elements of `a`. Otherwise, `extra` is a set containing all elements of `a` that are not in `todo`, and `done` is a set containing all elements of `a` that are in `todo`.
Code of the loop:
for r in range(m, n):
    old = a[r - m]
    if old in extra:
        extra.remove(old)
    elif old in done:
        done.remove(old)
        todo.add(old)
    if a[r] in todo:
        todo.remove(a[r])
        done.add(a[r])
    else:
        extra.add(a[r])
    if len(done) >= k:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is a positive integer greater than 1, n is a positive integer that must be greater than 0, m is 0, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers not greater than 10^6, j is 0, ans is either 1 or 2, r is 0, old is the first element of a (a[r-m] = a[0-m] = a[0]), stdin contains t-4 test cases. If the first element of a is in extra, then extra no longer contains the first element of a (a[0]), and done is a set containing all elements of a that are in todo. If all elements of a are in todo, then todo is an empty set. If the first element of a is in done, then done is a set containing all elements of a except the first one, and todo is a set containing the first element of a, and extra is a set containing all elements of a that are not in todo (which is empty in this case). Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. The element at index r of a is either in done or in extra. If it is in done, then it is not in todo. If it is in extra, then it was not in todo before and is now in extra. If the length of done is greater than or equal to k, then ans is either 1 or 2. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `n` is a positive integer that must be greater than 0, `m` is 0, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `j` is 0, `ans` is either 1, 2 or 3, `r` is 1, stdin contains `t-4` test cases. If the first element of `a` is in `extra`, then `extra` no longer contains the first element of `a`, and if the first element of `a` is in `done`, then `done` is a set containing all elements of `a` except the first one, and `todo` is a set containing the first element of `a`. If all elements of `a` are in `todo`, then `todo` is an empty set. The element at index `r` of `a` is either in `done` or in `extra`. If it is in `done`, then it is not in `todo`. If it is in `extra`, then it was not in `todo` before and is now in `extra`. If the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. Otherwise, the element at index `r` of `a` is in `extra`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `n` is a positive integer that must be greater than 1, `m` is 0, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `j` is 0, `ans` is either 2, 3 or 4, `r` is 2, stdin contains `t-4` test cases. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, then `a[r]` is in `done`, `a[r]` is not in `todo`, and `a[r]` is in `extra`. Otherwise, the element at index `r` of `a` is in `extra`. If the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is either 2, 3 or 4. Otherwise, the state of `ans` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
