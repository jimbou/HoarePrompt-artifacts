Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer that is less than `n`, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `j` is `m`, `ans` is 1 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0, `r` is `m`. If `a[m-1]` is in `extra`, then `extra` contains all elements of `a` that were not in `todo` initially except for `a[m-1]`. Otherwise, `todo` contains `a[m-1]` if `a[m-1]` is in `done`, otherwise `todo` is empty, and `extra` contains all elements of `a` that were not in `todo` initially and does not contain `a[m-1]` if `a[m-1]` is in `done`, otherwise `extra` contains all elements of `a` that were not in `todo` initially. `done` contains all elements of `a` that were in `todo` initially, and `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases. Additionally, `a[r]` is not in `todo`.***
