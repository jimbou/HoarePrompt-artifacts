stdin contains a number of test cases t, followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of three integers n, m, and k, followed by a list of n integers a, and a list of m integers b. n, m, and k are positive integers such that k <= m <= n. The elements of a and b are positive integers not greater than 10^6.
