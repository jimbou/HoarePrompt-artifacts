Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than 2, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers not greater than 10^6, j is 2, ans is either 1, 2, 3 or 4, r is n, stdin contains t-4 test cases, extra is a set containing two positive integers which are the current and previous values of a[j], and a[j] is added to the set extra.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of t, n, m, k, a, j, ans, and r remains the same. The stdin still contains t-4 test cases. The set extra now contains two positive integers which are the current and previous values of a[j], and a[j] is added to the set extra.
