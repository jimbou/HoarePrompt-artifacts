Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer that is less than `n`, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `j` is `m`, `ans` is 1 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0, `r` is `m`, `old` is `a[m-1]`, `todo` is empty, `done` contains all elements of `a` that were in `todo` initially, `extra` contains all elements of `a` that were not in `todo` initially, `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `j`, `ans`, `r`, `todo`, `done`, `extra`, and `stdin` remain the same as in the initial state. A new variable `old` is introduced and assigned the value of `a[m-1]`, which is the (m-1)th element of the list `a`.
