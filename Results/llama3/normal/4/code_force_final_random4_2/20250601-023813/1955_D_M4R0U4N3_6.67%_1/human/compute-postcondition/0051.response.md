Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than `m+2`, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `m` is less than `n`, `j` is `m`, `ans` is either 1, 2, 3 or 4, `todo` is either a set of `m-i-2` positive integers not greater than 10^6 or a set of `m-i-1` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `done` is either a set containing `i+2` positive integers not greater than 10^6 or a set containing `i+1` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `extra` is either a set containing `m-2` positive integers not greater than 10^6 which are not in `todo` and contains `a[r]`, `r` is `m+2`, `a[r]` is in `done` and not in `todo`, `old` is `a[r - m]`, stdin contains `t-2` test cases. If `old` is in `extra`, then `todo` is updated to contain `m-i-2` positive integers not greater than 10^6 or `m-i-1` positive integers not greater than 10^6, and `done` is updated to contain `i+2` positive integers not greater than 10^6 or `i+1` positive integers not greater than 10^6. If `old` is not in `extra`, then `todo` remains unchanged, and `extra` is updated to contain `m-1` positive integers not greater than 10^6 which are not in `todo` and contains `a[r]`. If the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is either 3 or 4. Otherwise, `ans` is either 1 or 2. If `old` is in `done`, then `done` is either a set containing `i+1` positive integers not greater than 10^6 or a set containing `i` positive integers not greater than 10^6. Otherwise, no changes are made to `done`.***
