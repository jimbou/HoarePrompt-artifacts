Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `j` is `m`, `ans` is 1 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0, `r` is `n`, `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases, `todo` is empty, `done` contains all elements of `a` that were in `todo` initially, and `extra` contains all elements of `a` that were not in `todo` initially.
Code of the loop:
for r in range(m, n):
    old = a[r - m]
    if old in extra:
        extra.remove(old)
    elif old in done:
        done.remove(old)
        todo.add(old)
    if a[r] in todo:
        todo.remove(a[r])
        done.add(a[r])
    else:
        extra.add(a[r])
    if len(done) >= k:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer that is less than `n`, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `j` is `m`. If the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 2, otherwise `ans` is 1. If `a[m-1]` is in `todo`, then `r` is `m-1`, `todo` is empty, `extra` contains all elements of `a` that were not in `todo` initially except for `a[m-1]`, and `done` contains all elements of `a` that were in `todo` initially plus `a[m-1]`. Otherwise, `r` is `m`, `extra` contains all elements of `a` that were not in `todo` initially and contains `a[m-1]`, `todo` is empty if `a[m-1]` is not in `done`, otherwise `todo` contains `a[m-1]`, and `done` contains all elements of `a` that were in `todo` initially. The current value of `done` has at least `k` elements if `ans` is 2, otherwise it has less than `k` elements.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer that is less than n, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers not greater than 10^6, j is m, r is m+1, old is a[m+1]. If a[r] is in todo, then todo is empty, extra contains all elements of a that were not in todo initially except for a[m], and done contains all elements of a that were in todo initially plus a[m] and a[m+1]. If a[r] is not in todo, then extra contains all elements of a that were not in todo initially and contains a[m] and a[r] which is a[m+1], todo is empty if a[m] is not in done, otherwise todo contains a[m], and done contains all elements of a that were in todo initially. If the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k, then ans is 3, otherwise ans is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer that is less than n, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers not greater than 10^6, j is m, r is m+2, old is a[m+1]. If a[r] is in todo, then todo is empty, extra contains all elements of a that were not in todo initially except for a[m] and a[m+1], and done contains all elements of a that were in todo initially plus a[m], a[m+1], and a[m+2]. If a[r] is not in todo, then extra contains all elements of a that were not in todo initially and contains a[m] and a[r] which is a[m+2], todo is empty if a[m] is not in done, otherwise todo contains a[m], and done contains all elements of a that were in todo initially. If the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k, then ans is 4, otherwise ans is 3. If old is in done, then todo contains a[m+1].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
