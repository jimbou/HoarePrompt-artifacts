Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains a number of test cases t, followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of three integers n, m, and k, followed by a list of n integers a, and a list of m integers b. n, m, and k are positive integers such that k <= m <= n. The elements of a and b are positive integers not greater than 10^6.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    todo = set(map(int, input().split()))
    done = set()
    extra = set()
    for j in range(m):
        if a[j] in todo:
            todo.remove(a[j])
            done.add(a[j])
        else:
            extra.add(a[j])
    ans = 1 if len(done) >= k else 0
    for r in range(m, n):
        old = a[r - m]
        if old in extra:
            extra.remove(old)
        elif old in done:
            done.remove(old)
            todo.add(old)
        if a[r] in todo:
            todo.remove(a[r])
            done.add(a[r])
        else:
            extra.add(a[r])
        if len(done) >= k:
            ans += 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `m` is less than `n`, `j` is `m`, `ans` is either 1, 2, 3 or 4, `todo` is either a set of `m-i-j` positive integers not greater than 10^6 or a set of `m-i-j+1` positive integers not greater than 10^6 or a set of `m-i-j+2` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `done` is either a set containing `i+j` positive integers not greater than 10^6 or a set containing `i+j-1` positive integers not greater than 10^6 or a set containing `i+j-2` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `extra` is either a set containing `m-j` positive integers not greater than 10^6 which are not in `todo` and contains `a[r]` or a set containing `m-j+1` positive integers not greater than 10^6 which are not in `todo` and contains `a[r]`, `r` is `n`, `a[r]` is in `done` and not in `todo`, stdin contains `t-2` test cases. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, then `todo` is updated to contain `m-i-j` positive integers not greater than 10^6 or `m-i-j+1` positive integers not greater than 10^6, and `done` is updated to contain `i+j` positive integers not greater than 10^6 or `i+j-1` positive integers not greater than 10^6. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, then `todo` remains unchanged, and `extra` is updated to contain `m-j+1` positive integers not greater than 10^6 which are not in `todo` and contains `a[r]`. If the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is either 3 or 4. Otherwise, `ans` is either 1 or 2. If `old` is in `done`, then `done` is either a set containing `i+j-1` positive integers not greater than 10^6 or a set containing `i+j-2` positive integers not greater than 10^6. Otherwise, no changes are made to `done`, and the value of `ans` is being printed which is either 1, 2, 3 or 4.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is a positive integer greater than 1, n is a positive integer, m is 0, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers not greater than 10^6, j is 0, ans is a positive integer, r is n, stdin contains t-4 test cases. If all elements of a are in todo, then todo is an empty set and done is a set containing all elements of a. Otherwise, extra is a set containing all elements of a that are not in todo, and done is a set containing all elements of a that are in todo, and ans is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer that is less than n, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers not greater than 10^6, j is m, r is n, ans is the number of times the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k, extra contains all elements of a that were not in todo initially and contains all elements of a that were in todo initially but were removed from done, todo is empty if a[n-1] is not in done, otherwise todo contains a[n-1], and done contains all elements of a that were in todo initially and were not removed from done, and the number of times the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
