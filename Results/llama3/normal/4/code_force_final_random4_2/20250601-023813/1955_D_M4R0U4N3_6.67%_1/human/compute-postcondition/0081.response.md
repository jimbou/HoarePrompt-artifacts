Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `n` is a positive integer that must be greater than 0, `m` is 0, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `j` is 0, `ans` is either 1 or 0, `r` is 0, `old` is the first element of `a` (a[r-m] = a[0-m] = a[0]), stdin contains `t-4` test cases. The set `extra` no longer contains the first element of `a` (a[0]), and `done` is a set containing all elements of `a` that are in `todo`. If all elements of `a` are in `todo`, then `todo` is an empty set.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the set `extra` no longer contains the first element of the list `a`, which is `a[0]`. The other variables and sets remain unchanged.
