The only variable in the loop head is variable  j, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `m` must be greater than 1.
State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than 1, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers not greater than 10^6, j is 1, ans is either 1, 2, 3 or 4, if a[j] is in todo, then todo is a set of m-1 positive integers not greater than 10^6 and done is a set containing a single positive integer which is the current value of a[j], otherwise todo is a set of m positive integers not greater than 10^6 and extra is a set containing a[j], r is n, stdin contains t-4 test cases.**
