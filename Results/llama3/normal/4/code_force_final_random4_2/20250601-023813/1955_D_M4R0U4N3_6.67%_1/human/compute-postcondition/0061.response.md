Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers not greater than 10^6, j is m, ans is either 1, 2, 3 or 4, todo is a set of m positive integers not greater than 10^6, done is an empty set, extra is an empty set, r is n, stdin contains t-4 test cases.**

The code reads three positive integers n, m, and k from the input and assigns them to the variables n, m, and k, respectively. It then reads a list of n positive integers not greater than 10^6 and assigns it to the variable a. The variable todo is assigned a set of m positive integers not greater than 10^6 from the input. The variables done and extra are initialized as empty sets. The variable r is assigned the value of n. The input is consumed by t-4 test cases.
