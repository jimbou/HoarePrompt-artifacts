Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer that is less than `n`, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `j` is `m`, `ans` is 1 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0. If `a[m-1]` is in `todo`, then `r` is `m-1`, `todo` is empty, `extra` contains all elements of `a` that were not in `todo` initially except for `a[m-1]`, and `done` contains all elements of `a` that were in `todo` initially plus `a[m-1]`. Otherwise, `r` is `m`, `extra` contains all elements of `a` that were not in `todo` initially and contains `a[m-1]`, `todo` is empty if `a[m-1]` is not in `done`, otherwise `todo` contains `a[m-1]`, and `done` contains all elements of `a` that were in `todo` initially. The current value of `done` has at least `k` elements.**
