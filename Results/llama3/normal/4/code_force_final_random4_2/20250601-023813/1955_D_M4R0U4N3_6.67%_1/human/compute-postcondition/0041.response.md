Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is a positive integer greater than m+1, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers not greater than 10^6, m is less than n, j is m, ans is either 1 or 2, todo is either a set of m-i-2 positive integers not greater than 10^6 or a set of m-i-1 positive integers not greater than 10^6, done is either a set containing i+2 positive integers not greater than 10^6 or a set containing i+1 positive integers not greater than 10^6, extra is either a set containing m-2 positive integers not greater than 10^6 which are not in todo or a set containing m-1 positive integers not greater than 10^6 which are not in todo, r is m+1, a[r] is in done and not in todo, stdin contains t-2 test cases.**

The code removes `a[r]` from `todo` and adds it to `done`. Since `a[r]` is either in `done` or not in `todo` initially, this operation does not change the state of `extra`. The number of elements in `todo` decreases by 1, and the number of elements in `done` increases by 1. The value of `r` remains unchanged. The state of the other variables remains the same as in the initial state.
