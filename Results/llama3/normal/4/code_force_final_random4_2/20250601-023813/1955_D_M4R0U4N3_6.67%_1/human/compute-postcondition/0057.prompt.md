Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `j` is `m`, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `ans` is 1 if there are at least `k` elements in `done` otherwise it is 0, `todo` is a set of `m-i` positive integers not greater than 10^6 if there are `i` elements in `a[:m]` that are in `todo`, `done` is a set containing `i` positive integers not greater than 10^6 if there are `i` elements in `a[:m]` that are in `todo`, otherwise `todo` is a set of `m` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `done` is an empty set, and `extra` is a set containing `m` positive integers not greater than 10^6 which are not in `todo`.
Code of the loop:
for r in range(m, n):
    old = a[r - m]
    if old in extra:
        extra.remove(old)
    elif old in done:
        done.remove(old)
        todo.add(old)
    if a[r] in todo:
        todo.remove(a[r])
        done.add(a[r])
    else:
        extra.add(a[r])
    if len(done) >= k:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `m` is less than `n`, `j` is `m`, stdin contains `t-2` test cases. If there are at least `k` elements in `done`, then `ans` is 2, `todo` is a set of `m-i-1` positive integers not greater than 10^6 if old is in extra, `todo` is a set of `m-i` positive integers not greater than 10^6 if old is not in extra, `done` is a set containing `i+1` positive integers not greater than 10^6 if old is in extra, `done` is a set containing `i` positive integers not greater than 10^6 if old is not in extra, `extra` is a set containing `m-1` positive integers not greater than 10^6 which are not in `todo` if old is in extra, `extra` is a set containing `m` positive integers not greater than 10^6 which are not in `todo` if old is not in extra, `r` is `m`, `a[r]` is either in `done` or not in `todo`. Otherwise, `ans` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than `m+1`, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `m` is less than `n`, `j` is `m`, `ans` is either 1, 2, 3 or 4, `todo` is either a set of `m-i-2` positive integers not greater than 10^6 or a set of `m-i-1` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `done` is either a set containing `i+2` positive integers not greater than 10^6 or a set containing `i+1` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `extra` is either a set containing `m-2` positive integers not greater than 10^6 which are not in `todo` or a set containing `m-1` positive integers not greater than 10^6 which are not in `todo` and contains `a[r]`, `r` is `m+1`, `a[r]` is in `done` and not in `todo`, stdin contains `t-2` test cases. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, then `todo` is updated to contain `m-i-2` positive integers not greater than 10^6 or `m-i-1` positive integers not greater than 10^6, and `done` is updated to contain `i+2` positive integers not greater than 10^6 or `i+1` positive integers not greater than 10^6. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, then `todo` remains unchanged, and `extra` is updated to contain `m-1` positive integers not greater than 10^6 which are not in `todo` and contains `a[r]`. If the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is either 3 or 4. Otherwise, `ans` is either 1 or 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than `m+2`, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `m` is less than `n`, `j` is `m`, `ans` is either 1, 2, 3 or 4, `todo` is either a set of `m-i-3` positive integers not greater than 10^6 or a set of `m-i-2` positive integers not greater than 10^6 or a set of `m-i-1` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `done` is either a set containing `i+3` positive integers not greater than 10^6 or a set containing `i+2` positive integers not greater than 10^6 or a set containing `i+1` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `extra` is either a set containing `m-2` positive integers not greater than 10^6 which are not in `todo` and contains `a[r]` or a set containing `m-1` positive integers not greater than 10^6 which are not in `todo` and contains `a[r]`, `r` is `m+2`, `a[r]` is in `done` and not in `todo`, `old` is `a[r - m]`. If `old` is in `extra`, then `todo` is updated to contain `m-i-2` positive integers not greater than 10^6 or `m-i-1` positive integers not greater than 10^6, and `done` is updated to contain `i+2` positive integers not greater than 10^6 or `i+1` positive integers not greater than 10^6. If `old` is not in `extra`, then `todo` remains unchanged, and `extra` is updated to contain `m-1` positive integers not greater than 10^6 which are not in `todo` and contains `a[r]`. If the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is either 3 or 4. Otherwise, `ans` is either 1 or 2. If `old` is in `done`, then `done` is either a set containing `i+1` positive integers not greater than 10^6 or a set containing `i` positive integers not greater than 10^6. Otherwise, no changes are made to `done`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
