To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `m`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `m`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0, and `m` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 1. The value of `m` remains the same.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `j` is 1, `ans` is a positive integer, `r` is `n`, `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases. If `a[j]` is in `todo`, then `todo` contains `n-1` elements, `done` contains `a[j]`, and `extra` is empty. Otherwise, `todo` remains unchanged, `done` is empty, and `extra` contains `a[j]`.**
