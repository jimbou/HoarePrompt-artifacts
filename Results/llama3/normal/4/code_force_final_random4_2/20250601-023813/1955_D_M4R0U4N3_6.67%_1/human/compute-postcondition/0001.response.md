Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer such that k <= m <= n, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers not greater than 10^6, todo is a set of m positive integers not greater than 10^6, done is an empty set, extra is an empty set, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of t remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The values of n, m, and k are assigned from the input and are positive integers with the constraint that k <= m <= n. The list a contains n positive integers not greater than 10^6. The set todo contains m positive integers not greater than 10^6. The sets done and extra are empty as they are initialized as such. Stdin now contains t-1 test cases as one test case has been processed.
