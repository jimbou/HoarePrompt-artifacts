The code adds the element at index `j` of list `a` to the set `extra`. The element at index `j` of `a` is not in the set `todo`. The values of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `todo` is a set of `m` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `done` is an empty set, `extra` is a set containing one positive integer not greater than 10^6 which is not in `todo`, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `j` is 0.**
