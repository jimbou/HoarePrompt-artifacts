Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 2, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `j` is 2, `ans` is a positive integer, `r` is `n`, `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases. If `a[j]` is in `todo`, then `todo` contains `n-2` elements, `done` contains `a[j]`, and `extra` contains `a[j]`. Otherwise, `todo` remains unchanged, `done` is empty, and `extra` contains `a[j]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `j`, `ans`, and `r` remain unchanged. The value of `extra` is updated to include `a[j]`. If `a[j]` is in `todo`, then `done` contains `a[j]` and `extra` also contains `a[j]`. Otherwise, `done` is empty and `extra` contains `a[j]`. The number of test cases in `stdin` remains `t-6`.
