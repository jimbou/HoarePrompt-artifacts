Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `n` is a positive integer that must be greater than 1, `m` is 0, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `j` is 0, `ans` is either 1, 2 or 3, `r` is 2, stdin contains `t-4` test cases. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, then `a[r]` is in `done`, `a[r]` is not in `todo`, and `a[r]` is in `extra`. Otherwise, the element at index `r` of `a` is in `extra`.***
