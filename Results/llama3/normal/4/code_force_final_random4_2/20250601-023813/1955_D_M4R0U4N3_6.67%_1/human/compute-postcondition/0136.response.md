Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `j` is `m`, `ans` is a positive integer, `r` is `n`, `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases. `todo` is empty, `done` contains all elements of `a` that were in `todo` initially, and `extra` contains all elements of `a` that were not in `todo` initially.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the state of the variables not affected by the loop remains unchanged. The loop counter `j` reaches its final value `m`, and the sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra` are updated based on the elements of the list `a`. Specifically, `todo` becomes empty, `done` contains all elements of `a` that were initially in `todo`, and `extra` contains all elements of `a` that were not initially in `todo`.
