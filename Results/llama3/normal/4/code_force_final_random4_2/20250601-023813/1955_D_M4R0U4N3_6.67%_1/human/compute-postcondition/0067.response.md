Postcondition: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than 0, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers not greater than 10^6, j is 0, ans is either 1, 2, 3 or 4, if a[j] is in todo, then todo is a set of m-1 positive integers not greater than 10^6 and done is a set containing a single positive integer which is the current value of a[j], otherwise todo is a set of m positive integers not greater than 10^6 and extra is a set containing a[j], r is n, stdin contains t-4 test cases.**
