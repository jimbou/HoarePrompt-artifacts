Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer that is less than n, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers not greater than 10^6, j is m, r is m+2, old is a[m+1], todo is empty, extra contains all elements of a that were not in todo initially except for a[m] and a[m+1], done contains all elements of a that were in todo initially plus a[m], a[m+1], and a[m+2]. If the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k, then ans is 3, otherwise ans is 2. If old is in done, then todo contains a[m+1].**

In this final state, the code has removed a[r] from todo and added it to done. Since a[r] is a[m+2], it has been moved from todo to done. The value of todo is now empty. The value of extra remains the same, containing all elements of a that were not in todo initially except for a[m] and a[m+1]. The value of done has been updated to include a[m], a[m+1], and a[m+2]. The value of ans depends on the number of elements in done, which is now greater than or equal to k. If it is, then ans is 3, otherwise ans is 2. If old is in done, then todo contains a[m+1].
