Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than 0, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers not greater than 10^6, todo is a set of m-1 positive integers not greater than 10^6, done is a set containing one positive integer not greater than 10^6, extra is an empty set, stdin contains t-1 test cases, j is 0.**

The code removes the current value of `a[j]` from the set `todo` and adds it to the set `done`. This means that the size of `todo` decreases by 1, and the size of `done` increases by 1. The value of `a[j]` is now in the set `done`. The value of `j` remains 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
