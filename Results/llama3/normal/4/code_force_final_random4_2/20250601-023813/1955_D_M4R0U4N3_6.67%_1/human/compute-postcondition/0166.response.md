The only variable in the loop head is variable  r, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `r` and `n`. If `r` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `r` is `m+1`, `n` is greater than `m+1`. For the loop to execute again `r` must be increased by 1 so `r` is `m+2` and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than `m+2`.
State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer that is less than n, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers not greater than 10^6, j is m, r is m+2, old is a[m+1]. If a[r] is in todo, then todo is empty, extra contains all elements of a that were not in todo initially except for a[m], and done contains all elements of a that were in todo initially plus a[m] and a[m+1]. If a[r] is not in todo, then extra contains all elements of a that were not in todo initially and contains a[m] and a[r] which is a[m+1], todo is empty if a[m] is not in done, otherwise todo contains a[m], and done contains all elements of a that were in todo initially. If the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k, then ans is 3, otherwise ans is 2.**
