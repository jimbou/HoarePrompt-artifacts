The only variable in the loop head is variable _ and input, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than the number of test cases, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is t-4, t is a positive integer greater than 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time _ must be t-3 and stdin contains t-3 test cases.
State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, n is a positive integer, m is 0, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers not greater than 10^6, j is 0, ans is a positive integer, r is n, stdin contains t-3 test cases**
