Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is greater than 2, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers not greater than 10^6, j is 2, ans is a positive integer, r is n, stdin contains t-6 test cases, todo contains n-3 elements, done contains a[j], and extra is empty.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `j`, `ans`, and `r` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `t` is also not affected as it is not used in the code. The `stdin` still contains `t-6` test cases as no input is read or modified.

The code modifies the `todo`, `done`, and `extra` variables. The first line removes `a[j]` from `todo`, reducing its size by 1, making it contain `n-3` elements. The second line adds `a[j]` to `done`, making it contain `a[j]`. The `extra` list remains empty as it is not modified by the code.
