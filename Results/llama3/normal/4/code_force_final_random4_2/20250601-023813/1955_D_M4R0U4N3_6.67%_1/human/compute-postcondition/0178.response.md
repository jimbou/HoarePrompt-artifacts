The code prints the value of `ans`, which is the number of times the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`. 

Since the exact values of `k` and the elements in `done` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the count of times the condition was met.

Output: **ans (where ans is the number of times the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k)**
