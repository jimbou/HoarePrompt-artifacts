Postcondition: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, n is a positive integer that must be greater than 0, m is 0, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers not greater than 10^6, j is 0, ans is either 1 or 0, r is 0, old is the first element of a (a[r-m] = a[0-m] = a[0]), stdin contains t-4 test cases. If the first element of a is in extra, then extra no longer contains the first element of a (a[0]), and done is a set containing all elements of a that are in todo. If all elements of a are in todo, then todo is an empty set. If the first element of a is in done, then done is a set containing all elements of a except the first one, and todo is a set containing the first element of a, and extra is a set containing all elements of a that are not in todo (which is empty in this case). Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. The element at index r of a is either in done or in extra. If it is in done, then it is not in todo. If it is in extra, then it was not in todo before and is now in extra. The current value of the length of done is greater than or equal to k.**
