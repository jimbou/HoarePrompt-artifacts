Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `n` is a positive integer that must be greater than 1, `m` is 0, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `j` is 0, `ans` is either 1, 2 or 3, `r` is 2, stdin contains `t-4` test cases. If `old` is in `extra`, then `old` is not in `extra` anymore. If `old` is in `done`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `old` is not in `done` and not in `extra`, then `old` is in `todo` and if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. The element at index `r` of `a` is in `extra`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `j`, `r`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The element at index `r` of `a` is added to the set `extra`. The state of the variables `old`, `done`, and `todo` remains unchanged, with the same conditions applying as before. The number of test cases in stdin remains `t-4`.
