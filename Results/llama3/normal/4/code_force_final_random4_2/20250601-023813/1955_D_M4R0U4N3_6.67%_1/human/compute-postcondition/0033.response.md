Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `m` is less than `n`, `j` is `m`, `ans` is 2 if there are at least `k` elements in `done` otherwise it is 1, stdin contains `t-2` test cases, `todo` is a set of `m-i-1` positive integers not greater than 10^6 if old is in extra, `todo` is a set of `m-i` positive integers not greater than 10^6 if old is not in extra, `done` is a set containing `i+1` positive integers not greater than 10^6 if old is in extra, `done` is a set containing `i` positive integers not greater than 10^6 if old is not in extra, `extra` is a set containing `m-1` positive integers not greater than 10^6 which are not in `todo` if old is in extra, `extra` is a set containing `m` positive integers not greater than 10^6 which are not in `todo` if old is not in extra, `r` is `m`, `a[r]` is either in `done` or not in `todo`.**

The value of `ans` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 2 if there are at least `k` elements in `done`, otherwise it remains 1. The values of the other variables are not affected.
