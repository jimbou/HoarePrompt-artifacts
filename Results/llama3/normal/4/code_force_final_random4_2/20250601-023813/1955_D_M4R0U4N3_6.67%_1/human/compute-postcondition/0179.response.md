Output: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer that is less than n, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers not greater than 10^6, j is m, r is n, ans is the number of times the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k, extra contains all elements of a that were not in todo initially and contains all elements of a that were in todo initially but were removed from done, todo is empty if a[n-1] is not in done, otherwise todo contains a[n-1], and done contains all elements of a that were in todo initially and were not removed from done, and the number of times the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k is printed**
