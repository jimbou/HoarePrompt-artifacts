Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer that is less than n, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers not greater than 10^6, j is m, r is m+1, old is a[m+1], todo is empty, extra contains all elements of a that were not in todo initially except for a[m], done contains all elements of a that were in todo initially plus a[m] and a[m+1]. If the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k, then ans is 2, otherwise ans is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `j`, and `r` remains unchanged. The value of `old` is updated to `a[m+1]`. The `todo` list is now empty. The `extra` list contains all elements of `a` that were not in `todo` initially, except for `a[m]`. The `done` list now contains all elements of `a` that were in `todo` initially, plus `a[m]` and `a[m+1]`. The value of `ans` is determined by the number of elements in `done`, which is now greater than or equal to `k` if `ans` is 2, otherwise it is 1.
