Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer that is less than `n`, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `j` is `m`, `r` is `m+1`, `old` is `a[m+1]`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, then `todo` is empty, `extra` contains all elements of `a` that were not in `todo` initially except for `a[m]`, and `done` contains all elements of `a` that were in `todo` initially plus `a[m]` and `a[m+1]`. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, then `extra` contains all elements of `a` that were not in `todo` initially and contains `a[m]` and `a[r]` which is `a[m+1]`, `todo` is empty if `a[m]` is not in `done`, otherwise `todo` contains `a[m]`, and `done` contains all elements of `a` that were in `todo` initially. `ans` is either 2 or 3, where if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 3, otherwise `ans` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1. If the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is now 3, otherwise `ans` is now 2. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
