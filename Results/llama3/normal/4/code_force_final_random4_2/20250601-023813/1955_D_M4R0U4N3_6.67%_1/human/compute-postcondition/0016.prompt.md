Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer such that k <= m <= n, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers not greater than 10^6, todo is a set of m positive integers not greater than 10^6, done is an empty set, extra is an empty set, stdin contains t-1 test cases.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(m):
    if a[j] in todo:
        todo.remove(a[j])
        done.add(a[j])
    else:
        extra.add(a[j])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `j` is 0. If `a[j]` is in `todo`, then `todo` is a set of `m-1` positive integers not greater than 10^6 and `done` is a set containing one positive integer not greater than 10^6. Otherwise, `todo` is a set of `m` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `done` is an empty set, and `extra` is a set containing one positive integer not greater than 10^6 which is not in `todo`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `j` is 1. If `a[j]` is in `todo`, then `todo` is a set of `m-2` positive integers not greater than 10^6 and `done` is a set containing one positive integer not greater than 10^6 which is `a[j]`. Otherwise, `todo` is a set of `m` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `done` is an empty set, and `extra` is a set containing two positive integers not greater than 10^6 which are not in `todo`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than 1, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers not greater than 10^6, stdin contains t-1 test cases, j is 2. If a[j] is in todo, then todo is a set of m-3 positive integers not greater than 10^6 and done is a set containing one positive integer not greater than 10^6 which is a[j]. Otherwise, todo is a set of m positive integers not greater than 10^6, done is an empty set, and extra is a set containing three positive integers not greater than 10^6 which are not in todo and include a[j].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
