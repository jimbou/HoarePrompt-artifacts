Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than 0, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers not greater than 10^6, j is 0, ans is either 1, 2, 3 or 4, todo is a set of m-1 positive integers not greater than 10^6, done is a set containing a single positive integer which is the current value of a[j], extra is an empty set, r is n, stdin contains t-4 test cases.**

The code removes the current value of `a[j]` from the set `todo` and adds it to the set `done`. As a result, the size of `todo` decreases by 1, and `done` now contains a single positive integer, which is the current value of `a[j]`. No other variables are affected by the code.
