Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer that is less than n, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers not greater than 10^6, j is m, ans is 1 if the number of elements in done is greater than or equal to k, otherwise ans is 0, r is m-1, todo is empty, extra contains all elements of a that were not in todo initially except for a[m-1], and done contains all elements of a that were in todo initially plus a[m-1]. stdin contains t-6 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `r` has been decremented by 1 due to the second line of the code. The `todo` list is now empty because the first line removed the current value of `a[r]` from it. The `done` set now contains all elements of `a` that were in `todo` initially, plus the element `a[m-1]` that was added by the second line. The `extra` set contains all elements of `a` that were not in `todo` initially, except for `a[m-1]`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `j`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The `stdin` still contains `t-6` test cases.
