Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `m` is less than `n`, `j` is `m`, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `ans` is 1 if there are at least `k` elements in `done` otherwise it is 0. If `old` is in `extra`, then `todo` is a set of `m-i` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `done` is a set containing `i` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `extra` is a set containing `m-1` positive integers not greater than 10^6 which are not in `todo`, and `r` is `m`. If `old` is not in `extra`, then `todo` is a set of `m-i+1` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `done` is a set containing `i-1` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `extra` is a set containing `m` positive integers not greater than 10^6 which are not in `todo`, and `r` is `m`. Additionally, if `old` is in `done`, then `todo` is a set of `m-i+1` positive integers not greater than 10^6, `done` is a set containing `i-1` positive integers not greater than 10^6. Furthermore, `a[r]` is not in `todo`.***
