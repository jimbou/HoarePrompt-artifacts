Output: **t is at least 2, k is the original value of k, L is a list of three integers, M is a sorted list of integers, q is the ceiling of k divided by the minimum of the original value of m and k, _ is 1. If n * m equals k, then n is q, m is the minimum of the original value of m and k, N is a list of q integers from the sorted list M, and cost is m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2). Otherwise, n is q-1, m is the minimum of the original value of m and k, N is a list of q-1 integers from the sorted list M, w is an integer, mu is k - (q - 1) * m, and cost is mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((q - 2) * (q - 3) // 2) + (q - 1) * m * mu. The cost is printed.**
