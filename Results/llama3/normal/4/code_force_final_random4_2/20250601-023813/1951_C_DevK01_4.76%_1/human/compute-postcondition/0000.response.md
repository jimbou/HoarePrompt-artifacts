Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains three integers n, m, and k (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, 1 <= m <= 10^9, 1 <= k <= min(n*m, 10^9)). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).**

In this output state, the value of `t` is a positive integer, which is the number of test cases minus one. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but one test case has been read and processed. Each test case still contains two lines, with the first line containing three integers n, m, and k, and the second line containing n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.
