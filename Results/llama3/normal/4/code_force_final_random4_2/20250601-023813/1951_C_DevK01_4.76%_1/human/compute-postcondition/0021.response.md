Output State: **t is at least 3, k is the original value of k, L is a list of three integers, M is a sorted list of integers, q is the ceiling of k divided by the minimum of the original value of m and k, _ is 2, n is the length of the list N, m is the minimum of the original value of m and k, N is a list of q integers from the sorted list M, cost is m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)**

The value of cost is calculated by multiplying the minimum of the original value of m and k (m) with the sum of the list N, and adding the result of multiplying m with itself and then with the sum of the first n-1 positive integers (which is (n-1)*n//2). The values of the other variables are not affected.
