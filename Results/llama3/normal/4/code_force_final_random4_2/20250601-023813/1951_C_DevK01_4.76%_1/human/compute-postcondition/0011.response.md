The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is not specified, `t` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again `_` must be 1 and `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **t is at least 2, n is the length of the list N, m is the minimum of the original value of m and k, k is the original value of k, L is a list of three integers, M is a sorted list of integers, N is a list of q integers from the sorted list M, q is the ceiling of k divided by the minimum of the original value of m and k, _ is 1**
