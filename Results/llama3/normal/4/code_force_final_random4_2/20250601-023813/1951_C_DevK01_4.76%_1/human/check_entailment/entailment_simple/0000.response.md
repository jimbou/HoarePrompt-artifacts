Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of days `n`, the maximum number of tickets that can be purchased per day `m`, and the total number of tickets to be purchased `k`.
3. It then reads the prices of tickets for each day `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` and sorts them in ascending order.
4. The program calculates the minimum number of days `q` required to purchase `k` tickets, which is the ceiling of `k/m`.
5. It then calculates the cost of purchasing `k` tickets by considering two cases:
	* If `n*m` is equal to `k`, it means that we can purchase all `k` tickets in `n` days, and the cost is simply `m` times the sum of the prices of the first `n` days, plus the additional cost due to the price increase.
	* If `n*m` is not equal to `k`, it means that we need to purchase some tickets on the last day, and the cost is calculated accordingly.
6. The program prints the calculated cost for each test case.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases. The use of `math.ceil` to calculate `q` ensures that we consider the minimum number of days required to purchase `k` tickets. The calculation of the cost is also correct, taking into account the price increase due to the purchase of tickets.

Correctness: **True**
