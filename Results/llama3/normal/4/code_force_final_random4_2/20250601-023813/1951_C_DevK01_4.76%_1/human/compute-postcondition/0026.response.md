Output State: **The program continues to the next iteration of the loop, all variables remain unchanged, t is at least 3, k is the original value of k, L is a list of three integers, M is a sorted list of integers, q is the ceiling of k divided by the minimum of the original value of m and k, _ is 2, m is the minimum of the original value of m and k, N is a list of q integers from the sorted list M if n * m equals k, otherwise N is a list of q-1 integers from the sorted list M. If n * m equals k, cost is m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2). Otherwise, mu is k - (q - 1) * m, w is the last integer popped from N, and cost is mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((q - 2) * (q - 3) // 2) + (q - 1) * m * mu. The cost is printed.**

In natural language, the program skips the current iteration and moves on to the next one, without modifying any of the variables. All the conditions and values of the variables remain the same as before.
