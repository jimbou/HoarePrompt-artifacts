Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, m, and k, and the second line contains n integers. The function calculates the cost for each test case based on the given integers and prints the cost. The cost calculation involves sorting the integers, selecting a subset of them, and performing arithmetic operations. The function processes all test cases and prints the corresponding costs.**
