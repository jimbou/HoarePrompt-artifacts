Output State: **t is at least 2, n is q, m is the minimum of the original value of m and k, k is the original value of k, L is a list of three integers, M is a sorted list of integers, N is a list of q integers from the sorted list M, q is the ceiling of k divided by the minimum of the original value of m and k, _ is 1, cost is m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)**

The code calculates the value of `cost` based on the values of `m`, `n`, and `N`. Since `n` is equal to `q`, we can substitute `q` for `n` in the calculation. The value of `cost` is then `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((q - 1) * q // 2)`. The other variables remain unchanged.
