Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains three integers n, m, and k (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, 1 <= m <= 10^9, 1 <= k <= min(n*m, 10^9)). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    L = list(map(int, input().split()))
    M = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n, m, k = L[0], L[1], L[2]
    m = min(m, k)
    M.sort()
    q = int(math.ceil(k / m))
    N = M[:q]
    n = len(N)
    if n * m == k:
        cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)
    else:
        w = N.pop()
        mu = k - (n - 1) * m
        cost = mu * w
        n = len(N)
        cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu
    print(cost)
    continue


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is at least 1, n is the length of the list N, m is the minimum of the original value of m and k, k is the original value of k, L is a list of three integers, M is a sorted list of integers, N is a list of q integers from the sorted list M, q is the ceiling of k divided by the minimum of the original value of m and k. If n times m equals k, then cost is m times the sum of the integers in N plus m squared times the sum of the integers from 1 to n-1. Otherwise, n is the length of the list N minus 1, the product of n and m is not equal to k, w is the last integer from the list N, mu is k minus (n-1) times m, and cost is mu times w plus m times the sum of N plus m squared times the sum of integers from 1 to n-2 plus n times m times mu, and the cost is printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is at least 2, k is the original value of k, L is a list of three integers, M is a sorted list of integers, q is the ceiling of k divided by the minimum of the original value of m and k, _ is 1. If n * m equals k, then n is q, m is the minimum of the original value of m and k, N is a list of q integers from the sorted list M, and cost is m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2). Otherwise, n is q-1, m is the minimum of the original value of m and k, N is a list of q-1 integers from the sorted list M, w is an integer, mu is k - (q - 1) * m, and cost is mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((q - 2) * (q - 3) // 2) + (q - 1) * m * mu. The cost is printed and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The program continues to the next iteration of the loop, all variables remain unchanged, t is at least 3, k is the original value of k, L is a list of three integers, M is a sorted list of integers, q is the ceiling of k divided by the minimum of the original value of m and k, _ is 2, m is the minimum of the original value of m and k, N is a list of q integers from the sorted list M if n * m equals k, otherwise N is a list of q-1 integers from the sorted list M. If n * m equals k, cost is m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2). Otherwise, mu is k - (q - 1) * m, w is the last integer popped from N, and cost is mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((q - 2) * (q - 3) // 2) + (q - 1) * m * mu. The cost is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
