Output State: **t is at least 1, n is the length of the list N minus 1, m is the minimum of the original value of m and k, k is the original value of k, L is a list of three integers, M is a sorted list of integers, N is a list of q-1 integers from the sorted list M, q is the ceiling of k divided by the minimum of the original value of m and k, the product of n and m is not equal to k, w is the last integer from the list N, mu is k minus (n-1) times m, cost is mu times w plus m times the sum of N plus m squared times the sum of integers from 1 to n-2 plus n times m times mu.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `n`, `N`, `w`, `mu`, and `cost`. The value of `n` is updated to be the length of the list `N` minus 1, since one element is removed from `N` by the `pop()` operation. The list `N` is also updated by removing its last element, which is assigned to the variable `w`. The variable `mu` is calculated as `k` minus `(n-1)` times `m`, and the variable `cost` is calculated based on the values of `mu`, `w`, `m`, and `N`. The other variables, including `t`, `k`, `L`, `M`, and `q`, remain unchanged.
