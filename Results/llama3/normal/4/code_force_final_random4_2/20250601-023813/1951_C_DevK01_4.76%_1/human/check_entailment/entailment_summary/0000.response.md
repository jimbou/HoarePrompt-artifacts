Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases, t, and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of sale days, n, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, m, and the number of tickets to be bought, k.
3. It then reads the prices per ticket for each of the upcoming n days and stores them in the list M.
4. The program sorts the prices in ascending order and selects the first q prices, where q is the ceiling of k/m. This is because the optimal strategy is to buy tickets on the days with the lowest prices.
5. If the total number of tickets that can be bought on these q days is equal to k, the program calculates the cost by multiplying the sum of the prices by m and adding the additional cost due to the price increase.
6. If the total number of tickets that can be bought on these q days is less than k, the program calculates the cost by buying the remaining tickets on the last day and adding the additional cost due to the price increase.
7. The program prints the calculated cost for each test case.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when k is less than or equal to m, and when the number of sale days is less than or equal to k/m.

Correctness: **True**
