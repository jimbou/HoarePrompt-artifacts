Postcondition: ***t is at least 3, k is the original value of k, L is a list of three integers, M is a sorted list of integers, q is the ceiling of k divided by the minimum of the original value of m and k, _ is 2, m is the minimum of the original value of m and k, N is a list of q integers from the sorted list M if n * m equals k, otherwise N is a list of q-1 integers from the sorted list M. If n * m equals k, cost is m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2). Otherwise, mu is k - (q - 1) * m, w is the last integer popped from N, and cost is mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((q - 2) * (q - 3) // 2) + (q - 1) * m * mu.***
