Postcondition: ***t is at least 1, n is the length of the list N, m is the minimum of the original value of m and k, k is the original value of k, L is a list of three integers, M is a sorted list of integers, N is a list of q integers from the sorted list M, q is the ceiling of k divided by the minimum of the original value of m and k. If n times m equals k, then cost is m times the sum of the integers in N plus m squared times the sum of the integers from 1 to n-1. Otherwise, n is the length of the list N minus 1, the product of n and m is not equal to k, w is the last integer from the list N, mu is k minus (n-1) times m, and cost is mu times w plus m times the sum of N plus m squared times the sum of integers from 1 to n-2 plus n times m times mu.***
