Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, m, and k, and the second line contains n integers.
2.  The program correctly calculates the cost for each test case. It first sorts the integers in ascending order, then selects a subset of them based on the value of q, which is calculated as the ceiling of k/m. This is because the program wants to buy k tickets in the cheapest possible way, and it can buy at most m tickets per day.
3.  The program then calculates the cost of buying the selected tickets. If the total number of tickets that can be bought in the selected days is equal to k, the program calculates the cost as the sum of the prices of the selected tickets multiplied by m, plus the sum of the prices of the selected tickets multiplied by m squared and the sum of the first n-1 positive integers. This is because the price of each ticket increases by m after each day.
4.  If the total number of tickets that can be bought in the selected days is not equal to k, the program calculates the cost as the price of the last selected ticket multiplied by the remaining number of tickets to be bought, plus the sum of the prices of the other selected tickets multiplied by m, plus the sum of the prices of the other selected tickets multiplied by m squared and the sum of the first n-2 positive integers, plus the price of the last selected ticket multiplied by the number of days and the remaining number of tickets to be bought.
5.  The program correctly prints the calculated cost for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
