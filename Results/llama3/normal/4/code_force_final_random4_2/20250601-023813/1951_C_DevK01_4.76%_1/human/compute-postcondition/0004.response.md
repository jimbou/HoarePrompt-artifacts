Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is the length of the list `N`, `m` is the minimum of the original value of `m` and `k`, `k` is the original value of `k`, `L` is a list of three integers, `M` is a sorted list of integers, `N` is a list of `q` integers from the sorted list `M`, `q` is the ceiling of `k` divided by the minimum of the original value of `m` and `k`, `cost` is `m` times the sum of the integers in `N` plus `m` squared times the sum of the integers from 1 to `n-1`, and the current value of `n` times `m` equals `k`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still at least 1. The length of the list `N` is still `n`. The value of `m` is still the minimum of the original value of `m` and `k`. The value of `k` is still the original value of `k`. The list `L` still contains three integers. The list `M` is still a sorted list of integers. The list `N` still contains `q` integers from the sorted list `M`. The value of `q` is still the ceiling of `k` divided by the minimum of the original value of `m` and `k`. A new variable `cost` has been introduced, which is calculated as `m` times the sum of the integers in `N` plus `m` squared times the sum of the integers from 1 to `n-1`. The product of `n` and `m` is still equal to `k`.
