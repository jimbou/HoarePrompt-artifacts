The code accepts an input and converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains multiple test cases, and the first line contains the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500). After accepting the first input, stdin now contains the test cases, and the first line of each test case contains three integers `p_1`, `p_2` and `p_3` (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30) — the scores of the three players, sorted non-decreasingly.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases, and the first line of each test case contains three integers `p_1`, `p_2` and `p_3` (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30) — the scores of the three players, sorted non-decreasingly.**
