Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the scores of the three players `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` and stores them in the list `v`.
3.  The program checks if the sum of the scores is odd. If it is, the program prints `-1` because the sum of scores must be even (each game contributes either 2 or 0 points to the total sum).
4.  If the sum of scores is even, the program calculates the maximum possible number of draws. The calculation is based on the fact that the maximum number of draws occurs when the highest score `v[2]` is as close as possible to the sum of the other two scores `v[0] + v[1]`. The expression `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` calculates the excess points that cannot be accounted for by draws. The remaining points are then divided by 2 to get the maximum possible number of draws.
5.  The program prints the calculated result for each test case.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible number of draws based on the given scores and handles invalid cases where the sum of scores is odd.

Correctness: **True**
