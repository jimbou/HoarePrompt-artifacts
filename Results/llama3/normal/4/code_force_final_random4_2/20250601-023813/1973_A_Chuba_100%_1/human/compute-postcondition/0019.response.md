The only variable in the loop head is variable `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be decreased by 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 499 inclusive, `v` is a list of three integers `p_1`, `p_2` and `p_3` (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30), stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If the sum of `p_1`, `p_2` and `p_3` is an odd number, -1 is printed. Otherwise, the value of `result` is being printed, which is either -1 or the value of (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2.**
