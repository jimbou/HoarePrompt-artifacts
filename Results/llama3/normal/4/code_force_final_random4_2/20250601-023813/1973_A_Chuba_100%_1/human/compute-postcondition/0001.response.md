To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t` and the loop variable `_`. Since the loop will execute `t` times, we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1. Additionally, the loop variable `_` is not used in the loop body, but we can still adjust its state to reflect that it will take on values from 0 to `t-1` during the loop execution.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases, and the first line of each test case contains three integers `p_1`, `p_2` and `p_3` (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30) — the scores of the three players, sorted non-decreasingly, `_` is 0**
