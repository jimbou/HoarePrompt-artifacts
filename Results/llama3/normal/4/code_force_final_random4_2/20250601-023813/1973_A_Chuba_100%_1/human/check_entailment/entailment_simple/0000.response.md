Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly handles the case where the sum of the scores is odd. In this case, it prints -1, because the sum of scores must be even (each game contributes 2 points to the total sum, either as 2 points to the winner or 1 point to each player in case of a draw). This is correctly implemented with the condition `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1`.
2.  For the case where the sum of scores is even, the program calculates the maximum possible number of draws. It does this by subtracting the maximum possible number of wins (which is `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])`) from the total sum of scores and then dividing by 2. This is because each draw contributes 2 points to the total sum, and we want to maximize the number of draws. This is correctly implemented with the expression `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2`.

Overall, the program correctly handles all possible cases and produces the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
