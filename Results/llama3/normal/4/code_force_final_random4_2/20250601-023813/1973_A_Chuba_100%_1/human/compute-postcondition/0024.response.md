The code prints the average of the three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` in the list `v`.
Since the exact values of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `result`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated average.
Output: **the average of p_1, p_2, and p_3 (where p_1, p_2, and p_3 are the three integers in the list v)**
