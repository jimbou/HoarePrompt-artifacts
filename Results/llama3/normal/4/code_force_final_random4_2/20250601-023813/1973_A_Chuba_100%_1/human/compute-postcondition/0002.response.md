Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `v` is a list of three integers `p_1`, `p_2` and `p_3` (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30), stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The variable `v` is assigned a list of three integers `p_1`, `p_2` and `p_3` which are the scores of the three players, sorted non-decreasingly, and are between 0 and 30 inclusive. The stdin contains multiple test cases, but one test case has been consumed by the `input()` function, so the number of test cases remaining is one less than the initial number.
