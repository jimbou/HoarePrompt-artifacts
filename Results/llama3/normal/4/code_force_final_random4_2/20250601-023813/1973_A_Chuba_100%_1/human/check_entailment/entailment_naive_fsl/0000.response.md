Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python program correctly calculates the maximum number of draws that could have happened in a series of chess games between three friends. The program first checks if the total sum of scores is even, which is a necessary condition for the scores to be valid (since each game results in either 2 points for a win, 0 points for a loss, or 1 point for a draw). If the sum is odd, the program prints -1, indicating that the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games.

If the sum is even, the program calculates the maximum number of draws by subtracting the maximum possible number of wins (which is the difference between the highest score and the sum of the two lower scores) from the total sum, and then dividing the result by 2. This is because each draw contributes 1 point to the total sum, and the program wants to maximize the number of draws.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the case where no games were played (in which case the maximum number of draws is 0), and the case where the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games (in which case the program prints -1).

The program also correctly handles the examples provided, producing the expected output for each case. Therefore, the program is correct, and the answer is **True**.
