Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum number of draws that could have happened in a series of chess games between three friends. The program takes as input the scores of the three players, sorted in non-decreasing order.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the scores of the three players `v[0]`, `v[1]`, and `v[2]`.
3. It then checks if the sum of the scores is odd. If it is, the program prints `-1` because the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games and results. This is because each game can only result in an even number of points (either 2 points for a win, 0 points for a loss, or 1 point for a draw).
4. If the sum of the scores is even, the program calculates the maximum number of draws that could have happened. It does this by subtracting the maximum possible number of wins (i.e., `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])`) from the total number of points and then dividing the result by 2. This is because each draw contributes 1 point to the total score, and we want to maximize the number of draws.
5. Finally, the program prints the calculated result.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. Therefore,

Correctness: **True**
