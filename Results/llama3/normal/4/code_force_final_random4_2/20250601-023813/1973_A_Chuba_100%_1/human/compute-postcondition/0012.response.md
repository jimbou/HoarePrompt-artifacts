Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `v` is a list of three integers `p_1`, `p_2` and `p_3` (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30), stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, if the sum of `p_1`, `p_2` and `p_3` is an odd number, -1 is printed. Otherwise, the value of `result` is being printed.**

In this output state, the value of `v` has been updated to a list of three integers `p_1`, `p_2` and `p_3` (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30) from the input. The value of `t` remains the same, an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive. The stdin now contains multiple test cases - 1, as one test case has been read. Additionally, if the sum of `p_1`, `p_2` and `p_3` is an odd number, -1 is printed, otherwise, the value of `result` is being printed.
