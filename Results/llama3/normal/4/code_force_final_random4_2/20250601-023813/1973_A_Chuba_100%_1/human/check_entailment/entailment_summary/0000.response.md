Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly handles the case where the sum of the scores is odd. In this case, it prints -1, which is the correct output according to the problem description.
2.  When the sum of the scores is even, the program calculates the maximum possible number of draws. The formula used to calculate this is correct. It subtracts the maximum possible number of wins (which is `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])`) from the total sum of scores and then divides the result by 2. This gives the maximum possible number of draws.
3.  The program processes all test cases correctly and does not return any value, as required.

Correctness: **True**
