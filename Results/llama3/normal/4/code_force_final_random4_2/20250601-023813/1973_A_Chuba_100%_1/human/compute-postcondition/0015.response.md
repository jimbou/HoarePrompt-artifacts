Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `v` is a list of three integers `p_1`, `p_2` and `p_3` (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30), `result` is either -1 or the value of (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows: The value of `t` remains unchanged, still an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive. The list `v` also remains unchanged, containing three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` in non-decreasing order, each between 0 and 30 inclusive. The variable `result` is assigned a value based on the sum of the elements in `v`. If the sum is odd, `result` is -1. Otherwise, `result` is calculated using the formula `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2`. The stdin contains one less test case than before.
