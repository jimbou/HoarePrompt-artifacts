Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to 0, `v` is a list of three integers `p_1`, `p_2` and `p_3` (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30), stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If the sum of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` is odd, -1 is printed. Otherwise, the average of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The list `v` will still contain the last set of scores for the three players, and the standard input will still contain the remaining test cases. The loop will have printed either -1 or the average of the scores for each test case, depending on whether the sum of the scores was odd or even.
