Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 499 inclusive, `v` is a list of three integers `p_1`, `p_2` and `p_3` (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30), stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If the sum of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` is odd, -1 is being printed. Otherwise, the average of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` is being printed.***
