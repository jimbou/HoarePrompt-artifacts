Output: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `v` is a list of three integers `p_1`, `p_2` and `p_3` (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30), `result` is either -1 or the value of (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, and the value of result is being printed**
