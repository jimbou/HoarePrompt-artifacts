Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 499 inclusive, `v` is a list of three integers `p_1`, `p_2` and `p_3` (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30), stdin contains multiple test cases - 1.**

In this output state, the value of `v` has been updated to a list of three integers `p_1`, `p_2` and `p_3` (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30) which are obtained from the input. The value of `t` remains unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin has been reduced by 1.
