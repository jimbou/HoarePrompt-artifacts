Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n, a, and b are integers, k is an integer equal to the minimum of b - a + 1 and n, ans is an integer equal to the sum of the integers from b - k + 1 to b, p2 is an integer equal to the product of n - k and a.**

In this final state, the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are also unchanged, as they are only used in calculations and not reassigned. The new variables `k`, `ans`, and `p2` are introduced and assigned values based on the calculations performed in the code.
