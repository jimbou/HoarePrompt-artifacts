The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the stdin and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case contains three integers, the first integer is assigned to `t`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^9), stdin contains multiple test cases with two integers remaining for each test case.**
