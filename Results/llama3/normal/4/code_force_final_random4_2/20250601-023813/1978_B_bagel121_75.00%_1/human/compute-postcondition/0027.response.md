Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `_` is equal to `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers assigned from the input, stdin is empty. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the product of `n` and `a` is printed. Otherwise, `k` is an integer equal to the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is an integer equal to the sum of the integers from `b - k + 1` to `b`, `p2` is an integer equal to the product of `n - k` and `a`, and the sum of `ans` and `p2` is printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `t` will be greater than or equal to 0, and the loop variable `_` will be equal to `t`. The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` will hold the values assigned from the input. The stdin will be empty, indicating that all the test cases have been processed. The output will be the result of the calculations performed inside the loop, which depends on the values of `a` and `b`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the output will be the product of `n` and `a`. Otherwise, the output will be the sum of the sum of the integers from `b - k + 1` to `b` (where `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`) and the product of `n - k` and `a`.
