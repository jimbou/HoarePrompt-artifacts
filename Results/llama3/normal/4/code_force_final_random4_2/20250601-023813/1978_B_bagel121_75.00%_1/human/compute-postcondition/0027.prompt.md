Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^9), stdin contains multiple test cases with two integers remaining for each test case.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if a >= b:
        print(n * a)
    else:
        k = min(b - a + 1, n)
        ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)
        p2 = (n - k) * a
        print(ans + p2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the product of `n` and `a` is being printed. Otherwise, `a` is less than `b`, and the sum of the sum of the integers from `b - k + 1` to `b` (where `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`) and the product of `n - k` and `a` is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers assigned from the input, stdin is empty. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the product of `n` and `a` is printed. Otherwise, `k` is an integer equal to the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is an integer equal to the sum of the integers from `b - k + 1` to `b`, `p2` is an integer equal to the product of `n - k` and `a`, and the sum of `ans` and `p2` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers assigned from the input, stdin is empty. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the product of `n` and `a` is printed. Otherwise, `k` is an integer equal to the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is an integer equal to the sum of the integers from `b - k + 1` to `b`, `p2` is an integer equal to the product of `n - k` and `a`, and the sum of `ans` and `p2` is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
