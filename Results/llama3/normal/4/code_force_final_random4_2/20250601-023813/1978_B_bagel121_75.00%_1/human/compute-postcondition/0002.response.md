Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^9) and is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged. The code assigns the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input, which is a space-separated list of integers. Since the input is consumed, the stdin is now empty. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers, but their specific values depend on the input provided.
