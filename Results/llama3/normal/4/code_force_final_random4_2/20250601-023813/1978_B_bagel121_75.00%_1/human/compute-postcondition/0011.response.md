The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the product of `n` and `a` is being printed. Otherwise, `a` is less than `b`, and the sum of the sum of the integers from `b - k + 1` to `b` (where `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`) and the product of `n - k` and `a` is being printed.**
