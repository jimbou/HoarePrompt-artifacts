Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the product of `n` and `a` is being printed. Otherwise, `a` is less than `b`, and the sum of the sum of the integers from `b - k + 1` to `b` (where `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`) and the product of `n - k` and `a` is being printed.***
