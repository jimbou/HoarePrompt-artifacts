Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers assigned from the input, stdin is empty. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the product of `n` and `a` is printed. Otherwise, `k` is an integer equal to the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is an integer equal to the sum of the integers from `b - k + 1` to `b`, `p2` is an integer equal to the product of `n - k` and `a`, and the sum of `ans` and `p2` is printed.***
