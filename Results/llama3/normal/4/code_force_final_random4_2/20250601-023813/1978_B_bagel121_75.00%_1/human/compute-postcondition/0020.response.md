Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers assigned from the input, stdin is empty. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the product of `n` and `a` is printed. Otherwise, `k` is an integer equal to the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is an integer equal to the sum of the integers from `b - k + 1` to `b`, `p2` is an integer equal to the product of `n - k` and `a`, and the sum of `ans` and `p2` is printed.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged. The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` are assigned new integer values from the input, which is now empty. The conditions for printing the product of `n` and `a` or the sum of `ans` and `p2` are still valid, depending on the values of `a` and `b`.
