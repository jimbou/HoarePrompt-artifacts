Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers assigned from the input, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are now specific integers obtained from the input, replacing their previous general integer values. The stdin is now empty since it has been used to read the input. The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged.
