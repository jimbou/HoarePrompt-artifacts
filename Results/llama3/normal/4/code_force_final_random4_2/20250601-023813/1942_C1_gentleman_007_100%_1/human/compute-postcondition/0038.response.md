Postcondition: ***`ver` is the new node that was previously at the front of the queue `q`, `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are lists of neighboring nodes, `vis` is a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are boolean flags indicating whether the node has been visited, `ver` has been marked as visited, the node `ver` has been printed, `graph[ver]` has at least one neighboring node, `node` is one of the neighboring nodes in `graph[ver]`, and `q` has at least one node. If `node` has not been visited, then `node` has been marked as visited and appended to the queue `q`, and the node `ver` is printed again followed by a space, and `q` has at least two nodes. Otherwise, no changes have been made.***
