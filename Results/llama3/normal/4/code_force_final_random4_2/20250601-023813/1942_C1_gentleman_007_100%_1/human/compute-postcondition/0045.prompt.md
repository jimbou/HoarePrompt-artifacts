Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ver` is the new node that was previously at the front of the queue `q`, `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are lists of neighboring nodes, `vis` is a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are boolean flags indicating whether the node has been visited, `ver` has been marked as visited, the node `ver` has been printed, `graph[ver]` is empty, `node` is the last neighboring node in `graph[ver]`, `q` has at least one node, and this is printed: the node that was previously at the front of the queue `q` which is `ver`. If `node` has not been visited, then `node` has been marked as visited and appended to the queue `q`, and the node `ver` is printed again followed by a space.
Code of the loop:
for node in graph[ver]:
    if not vis[node]:
        q.append(node)
        vis[node] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`ver` is the new node that was previously at the front of the queue `q`, `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are lists of neighboring nodes, `vis` is a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are boolean flags indicating whether the node has been visited, `ver` has been marked as visited, the node `ver` has been printed, `graph[ver]` has at least one neighboring node, `node` is one of the neighboring nodes in `graph[ver]`, and `q` has at least one node. If `node` has not been visited, then `node` has been marked as visited and appended to the queue `q`, and the node `ver` is printed again followed by a space, and `q` has at least two nodes. Otherwise, no changes have been made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`ver` is the new node that was previously at the front of the queue `q`, `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are lists of neighboring nodes, `vis` is a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are boolean flags indicating whether the node has been visited, `ver` has been marked as visited, the node `ver` has been printed twice followed by a space if `node` has not been visited, otherwise the node `ver` has been printed once, `graph[ver]` has at least two neighboring nodes, `node` is the second neighboring node in `graph[ver]`, and `q` has at least two nodes if `node` has not been visited, otherwise `q` has at least one node.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`ver` is the new node that was previously at the front of the queue `q`, `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are lists of neighboring nodes, `vis` is a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are boolean flags indicating whether the node has been visited, `ver` has been marked as visited, the node `ver` has been printed twice followed by a space if `node` has not been visited, otherwise the node `ver` has been printed once, `graph[ver]` has at least three neighboring nodes, `node` is the third neighboring node in `graph[ver]`. If `node` has not been visited, `q` has at least three nodes and `node` has been marked as visited. Otherwise, `q` has at least two nodes.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
