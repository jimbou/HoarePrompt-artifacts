The value of `j` is decremented by 1. The value of `j` was greater than 0 and less than or equal to `len(b)`, so the new value of `j` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to `len(b)`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`a` is a list of values with at least 1 element, `b` is a list of values of any type and value that must have at least `len(b)` elements, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)`, `i` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `len(a)`, `j` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to `len(b)`.**
