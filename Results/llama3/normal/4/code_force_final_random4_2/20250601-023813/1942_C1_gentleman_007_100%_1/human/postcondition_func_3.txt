The function generates a 2D list with a specified number of rows and columns, where every element is initialized with a given value. It takes three parameters: the number of rows (n), the number of columns (m), and the initial value (v), and returns a 2D list with 'n' rows and 'm' columns, where each element is the value 'v'.
