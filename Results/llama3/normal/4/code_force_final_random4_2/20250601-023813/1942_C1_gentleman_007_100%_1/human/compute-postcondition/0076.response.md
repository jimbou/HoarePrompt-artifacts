Output State: **`a` is a list of values with at least 1 element, `b` is a list of values of any type and value that must have at least `len(b)` elements, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)`, `i` is equal to 0, `j` is equal to 0, `l` is a list containing the common elements of `a` and `b` in the order they appear in `a`, and `s` is a string containing the common elements of `a` and `b` in the order they appear in `a`, concatenated into a single string.**

In this output state, the value of `s` is a string that contains the common elements of `a` and `b` in the order they appear in `a`, concatenated into a single string. The other variables remain unchanged.
