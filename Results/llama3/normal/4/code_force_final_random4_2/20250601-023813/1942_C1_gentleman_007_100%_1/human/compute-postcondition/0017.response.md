Output State: **`ver` is the node that was previously at the front of the queue `q`, `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are lists of neighboring nodes, `vis` is a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are boolean flags indicating whether the node has been visited, `ver` has been marked as visited, the node `ver` has been printed, `graph[ver]` must have at least as many neighboring nodes as the number of iterations of the loop, `node` is the last neighboring node in `graph[ver]`, `q` is not empty but has one less node than before.**

In this output state, the value of `ver` has been updated to the node that was previously at the front of the queue `q`, which was removed from the queue by the `popleft()` operation. The other variables remain unchanged, but the queue `q` now has one less node than before.
