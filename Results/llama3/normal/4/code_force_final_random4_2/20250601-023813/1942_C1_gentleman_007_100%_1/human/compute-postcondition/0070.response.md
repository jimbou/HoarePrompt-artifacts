Output State: **`a` is a list of values with at least 1 element, `b` is a list of values of any type and value that must have at least `len(b)` elements, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)`, `i` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `len(a)`, `j` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `len(b)`. If `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, then `i` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `len(a)`, and `j` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to `len(b)`. Otherwise, `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `len(a)`, `j` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `len(b)`, and a new list `l` is created with an additional element which is the ith element of `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `j` has been decremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to `dp[i][j]`, `i`, and `j` are still valid, and the new list `l` is still created with an additional element which is the ith element of `a` if `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`.
