Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ver` is a node in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are lists of neighboring nodes, `vis` is a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are boolean flags indicating whether the node has been visited, `q` is a queue containing one less node, and `ver` has been marked as visited, and the node `ver` is printed
Code of the loop:
for node in graph[ver]:
    if not vis[node]:
        q.append(node)
        vis[node] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`ver` is a node in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are lists of neighboring nodes, `vis` is a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are boolean flags indicating whether the node has been visited, `q` is a queue containing one more node if the first neighboring node `node` in `graph[ver]` has not been visited before, otherwise the queue remains the same, `ver` has been marked as visited, the node `ver` is printed, `graph[ver]` must have at least one neighboring node, `node` is the first neighboring node in `graph[ver]`, and the current value of `vis[node]` is True, indicating that `node` has been visited.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`ver` is a node in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are lists of neighboring nodes, `vis` is a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are boolean flags indicating whether the node has been visited, `ver` has been marked as visited, the node `ver` has been printed, `graph[ver]` must have at least two neighboring nodes, `node` is the second neighboring node in `graph[ver]`. If `node` has not been visited before, `q` is a queue containing `node`. Otherwise, `q` remains the same.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`ver` is a node in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are lists of neighboring nodes, `vis` is a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are boolean flags indicating whether the node has been visited, `ver` has been marked as visited, the node `ver` has been printed, `graph[ver]` must have at least three neighboring nodes, `node` is the third neighboring node in `graph[ver]`. If `node` has not been visited before, `q` is a queue containing `node` and `vis[node]` is 1. If `node` has been visited before, `q` remains the same and `vis[node]` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
