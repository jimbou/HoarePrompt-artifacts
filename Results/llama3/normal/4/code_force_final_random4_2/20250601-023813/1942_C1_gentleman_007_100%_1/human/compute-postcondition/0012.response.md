The only objects in the loop head are variables  node and graph[ver], so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the neighboring nodes of the node `ver`.  If the list of neighboring nodes has at least 3 nodes the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `graph[ver]` has at least 2 neighboring nodes, `node` is the second neighboring node in `graph[ver]`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 neighboring nodes and the node is the third neighboring node in `graph[ver]`.
State: **`ver` is a node in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are lists of neighboring nodes, `vis` is a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are boolean flags indicating whether the node has been visited, `ver` has been marked as visited, the node `ver` has been printed, `graph[ver]` must have at least three neighboring nodes, `node` is the third neighboring node in `graph[ver]`. If `node` has not been visited before, `q` is a queue containing `node`. Otherwise, `q` remains the same.**
