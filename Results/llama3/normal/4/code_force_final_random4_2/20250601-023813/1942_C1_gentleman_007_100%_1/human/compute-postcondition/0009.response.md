The only objects in the loop head are variables  node and graph[ver], so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the neighboring nodes of `ver` in `graph`.  If the list of neighboring nodes has at least 2 nodes the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `graph[ver]` has at least one neighboring node, `node` is the first neighboring node in `graph[ver]`, and the current value of `vis[node]` is True, indicating that `node` has been visited. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list of neighboring nodes must have at least 2 nodes and the node is the second neighboring node in `graph[ver]`.
State: **`ver` is a node in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are lists of neighboring nodes, `vis` is a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are boolean flags indicating whether the node has been visited, `q` is a queue containing one more node if the first neighboring node `node` in `graph[ver]` has not been visited before, otherwise the queue remains the same, `ver` has been marked as visited, the node `ver` is printed, `graph[ver]` must have at least two neighboring nodes, `node` is the second neighboring node in `graph[ver]`, and the current value of `vis[node]` is True, indicating that `node` has been visited.**
