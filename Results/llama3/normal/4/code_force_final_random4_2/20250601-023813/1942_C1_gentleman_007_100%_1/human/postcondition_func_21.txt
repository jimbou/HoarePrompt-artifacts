This function takes two lists 'a' and 'b' as input, compares their elements, and returns a string containing the common elements of 'a' and 'b' in the reverse order they appear in 'a'. The function performs a dynamic programming approach to find the longest common subsequence between 'a' and 'b', and then constructs the resulting string by tracing back the common elements from the end of the lists. The function returns an empty string if there are no common elements between 'a' and 'b'.
