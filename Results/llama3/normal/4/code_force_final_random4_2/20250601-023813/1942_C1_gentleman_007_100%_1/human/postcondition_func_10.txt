This function generates a list of all prime numbers from 2 to a given positive integer `num`. It initializes three lists: `prime` to track whether each number is prime, `Highest_Prime` to store the highest prime factor of each number, and `Lowest_Prime` to store the lowest prime factor of each number. The function then iterates through numbers from 2 to `num`, marking non-prime numbers and updating their highest and lowest prime factors. Finally, it constructs a list `p` containing all prime numbers from 2 to `num` and returns this list. The function does not modify the input `num` and returns a list of prime numbers within the specified range.
