Postcondition: ***`ver` is the new node that was previously at the front of the queue `q`, `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are lists of neighboring nodes, `vis` is a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are boolean flags indicating whether the node has been visited, `ver` has been marked as visited, the node `ver` has been printed twice followed by a space if `node` has not been visited, otherwise the node `ver` has been printed once, `graph[ver]` has at least three neighboring nodes, `node` is the third neighboring node in `graph[ver]`. If `node` has not been visited, `q` has at least three nodes and `node` has been marked as visited. Otherwise, `q` has at least two nodes.***
