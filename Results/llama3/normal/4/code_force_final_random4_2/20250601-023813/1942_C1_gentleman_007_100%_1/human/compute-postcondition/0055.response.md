Output State: **`a` is a list of values with at least 1 element, `b` is a list of values of any type and value that must have at least `len(b)` elements, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)`, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `j` is equal to `len(b) - 1`, `l` is an empty list. The current value of `dp[i][j]` is equal to the current value of `dp[i][j + 1]`**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `a` and `b` remain unchanged. The 2D list `dp` also remains unchanged. The value of `i` is still equal to the length of list `a`. The value of `j` is decremented by 1, so it is now equal to `len(b) - 1`. The list `l` is still empty. The current value of `dp[i][j]` is equal to the current value of `dp[i][j + 1]`, which means the value of `dp[i][j]` is still the same as before, but now `j` is pointing to the previous element.
