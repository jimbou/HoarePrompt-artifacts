The code prints the node that was previously at the front of the queue `q`, which is `ver`. Since `ver` has been marked as visited and printed, it indicates that the node has been processed in the current iteration of the loop. The `end=' '` argument in the print statement means that a space will be printed after the node, but no newline character.

Output: **ver (the node that was previously at the front of the queue q)**
