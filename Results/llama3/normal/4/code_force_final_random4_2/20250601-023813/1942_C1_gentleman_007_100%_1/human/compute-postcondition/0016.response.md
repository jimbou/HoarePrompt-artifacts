To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of `q` so that its length is greater than 0.

State: **`ver` is a node in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are lists of neighboring nodes, `vis` is a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are boolean flags indicating whether the node has been visited, `ver` has been marked as visited, the node `ver` has been printed, `graph[ver]` must have at least as many neighboring nodes as the number of iterations of the loop, `node` is the last neighboring node in `graph[ver]`, `q` is not empty**
