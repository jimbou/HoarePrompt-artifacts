Output State: **`a` is a list of values with at least 1 element, `b` is a list of values of any type and value that must have at least `len(b)` elements, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)`, `i` is equal to `len(a) - 1`, `j` is equal to `len(b) - 1`, `l` is a list containing the last element of `a`. The value of `dp[i][j]` is not equal to the value of `dp[i][j - 1]` and the value of `dp[i][j]` is not equal to the value of `dp[i - 1][j]`.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been decremented by 1, and the value of `j` has also been decremented by 1. The list `l` now contains the last element of `a`, which was appended to it. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
