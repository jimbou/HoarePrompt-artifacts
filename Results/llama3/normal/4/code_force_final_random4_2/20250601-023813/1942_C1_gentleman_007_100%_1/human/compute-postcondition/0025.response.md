Output State: **ver is the node that was previously at the front of the queue q, graph is a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are lists of neighboring nodes, vis is a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are boolean flags indicating whether the node has been visited, ver has been marked as visited, the node ver has been printed, graph[ver] must have at least as many neighboring nodes as the number of iterations of the loop minus one, node is the second neighboring node in graph[ver], q is not empty but has one less node than before, node has been marked as visited, and node has been appended to the queue q.**

In this final state, the code has added the second neighboring node (`node`) to the queue `q` and marked it as visited by setting `vis[node]` to 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged, with `ver` still being the previously visited node, `graph` remaining the same, and `q` having one less node than before but now including `node`.
