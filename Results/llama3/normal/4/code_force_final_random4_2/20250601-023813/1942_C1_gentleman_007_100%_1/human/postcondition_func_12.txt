This function takes a positive integer as input and returns a dictionary containing its prime factors as keys and their respective powers as values. The function reduces the input integer to 1 by iteratively dividing it by prime numbers and storing the prime factors and their powers in the dictionary. If the remaining integer is greater than 1, it is also added to the dictionary as a prime factor. The function returns the dictionary containing all prime factors and their powers.
