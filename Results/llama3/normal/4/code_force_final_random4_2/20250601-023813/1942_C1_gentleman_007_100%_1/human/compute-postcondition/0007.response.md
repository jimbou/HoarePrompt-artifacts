Output State: **ver is a node in the graph, graph is a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are lists of neighboring nodes, vis is a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are boolean flags indicating whether the node has been visited, q is a queue containing one more node, ver has been marked as visited, the node ver is printed, graph[ver] must have at least one neighboring node, node is the first neighboring node in graph[ver], and the current value of vis[node] is True, indicating that node has been visited.**

The code adds the neighboring node to the queue and marks it as visited. The queue now contains one more node, and the visited status of the neighboring node is updated to True. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
