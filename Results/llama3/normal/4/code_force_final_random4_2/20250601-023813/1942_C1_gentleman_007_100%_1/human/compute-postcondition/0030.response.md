Output State: **`ver` is the node that was previously at the front of the queue `q`, `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are lists of neighboring nodes, `vis` is a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are boolean flags indicating whether the node has been visited, `ver` has been marked as visited, the node `ver` has been printed, `graph[ver]` is empty, `node` is the last neighboring node in `graph[ver]`, `q` is not empty but has one less node than before, and this is printed: the node that was previously at the front of the queue `q` which is `ver`. If `node` has not been visited, then `node` has been marked as visited and appended to the queue `q`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has processed all the neighboring nodes of the current node `ver`. The node `ver` has been marked as visited and printed, and its neighboring nodes have been added to the queue `q` if they have not been visited before. The queue `q` now contains all the neighboring nodes of `ver` that have not been visited before, and the loop has finished executing.
