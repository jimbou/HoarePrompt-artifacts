The code `ver = q.popleft()` removes the leftmost element from the queue `q` and assigns it to the variable `ver`. Since `ver` has been marked as visited and is a node in the graph, the value of `ver` remains the same. The queue `q` now contains one less element. The values of the other variables, `graph` and `vis`, are not affected.

Output State: **`ver` is a node in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are lists of neighboring nodes, `vis` is a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are boolean flags indicating whether the node has been visited, `q` is a queue containing one less node, and `ver` has been marked as visited.**
