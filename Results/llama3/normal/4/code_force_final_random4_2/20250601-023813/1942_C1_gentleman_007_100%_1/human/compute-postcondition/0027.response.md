The only objects in the loop head are variables  node and graph[ver], so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the neighboring nodes of the node `ver`. If the neighboring nodes of the node `ver` have at least as many nodes as the number of iterations of the loop, the loop executes again for the next iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `graph[ver]` has at least as many neighboring nodes as the number of iterations of the loop minus one, `node` is the second neighboring node in `graph[ver]`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the `graph[ver]` must have at least as many neighboring nodes as the number of iterations of the loop, and the `node` is the third neighboring node in `graph[ver]`.
State: **`ver` is the node that was previously at the front of the queue `q`, `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are lists of neighboring nodes, `vis` is a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are boolean flags indicating whether the node has been visited, `ver` has been marked as visited, the node `ver` has been printed, `graph[ver]` must have at least as many neighboring nodes as the number of iterations of the loop, `node` is the third neighboring node in `graph[ver]`, `q` is not empty but has one less node than before, and this is printed: the node that was previously at the front of the queue `q` which is `ver`. If `node` has not been visited, then `node` has been marked as visited and appended to the queue `q`.**
