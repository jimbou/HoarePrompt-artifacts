Output State: **`a` is a list of values with at least len(b) + 1 elements, `b` is a list of values of any type and value that must have at least len(b) elements, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1), `i` is len(b) + 2, `j` is len(b). If `a[i - 1]` is equal to `b[j - 1]`, then `dp[i][j]` is `dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1`. Otherwise, `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i - 1][j]` and `dp[i][j - 1]`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the 2D list `dp` will have its last row (`i` is `len(b) + 2`) filled with values based on the comparison between the elements of `a` and `b`. If an element in `a` matches an element in `b`, the corresponding value in `dp` will be the value from the previous diagonal cell plus one. If there's no match, the value in `dp` will be the maximum of the values from the cell above and the cell to the left. The loop will iterate through all elements of `b`, and the final state of `dp` will reflect the longest common subsequence between `a` and `b`.
