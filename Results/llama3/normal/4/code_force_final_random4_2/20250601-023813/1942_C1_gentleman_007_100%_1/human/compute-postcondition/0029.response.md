Postcondition: ***`ver` is the node that was previously at the front of the queue `q`, `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are lists of neighboring nodes, `vis` is a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are boolean flags indicating whether the node has been visited, `ver` has been marked as visited, the node `ver` has been printed, `graph[ver]` must have at least as many neighboring nodes as the number of iterations of the loop, `node` is the third neighboring node in `graph[ver]`, if `node` has not been visited, then `node` has been marked as visited and appended to the queue `q`, and `q` is not empty but has one more node than before if `node` was not visited, otherwise `q` is not empty but has one less node than before.***
