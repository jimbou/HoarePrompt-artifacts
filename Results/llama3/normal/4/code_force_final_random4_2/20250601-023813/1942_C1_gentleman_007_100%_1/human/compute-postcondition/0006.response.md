Postcondition: ***`ver` is a node in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are lists of neighboring nodes, `vis` is a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are boolean flags indicating whether the node has been visited, `q` is a queue containing one less node, and `ver` has been marked as visited, and the node `ver` is printed, `graph[ver]` must have at least one neighboring node, `node` is the first neighboring node in `graph[ver]`, and the current value of `vis[node]` is False, indicating that `node` has not been visited.***
