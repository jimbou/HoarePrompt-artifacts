Output State: **`ver` is a node in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are lists of neighboring nodes, `vis` is a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are boolean flags indicating whether the node has been visited, `ver` has been marked as visited, the node `ver` has been printed, `graph[ver]` must have at least as many neighboring nodes as the number of iterations of the loop, `node` is the last neighboring node in `graph[ver]`. If `node` has not been visited before, `q` is a queue containing `node` and `vis[node]` is 1. If `node` has been visited before, `q` remains the same and `vis[node]` remains unchanged.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the node `ver` has been visited and printed, and its neighboring nodes have been processed. The queue `q` contains all the neighboring nodes of `ver` that have not been visited before, and the `vis` dictionary has been updated to reflect the visitation status of these nodes. The graph and the initial state of the other variables remain unchanged.
