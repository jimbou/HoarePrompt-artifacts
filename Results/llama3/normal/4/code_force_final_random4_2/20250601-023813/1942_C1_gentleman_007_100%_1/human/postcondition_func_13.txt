This function calculates and returns a value based on the input dictionary `d`. The dictionary `d` is expected to have integer keys greater than 1 and integer values greater than 0. The function iterates through each key in the dictionary, calculates the power of the key to the value minus 1, multiplies it by the key minus 1, and sums up these values. The final result is returned. The function does not modify the input dictionary `d`.
