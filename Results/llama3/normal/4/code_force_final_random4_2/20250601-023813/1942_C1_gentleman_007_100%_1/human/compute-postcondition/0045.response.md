Output State: **`ver` is the new node that was previously at the front of the queue `q`, `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are lists of neighboring nodes, `vis` is a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are boolean flags indicating whether the node has been visited, `ver` has been marked as visited, the node `ver` has been printed as many times as there are neighboring nodes in `graph[ver]` followed by a space if all neighboring nodes have not been visited, otherwise the node `ver` has been printed once, `graph[ver]` has been fully traversed, `node` is the last neighboring node in `graph[ver]`, and `q` has at least as many nodes as there are neighboring nodes in `graph[ver]` if all neighboring nodes have not been visited, otherwise `q` has at least one node.**

In natural language, this output state means that the loop has iterated over all neighboring nodes of the current node `ver` in the graph. If any of these neighboring nodes had not been visited before, they have now been marked as visited and added to the queue `q`. The node `ver` has been printed as many times as there are neighboring nodes, followed by a space if all neighboring nodes were not visited before. The graph `graph[ver]` has been fully traversed, and the queue `q` now contains at least as many nodes as there are neighboring nodes in `graph[ver]`, unless all neighboring nodes were already visited, in which case `q` still has at least one node.
