Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when the number of vertices Bessie has chosen (x) is equal to the number of sides of the polygon (n). In this case, the program should return 0, because no more vertices can be chosen to form non-intersecting diagonals. However, the program does not check for this case and will return an incorrect result.

For example, if the input is:

3
8 8 0
1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8

The program will return 6, but the correct answer is 0, because all vertices are already chosen and no more diagonals can be formed.
