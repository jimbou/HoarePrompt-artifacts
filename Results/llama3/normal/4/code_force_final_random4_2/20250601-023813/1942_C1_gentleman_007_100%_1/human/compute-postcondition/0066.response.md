Output State: **a is a list of values with at least 1 element, b is a list of values of any type and value that must have at least len(b) elements, dp is a 2D list with dimensions (len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1), i is greater than or equal to 0 and less than len(a), j is greater than or equal to 0 and less than len(b), l is a list with an additional element which is the ith element of a.**

In this output state, the values of `a`, `b`, and `dp` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is decremented by 1, making it greater than or equal to 0 and less than `len(a)`. Similarly, the value of `j` is decremented by 1, making it greater than or equal to 0 and less than `len(b)`. The list `l` now has an additional element, which is the `i`-th element of `a`.
