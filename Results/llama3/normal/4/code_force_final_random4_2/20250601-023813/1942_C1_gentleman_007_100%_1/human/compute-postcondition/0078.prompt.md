You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are lists of values of any type and value
    dp = [([0] * (len(b) + 1)) for _ in range(len(a) + 1)]
    for i in range(1, len(a) + 1):
        for j in range(1, len(b) + 1):
            if a[i - 1] == b[j - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])
        
    #State: Output State: `a` is a list of values with at least 1 element, `b` is a list of values of any type and value that must have at least len(b) elements, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1). The value of `dp[i][j]` is determined by whether the current value of `a[i - 1]` is equal to the current value of `b[j - 1]`. If they are equal, `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1`. Otherwise, `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i - 1][j]` and `dp[i][j - 1]`. The loop has executed len(a) times, so i is equal to len(a) and j is equal to len(b).
    #
    #In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `a` and `b` remain lists of values with at least 1 element and len(b) elements respectively, and `dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1). The value of `dp[i][j]` is determined by whether the current value of `a[i - 1]` is equal to the current value of `b[j - 1]`. If they are equal, `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1`. Otherwise, `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i - 1][j]` and `dp[i][j - 1]`. The loop has executed len(a) times, so i is equal to len(a) and j is equal to len(b).
    i, j = len(a), len(b)
    l = []
    while i != 0 and j != 0:
        if dp[i][j] == dp[i][j - 1]:
            j -= 1
        elif dp[i][j] == dp[i - 1][j]:
            i -= 1
        else:
            i -= 1
            j -= 1
            l.append(a[i])
        
    #State: `a` is a list of values with at least 1 element, `b` is a list of values of any type and value that must have at least `len(b)` elements, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)`, `i` is equal to 0, `j` is equal to 0, and `l` is a list containing the common elements of `a` and `b` in the order they appear in `a`.
    s = ''.join(l)
    return s[::-1]
    #The program returns a string containing the common elements of lists 'a' and 'b' in the reverse order they appear in 'a'.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a string containing the common elements of lists 'a' and 'b' in the reverse order they appear in 'a'.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
