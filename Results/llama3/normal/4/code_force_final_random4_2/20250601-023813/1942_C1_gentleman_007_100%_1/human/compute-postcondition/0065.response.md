Output State: **`a` is a list of values with at least 1 element, `b` is a list of values of any type and value that must have at least `len(b)` elements, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)`, `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `len(a)`, `j` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `len(b)`**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been decremented by 1, so it is now greater than or equal to 0 and less than `len(a)`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
