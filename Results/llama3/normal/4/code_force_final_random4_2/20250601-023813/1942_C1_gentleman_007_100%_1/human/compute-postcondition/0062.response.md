Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of values with at least 1 element, `b` is a list of values of any type and value that must have at least `len(b)` elements, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)`. If `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, then `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `j` is equal to `len(b) - 1`, and `l` is an empty list. The current value of `dp[i][j]` is equal to the current value of `dp[i][j + 1]`. Otherwise, `i` is equal to `len(a) - 1`, `j` is equal to `len(b)`, and if `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i - 1][j]`, then `l` is an empty list. Otherwise, `j` is equal to `len(b) - 1`, `l` is a list containing the last element of `a`, and the value of `dp[i][j]` is not equal to the value of `dp[i][j - 1]`.***
