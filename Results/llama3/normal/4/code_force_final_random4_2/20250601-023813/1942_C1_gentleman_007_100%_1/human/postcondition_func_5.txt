This function generates a 2D list representing a graph with n nodes, where m edges are added between nodes based on the output of the func_1() function. The resulting graph is represented as an adjacency matrix, where l[x][y] and l[y][x] are 1 if there is an edge between nodes x and y, and 0 otherwise. The function returns this adjacency matrix.
