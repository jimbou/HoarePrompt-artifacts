The code snippet consists of three lines that modify the state of the program. The first line creates an empty queue `q`. The second line appends the node `ver` to the queue `q`, making it the first element in the queue. The third line sets the visited flag of node `ver` to 1 in the dictionary `vis`, indicating that node `ver` has been visited.

Output State: **ver is a node in the graph, graph is a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are lists of neighboring nodes, vis is a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are boolean flags indicating whether the node has been visited, q is a queue containing the node ver, and ver has been marked as visited.**
