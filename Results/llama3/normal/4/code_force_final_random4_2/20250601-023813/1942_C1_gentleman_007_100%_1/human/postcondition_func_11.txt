This function takes a positive integer `num` and a list `Prime_array` as input, where `Prime_array[i]` is a prime factor of `i` for all `i` in the range of `num`. It returns a dictionary with one key-value pair, where the key is a prime factor of the original value of `num` and the value is the highest power of the prime factor in the prime factorization of the original value of `num`. The function effectively calculates the prime factorization of the input number `num` and returns the result as a dictionary.
