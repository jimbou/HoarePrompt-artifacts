This function calculates and returns a 2D list `p` with dimensions `(n+1) x (m+1)`, where `n` and `m` are the dimensions of the input 2D list `l` of integers. The value at each position `p[i][j]` is the sum of the values in the rectangle from the top-left corner of `l` to the cell at position `(i-1, j-1)`, for all `i` from 1 to `n` and all `j` from 1 to `m`. The input list `l` remains unchanged.
