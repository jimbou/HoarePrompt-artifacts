Postcondition: ***`ver` is a node in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are lists of neighboring nodes, `vis` is a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are boolean flags indicating whether the node has been visited, `ver` has been marked as visited, the node `ver` has been printed, `graph[ver]` must have at least two neighboring nodes, `node` is the second neighboring node in `graph[ver]`. If `node` has not been visited before, `q` is a queue containing `node`. Otherwise, `q` remains the same.***
