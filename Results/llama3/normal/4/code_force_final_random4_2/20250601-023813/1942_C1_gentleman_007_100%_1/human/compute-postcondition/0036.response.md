Postcondition: **`ver` is the new node that was previously at the front of the queue `q`, `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are lists of neighboring nodes, `vis` is a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are boolean flags indicating whether the node has been visited, `ver` has been marked as visited, the node `ver` has been printed, `graph[ver]` has at least one neighboring node, `node` is one of the neighboring nodes in `graph[ver]`, `q` has at least one node, and this is printed: the node that was previously at the front of the queue `q` which is `ver`. The current value of `vis[node]` is False, indicating that `node` has not been visited.**
