Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is a list of values with at least 1 element, b is a list of values of any type and value that must have at least len(b) elements, dp is a 2D list with dimensions (len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1). The value of dp[i][j] is determined by whether the current value of a[i - 1] is equal to the current value of b[j - 1]. If they are equal, dp[i][j] is equal to dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1. Otherwise, dp[i][j] is the maximum of dp[i - 1][j] and dp[i][j - 1]. The loop has executed len(a) times, so i is equal to len(a) and j is equal to len(b). l is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
while i != 0 and j != 0:
    if dp[i][j] == dp[i][j - 1]:
        j -= 1
    elif dp[i][j] == dp[i - 1][j]:
        i -= 1
    else:
        i -= 1
        j -= 1
        l.append(a[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is a list of values with at least 1 element, `b` is a list of values of any type and value that must have at least `len(b)` elements, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)`. If `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, then `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `j` is equal to `len(b) - 1`, and `l` is an empty list. The current value of `dp[i][j]` is equal to the current value of `dp[i][j + 1]`. Otherwise, `i` is equal to `len(a) - 1`, `j` is equal to `len(b)`, and if `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i - 1][j]`, then `l` is an empty list. Otherwise, `j` is equal to `len(b) - 1`, `l` is a list containing the last element of `a`, and the value of `dp[i][j]` is not equal to the value of `dp[i][j - 1]`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`a` is a list of values with at least 1 element, `b` is a list of values of any type and value that must have at least `len(b)` elements, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)`, `i` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `len(a)`, `j` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `len(b)`. If `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, then `i` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `len(a)`, and `j` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to `len(b)`. Otherwise, `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `len(a)`, `j` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `len(b)`, and a new list `l` is created with an additional element which is the ith element of `a`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`a` is a list of values with at least 1 element, `b` is a list of values of any type and value that must have at least `len(b)` elements, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)`, `i` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `len(a)`, `j` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `len(b)`. If `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, then `i` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `len(a)`, and `j` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to `len(b)`. Otherwise, `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `len(a)`, `j` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `len(b)`, and a new list `l` is created with an additional element which is the ith element of `a`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
