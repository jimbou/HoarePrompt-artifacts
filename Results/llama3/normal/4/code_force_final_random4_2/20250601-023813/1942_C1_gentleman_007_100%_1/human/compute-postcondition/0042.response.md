The only objects in the loop head are variables  node and graph[ver], so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the neighboring nodes of `ver`.  If the neighboring nodes of `ver` have at least 2 nodes the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `graph[ver]` has at least two neighboring nodes, `node` is the second neighboring node in `graph[ver]`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the neighboring nodes of `ver` must have at least 3 neighboring nodes and the `node` is the third neighboring node in `graph[ver]`.
State: **`ver` is the new node that was previously at the front of the queue `q`, `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are lists of neighboring nodes, `vis` is a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are boolean flags indicating whether the node has been visited, `ver` has been marked as visited, the node `ver` has been printed twice followed by a space if `node` has not been visited, otherwise the node `ver` has been printed once, `graph[ver]` has at least three neighboring nodes, `node` is the third neighboring node in `graph[ver]`, and `q` has at least two nodes if `node` has not been visited, otherwise `q` has at least one node.**
