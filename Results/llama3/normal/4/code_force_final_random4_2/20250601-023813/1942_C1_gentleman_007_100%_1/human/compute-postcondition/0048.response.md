Postcondition: **`a` is a list of values with at least len(b) + 1 elements, `b` is a list of values of any type and value that must have at least 2 elements, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1). If `a[i - 1]` is equal to `b[j - 1]`, then `dp[len(b) + 2][2]` is `dp[len(b) + 1][1] + 1`. Otherwise, `dp[len(b) + 2][2]` is the maximum of `dp[len(b) + 1][2]` and `dp[len(b) + 2][1]`, `j` is 2.**
