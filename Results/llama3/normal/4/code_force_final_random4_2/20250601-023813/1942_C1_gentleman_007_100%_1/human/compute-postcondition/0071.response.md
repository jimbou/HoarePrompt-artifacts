Output State: **`a` is a list of values with at least 1 element, `b` is a list of values of any type and value that must have at least `len(b)` elements, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)`, `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `len(a)`, `j` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `len(b)`. If `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, then `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to `len(a)`, and `j` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to `len(b)`. Otherwise, `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `len(a)`, `j` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `len(b)`, and a new list `l` is created with an additional element which is the ith element of `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` is decremented by 1, so it is now greater than or equal to 0 and less than `len(a)`. The values of the other variables remain the same. The conditions related to `dp[i][j]` and the creation of the new list `l` are still valid.
