Output State: **`a` is a list of values with at least 1 element, `b` is a list of values of any type and value that must have at least `len(b)` elements, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)`, `i` is equal to `len(a) - 1`, `j` is equal to `len(b)`, `l` is an empty list. The value of `dp[i][j]` is not equal to the value of `dp[i][j - 1]`. The current value of `dp[i][j]` is equal to the value of `dp[i - 1][j]`**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been decremented by 1, so it is now equal to `len(a) - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged. The conditions on the values of `dp[i][j]` and `dp[i][j - 1]` are still valid, as well as the condition that the current value of `dp[i][j]` is equal to the value of `dp[i - 1][j]`.
