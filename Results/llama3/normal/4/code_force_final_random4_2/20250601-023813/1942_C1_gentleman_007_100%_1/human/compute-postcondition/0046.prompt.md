Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: ver is a node in the graph, graph is a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are lists of neighboring nodes, vis is a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are boolean flags indicating whether the node has been visited, q is a queue containing the node ver, and ver has been marked as visited.
Code of the loop:
while len(q):
    ver = q.popleft()
    print(ver, end=' ')
    for node in graph[ver]:
        if not vis[node]:
            q.append(node)
            vis[node] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ver` is a node in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are lists of neighboring nodes, `vis` is a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are boolean flags indicating whether the node has been visited, `ver` has been marked as visited, the node `ver` has been printed, `graph[ver]` must have at least as many neighboring nodes as the number of iterations of the loop, `node` is the last neighboring node in `graph[ver]`. If `node` has not been visited before, `q` is a queue containing `node` and `vis[node]` is 1. If `node` has been visited before, `q` remains the same and `vis[node]` remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `ver` is the node that was previously at the front of the queue `q`, `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are lists of neighboring nodes, `vis` is a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are boolean flags indicating whether the node has been visited, `ver` has been marked as visited, the node `ver` has been printed, `graph[ver]` is empty, `node` is the last neighboring node in `graph[ver]`, `q` is not empty but has one less node than before, and this is printed: the node that was previously at the front of the queue `q` which is `ver`. If `node` has not been visited, then `node` has been marked as visited and appended to the queue `q`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `ver` is the new node that was previously at the front of the queue `q`, `graph` is a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are lists of neighboring nodes, `vis` is a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are boolean flags indicating whether the node has been visited, `ver` has been marked as visited, the node `ver` has been printed as many times as there are neighboring nodes in `graph[ver]` followed by a space if all neighboring nodes have not been visited, otherwise the node `ver` has been printed once, `graph[ver]` has been fully traversed, `node` is the last neighboring node in `graph[ver]`, and `q` has at least as many nodes as there are neighboring nodes in `graph[ver]` if all neighboring nodes have not been visited, otherwise `q` has at least one node.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
