Postcondition: ***`t` is a string, `x` is a list containing ten integers, `y` is a list containing ten integers, `i` is within the range from 2 to 10, the range is defined as 10, stdin is empty. If the value of `x` at index `i` is less than the value of `y` at index `i`, then the value of `x` at index `i` and the value of `y` at index `i` are printed. Otherwise, the ith element of the list `y` and the ith element of the list `x` are printed.***
