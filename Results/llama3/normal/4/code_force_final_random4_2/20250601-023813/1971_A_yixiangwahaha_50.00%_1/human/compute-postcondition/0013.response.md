The code prints the value of `y[i]` followed by a space and then the value of `x[i]`. Since `i` is within the range from 0 to 9, `y[i]` is the element at index `i` in the list `y`, and `x[i]` is the element at index `i` in the list `x`. Given that `x[i]` is greater than or equal to `y[i]` for the current index `i`, the output will be a pair of numbers where the second number is greater than or equal to the first number.

Output: **[y[i]] [x[i]] (where y[i] is the element at index i in the list y and x[i] is the element at index i in the list x, and x[i] is greater than or equal to y[i])**
