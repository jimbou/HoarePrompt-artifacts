The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 10, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1.
State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 100) followed by t-1 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9), t is a string, x is a list containing one integer, y is a list containing one integer, i is 1, the range is defined as 10**
