The code prints the current value of `x[i]` and the current value of `y[i]`, where `i` is an index within the range from 0 to 9. Since `x` and `y` are lists containing ten integers, and `i` is within the valid range, the print statement will output the values of the elements at index `i` in both lists.

Output: **x[i] (where x[i] is the value of the element at index i in the list x), y[i] (where y[i] is the value of the element at index i in the list y)**
