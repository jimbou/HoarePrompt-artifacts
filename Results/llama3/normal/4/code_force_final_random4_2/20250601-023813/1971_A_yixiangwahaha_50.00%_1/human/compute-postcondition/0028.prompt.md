Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a string, x is a list containing ten integers, y is a list containing ten integers, i is 9, the range is defined as 10, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for i in range(10):
    if x[i] < y[i]:
        print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
    else:
        print(y[i], ' ', x[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a string, `x` is a list containing ten integers, `y` is a list containing ten integers, `i` is within the range from 0 to 9, the range is defined as 10, stdin is empty. For the current index `i`, if `x[i]` is less than `y[i]`, the values of `x[i]` and `y[i]` are printed. Otherwise, the values of `y[i]` and `x[i]` are printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a string, `x` is a list containing ten integers, `y` is a list containing ten integers, `i` is within the range from 1 to 9, the range is defined as 10, stdin is empty. If the ith element of `x` is less than the ith element of `y`, then the ith element of `x` and the ith element of `y` are printed. Otherwise, the ith element of `y` and the ith element of `x` are printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a string, `x` is a list containing ten integers, `y` is a list containing ten integers, `i` is within the range from 2 to 10, the range is defined as 10, stdin is empty. If the value of `x` at index `i` is less than the value of `y` at index `i`, then the value of `x` at index `i` and the value of `y` at index `i` are printed. Otherwise, the ith element of the list `y` and the ith element of the list `x` are printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
