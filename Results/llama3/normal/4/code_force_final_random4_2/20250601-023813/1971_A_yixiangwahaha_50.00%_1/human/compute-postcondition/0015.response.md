Postcondition: ***`t` is a string, `x` is a list containing ten integers, `y` is a list containing ten integers, `i` is within the range from 0 to 9, the range is defined as 10, stdin is empty. For the current index `i`, if `x[i]` is less than `y[i]`, the values of `x[i]` and `y[i]` are printed. Otherwise, the values of `y[i]` and `x[i]` are printed.***
