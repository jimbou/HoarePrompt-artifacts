The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 10, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is within the range from 0 to 9. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1.
State: **`t` is a string, `x` is a list containing ten integers, `y` is a list containing ten integers, `i` is within the range from 1 to 9, the range is defined as 10, stdin is empty.**
