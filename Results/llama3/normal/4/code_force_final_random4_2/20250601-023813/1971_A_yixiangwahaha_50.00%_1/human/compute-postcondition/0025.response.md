The code prints the element at index `i` of the list `y`, followed by a space, and then the element at index `i` of the list `x`. Since `i` is within the range from 2 to 10, the printed elements will be the 3rd to 11th elements of the lists `y` and `x`, respectively.

Output: **y[i] (the (i+1)th element of the list y), x[i] (the (i+1)th element of the list x)**
