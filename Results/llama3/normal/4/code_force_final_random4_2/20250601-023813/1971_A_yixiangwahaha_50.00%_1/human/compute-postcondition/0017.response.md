The code prints the element at index `i` of the list `x`, followed by a space, and then the element at index `i` of the list `y`. Since `i` is within the range from 1 to 9, it will print the elements at indices 1 to 9 of both lists `x` and `y`.

Output: **x[i] (where i is an integer between 1 and 9), y[i] (where i is an integer between 1 and 9)**
