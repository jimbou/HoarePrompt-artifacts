Output State: **t is a string, x is a list containing two integers, y is a list containing two integers, i is 1, the range is defined as 10, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9)**

In this output state, the value of t remains unchanged as a string. The list x now contains two integers: the original integer and the new integer parsed from the input. Similarly, the list y also contains two integers: the original integer and the new integer parsed from the input. The value of i remains unchanged at 1. The range is still defined as 10. Stdin now contains t-1 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y, with the range of x and y being between 0 and 9.
