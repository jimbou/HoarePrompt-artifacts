Output State: **t is a string, x is a list containing three integers, y is a list containing three integers, i is 2, the range is defined as 10, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9)**

In this output state, the variable t remains unchanged as a string. The list x now contains three integers, with the first two integers being the original values and the third integer being the value read from the input. Similarly, the list y also contains three integers, with the first two integers being the original values and the third integer being the value read from the input. The variable i remains unchanged at 2. The range is still defined as 10. The stdin now contains t-2 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y, with the range of x and y being between 0 and 9.
