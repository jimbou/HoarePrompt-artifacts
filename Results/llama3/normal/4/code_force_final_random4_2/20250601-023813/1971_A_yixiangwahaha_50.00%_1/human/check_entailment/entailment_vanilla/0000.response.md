Reasoning:

1. The problem requires reading the number of test cases (t) and then for each test case, reading two integers x and y.
2. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (t) using the input() function.
3. However, the program assumes that the number of test cases is always 10, which is not necessarily true according to the problem description (1 ≤ t ≤ 100). This is a logical error.
4. The program correctly reads the two integers x and y for each test case using the input().split(' ') function and stores them in separate lists x and y.
5. The program then iterates over the lists x and y and prints the minimum and maximum values for each pair. This is correct.

However, due to the logical error in step 3, the program may not work correctly for all possible inputs.

Correctness: **False**
