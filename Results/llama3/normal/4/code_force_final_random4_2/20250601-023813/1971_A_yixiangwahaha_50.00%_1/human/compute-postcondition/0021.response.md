Postcondition: ***`t` is a string, `x` is a list containing ten integers, `y` is a list containing ten integers, `i` is within the range from 1 to 9, the range is defined as 10, stdin is empty. If the ith element of `x` is less than the ith element of `y`, then the ith element of `x` and the ith element of `y` are printed. Otherwise, the ith element of `y` and the ith element of `x` are printed.***
