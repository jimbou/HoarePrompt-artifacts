Output State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 100) followed by t lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9), t is a string, x is an empty list, y is an empty list.**

The code reads the first line from stdin and assigns it to the variable `t`. The value of `t` is a string representing an integer between 1 and 100. The remaining lines in stdin are still present, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` with values between 0 and 9. The variables `x` and `y` are initialized as empty lists.
