The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 10, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2.
State: **t is a string, x is a list containing two integers, y is a list containing two integers, i is 2, the range is defined as 10, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9)**
