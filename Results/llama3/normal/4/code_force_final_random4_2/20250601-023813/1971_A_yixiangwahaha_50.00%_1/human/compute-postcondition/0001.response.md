To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the range `10`. Since the loop will execute as long as the range is defined and `i` is within that range, we can adjust the states as follows:


State: **`stdin` contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 100) followed by t lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9), t is a string, x is an empty list, y is an empty list, `i` is 0, the range is defined as 10**
