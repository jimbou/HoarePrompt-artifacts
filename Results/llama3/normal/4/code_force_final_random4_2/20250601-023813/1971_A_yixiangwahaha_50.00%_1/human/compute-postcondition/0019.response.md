The code prints the element at index `i` of the list `y`, followed by a space, and then the element at index `i` of the list `x`. Since `i` is within the range from 1 to 9, it will print the `i-th` element of both lists.

Output: **the ith element of the list y, the ith element of the list x (where i is a value between 1 and 9)**
