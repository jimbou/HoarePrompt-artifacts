Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `max_item_idx` is the index of the maximum value that `func_1` returns '<' for, `ans1` is the value returned by `func_1` when called with arguments `max_item_idx`, `pair_idx`, `max_item_idx`, and `i`, `pair_idx` is 2, and the value of `ans2` depends on the value of `ans1`.**

In this output state, the value of `pair_idx` has been updated to 2, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged, and their values are still dependent on the initial conditions. The value of `ans2` still depends on the value of `ans1`, but its exact value is not specified.
