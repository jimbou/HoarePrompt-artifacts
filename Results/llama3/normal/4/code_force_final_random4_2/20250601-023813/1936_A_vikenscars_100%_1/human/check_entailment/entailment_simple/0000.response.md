Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program first finds the index of the maximum value in the secret sequence `p` using `func_1`. This is done by comparing each element with the current maximum element and updating the maximum index if a larger element is found.

2. Once the maximum index is found, the program then finds the index of the minimum value in the secret sequence `p` that has the maximum XOR with the maximum value. This is done by comparing each element with the current minimum element and updating the minimum index if a smaller element is found that has a larger XOR with the maximum value.

3. Finally, the program prints the indices of the maximum and minimum values that have the maximum XOR.

The program uses at most 3n queries, which is within the allowed limit. The queries are also correctly formatted and the program handles the responses from the jury correctly.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
