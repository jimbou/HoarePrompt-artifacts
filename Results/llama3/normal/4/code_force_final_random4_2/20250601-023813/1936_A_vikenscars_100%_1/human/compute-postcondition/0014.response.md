Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `max_item_idx` is the index of the maximum value that `func_1` returns '<' for, and `n` is unchanged.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `i` will be one less than the initial value of `n`, and the value of `max_item_idx` will be the index of the maximum value that the function `func_1` returns '<' for. The value of `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
