Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve an interactive problem where the goal is to find two indices `i` and `j` in a secret permutation `p` of length `n` such that the bitwise XOR operation `p_i ⊕ p_j` is maximized. The program uses a query-based approach to achieve this.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1.  **Function 1 (`func_1`):** This function takes four indices `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` as input and constructs a query string in the format `? a b c d`. It then prints this query and reads the response from the input stream using `input()`. The response is expected to be one of `<`, `=`, or `>`, indicating the result of the comparison between `(p_a | p_b)` and `(p_c | p_d)`.
2.  **Function 2 (`func_2`):** This function takes the length of the permutation `n` as input and performs the following steps:

    *   It initializes `max_item_idx` to 0, which will store the index of the maximum item found so far.
    *   It iterates over the range from 1 to `n-1` and compares the current maximum item (`max_item_idx`) with each item `i` using the `func_1` function. If the response is `<`, it updates `max_item_idx` to `i`.
    *   After finding the maximum item, it initializes `pair_idx` to `max_item_idx` and iterates over the range from 0 to `n-1`. For each item `i`, it compares the maximum item (`max_item_idx`) with `i` using `func_1`. If the response is `<`, it updates `pair_idx` to `i`. If the response is `=`, it further compares `pair_idx` with `i` using `func_1`. If the response is `>`, it updates `pair_idx` to `i`.
    *   Finally, it prints the result in the format `! max_item_idx pair_idx`, indicating the indices `i` and `j` that maximize the bitwise XOR operation `p_i ⊕ p_j`.

The program's logic is correct, and it uses at most `3n` queries to find the desired pair of indices. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
