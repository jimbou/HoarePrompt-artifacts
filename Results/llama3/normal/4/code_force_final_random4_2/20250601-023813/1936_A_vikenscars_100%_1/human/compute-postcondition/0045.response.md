Based on the initial state, we can analyze the print statement as follows:

* `max_item_idx` is the index of the maximum value that `func_1` returns '<' for. This means that `max_item_idx` holds the index of the maximum value that satisfies a certain condition defined by `func_1`.
* `pair_idx` is also the index of the maximum value that `func_1` returns '<' for. This means that `pair_idx` holds the same value as `max_item_idx`, as both are defined by the same condition.

Now, let's look at the print statement:
```
print(f'! {max_item_idx} {pair_idx}')
```
The print statement uses an f-string to format the output. The `!` is a literal character that will be printed as is. The `{max_item_idx}` and `{pair_idx}` are placeholders that will be replaced with the values of the corresponding variables.

Since `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx` hold the same value, the output will be:
```
! <index> <index>
```
Where `<index>` is the actual value of `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx`, which is the index of the maximum value that `func_1` returns '<' for.

Output: **! <index> <index> (where <index> is the index of the maximum value that func_1 returns '<' for)**
