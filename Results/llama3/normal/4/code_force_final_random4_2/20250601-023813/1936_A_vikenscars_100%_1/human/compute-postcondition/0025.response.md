Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `max_item_idx` is the index of the maximum value that `func_1` returns '<' for. If `ans2` is '>', then `pair_idx` is 0, `ans1` is '=', and `ans2` is '>' which is the value returned by `func_1` when called with arguments `pair_idx`, `pair_idx`, 0, and 0. Otherwise, `pair_idx` is the index of the maximum value that `func_1` returns '<' for, `ans1` is '=', and `ans2` is the value returned by `func_1` when called with arguments `pair_idx`, `pair_idx`, 0, and 0.***
