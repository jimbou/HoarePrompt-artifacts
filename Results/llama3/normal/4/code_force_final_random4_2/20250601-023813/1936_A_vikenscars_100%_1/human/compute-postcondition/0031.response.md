Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `max_item_idx` is the index of the maximum value that `func_1` returns '<' for, `ans1` is the value returned by `func_1` when called with arguments `max_item_idx`, `pair_idx`, `max_item_idx`, and `i`. If `ans1` is '<', then `pair_idx` is 0. If `ans1` is '=', then `pair_idx` is either 0 or the index of the maximum value that `func_1` returns '<' for, and `ans2` is the value returned by `func_1` when called with arguments `pair_idx`, `pair_idx`, `i`, and `i`. If `ans1` is not '<' and not '=', then `pair_idx` is the index of the maximum value that `func_1` returns '<' for, and `ans2` is the value returned by `func_1` when called with arguments `pair_idx`, `pair_idx`, `i`, and `i`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of `ans2` being assigned the value returned by `func_1` when called with arguments `pair_idx`, `pair_idx`, `i`, and `i`. The values of `i`, `n`, `max_item_idx`, `ans1`, and `pair_idx` remain the same as in the initial state.
