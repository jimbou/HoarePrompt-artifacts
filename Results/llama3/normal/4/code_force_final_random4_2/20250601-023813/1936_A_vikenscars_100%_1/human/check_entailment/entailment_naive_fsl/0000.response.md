Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is designed to solve the interactive problem of finding two indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i ⊕ p_j` is maximized, where `p` is a secret permutation of `{0, 1, ..., n-1}`. The program uses a query-based approach to compare the bitwise OR of pairs of elements in the permutation.

The program consists of two main functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` is used to send a query to the interactor and receive the result of the comparison between the bitwise OR of two pairs of elements. `func_2` is the main function that uses `func_1` to find the pair of indices that maximizes `p_i ⊕ p_j`.

The program works as follows:

1. `func_2` first finds the index of the maximum element in the permutation by comparing each element with the current maximum element using `func_1`.
2. Once the maximum element is found, `func_2` finds the pair of indices that maximizes `p_i ⊕ p_j` by comparing the bitwise OR of the maximum element with each other element in the permutation using `func_1`.
3. If the bitwise OR of the maximum element and another element is less than the bitwise OR of the maximum element and the current pair of indices, the program updates the pair of indices.
4. If the bitwise OR of the maximum element and another element is equal to the bitwise OR of the maximum element and the current pair of indices, the program checks if the bitwise OR of the other element and itself is greater than the bitwise OR of the current pair of indices. If it is, the program updates the pair of indices.
5. Finally, the program prints the pair of indices that maximizes `p_i ⊕ p_j`.

The program uses at most `3n` queries, which is within the allowed limit. The program also correctly handles the case where there are multiple pairs of indices that maximize `p_i ⊕ p_j`.

Overall, the program correctly implements the required functionality and follows the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
