Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `func_1` is a function that takes four non-negative integers less than `n` as arguments and returns a string that is either '<', '=', or '>'. If the current value of `ans` is '<', then `max_item_idx` is 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
