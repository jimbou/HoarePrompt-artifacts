Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `max_item_idx` is the index of the maximum value that `func_1` returns '<' for, `ans1` is the value returned by `func_1` when called with arguments `max_item_idx`, `pair_idx`, `max_item_idx`, and `i`. If `ans1` is '<', then `pair_idx` is 2. If `ans1` is '=', then `ans2` is the value returned by `func_1` when called with arguments `pair_idx`, `pair_idx`, `i`, and `i`. If `ans2` is '>', then `pair_idx` is 2. Otherwise, `pair_idx` is determined based on the value of `ans1`. If `ans1` is not '=' or '<', then the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
