Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n-1`, `max_item_idx` is the index of the maximum value that `func_1` returns '<' for, `n` is unchanged, and `pair_idx` is the index of the maximum value that `func_1` returns '<' for.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    ans1 = func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)
    if ans1 == '<':
        pair_idx = i
    elif ans1 == '=':
        ans2 = func_1(pair_idx, pair_idx, i, i)
        if ans2 == '>':
            pair_idx = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `max_item_idx` is the index of the maximum value that `func_1` returns '<' for. If `ans1` is '<', then `pair_idx` is 0. If `ans1` is '=', then `pair_idx` is either 0 or the index of the maximum value that `func_1` returns '<' for, and `ans2` is the value returned by `func_1` when called with arguments `pair_idx`, `pair_idx`, 0, and 0. If `ans1` is not '<' and not '=', then `pair_idx` is the index of the maximum value that `func_1` returns '<' for.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `max_item_idx` is the index of the maximum value that `func_1` returns '<' for. If `ans1` is '<', then `pair_idx` is either 0 or 1. If `ans1` is '=', then `pair_idx` is either 0, 1, or the index of the maximum value that `func_1` returns '<' for, and `ans2` is the value returned by `func_1` when called with arguments `pair_idx`, `pair_idx`, `i`, and `i`. If `ans1` is not '<' and not '=', then `pair_idx` is the index of the maximum value that `func_1` returns '<' for, and `ans2` is the value returned by `func_1` when called with arguments `pair_idx`, `pair_idx`, `i`, and `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `max_item_idx` is the index of the maximum value that `func_1` returns '<' for, `ans1` is the value returned by `func_1` when called with arguments `max_item_idx`, `pair_idx`, `max_item_idx`, and `i`. If `ans1` is '<', then `pair_idx` is 2. If `ans1` is '=', then `ans2` is the value returned by `func_1` when called with arguments `pair_idx`, `pair_idx`, `i`, and `i`. If `ans2` is '>', then `pair_idx` is 2. Otherwise, `pair_idx` is determined based on the value of `ans1`. If `ans1` is not '=' or '<', then the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
