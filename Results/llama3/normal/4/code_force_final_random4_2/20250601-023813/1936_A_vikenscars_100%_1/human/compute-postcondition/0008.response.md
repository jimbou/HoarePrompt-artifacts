The value of `max_item_idx` is updated to `i`, which is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. The value of `ans` depends on the value of `max_item_idx`, which is now 2. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `ans` is either '<', '=', or '>' depending on the value of `max_item_idx` which is 2, and `max_item_idx` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `ans` is either '<', '=', or '>' depending on the value of `max_item_idx` which is 2, and `max_item_idx` is 2.**
