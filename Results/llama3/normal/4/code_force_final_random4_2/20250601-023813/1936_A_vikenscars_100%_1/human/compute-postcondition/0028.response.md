The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `max_item_idx` is the index of the maximum value that `func_1` returns '<' for. If `ans1` is '<', then `pair_idx` is 0. If `ans1` is '=', then `pair_idx` is either 0 or the index of the maximum value that `func_1` returns '<' for, and `ans2` is the value returned by `func_1` when called with arguments `pair_idx`, `pair_idx`, 0, and 0. If `ans1` is not '<' and not '=', then `pair_idx` is the index of the maximum value that `func_1` returns '<' for.**
