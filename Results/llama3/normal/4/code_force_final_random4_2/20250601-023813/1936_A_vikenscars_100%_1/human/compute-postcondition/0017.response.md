Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `max_item_idx` is the index of the maximum value that `func_1` returns '<' for, `pair_idx` is the index of the maximum value that `func_1` returns '<' for, `ans1` is the value returned by `func_1` when called with arguments `max_item_idx`, `pair_idx`, `max_item_idx`, and 0.**

In this output state, the values of `i`, `n`, `max_item_idx`, and `pair_idx` remain unchanged. The new variable `ans1` is introduced, which holds the result of calling `func_1` with the specified arguments. The value of `ans1` depends on the implementation of `func_1`, which is not provided in the initial state.
