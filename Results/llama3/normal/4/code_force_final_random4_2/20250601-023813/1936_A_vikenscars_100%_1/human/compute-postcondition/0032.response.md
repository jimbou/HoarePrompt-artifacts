Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `max_item_idx` is the index of the maximum value that `func_1` returns '<' for, `ans1` is the value returned by `func_1` when called with arguments `max_item_idx`, `i`, `max_item_idx`, and `i`. If `ans1` is '<', then `pair_idx` is 1. If `ans1` is '=', then `pair_idx` is either 1 or the index of the maximum value that `func_1` returns '<' for, and `ans2` is the value returned by `func_1` when called with arguments `pair_idx`, `pair_idx`, `i`, and `i`. If `ans1` is not '<' and not '=', then `pair_idx` is the index of the maximum value that `func_1` returns '<' for, and `ans2` is the value returned by `func_1` when called with arguments `pair_idx`, `pair_idx`, `i`, and `i`.**

In this output state, the value of `pair_idx` has been updated to 1, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged, and their relationships with each other are still valid.
