Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `ans` is the return value of `func_1(3, 3, i, i)`, and `max_item_idx` is 3**

The code changes the value of `max_item_idx` to `i`, which is 3. The other variables are not affected by the code. The value of `ans` is still the return value of `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)`, but now `max_item_idx` is 3, so `ans` is the return value of `func_1(3, 3, i, i)`.
