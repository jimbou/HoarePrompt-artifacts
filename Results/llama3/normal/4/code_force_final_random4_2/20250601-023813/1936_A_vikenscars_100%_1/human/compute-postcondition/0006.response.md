To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head and the conditions that must be met for the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, n):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains unchanged, but since `i` is now 2, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables, `func_1`, `ans`, and `max_item_idx`, are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `func_1` is a function that takes four non-negative integers less than `n` as arguments and returns a string that is either '<', '=', or '>'. If the current value of `ans` is '<', then `max_item_idx` is 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
