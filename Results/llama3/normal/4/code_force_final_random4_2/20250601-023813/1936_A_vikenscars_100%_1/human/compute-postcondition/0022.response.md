Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `max_item_idx` is the index of the maximum value that `func_1` returns '<' for, `pair_idx` is the index of the maximum value that `func_1` returns '<' for, `ans1` is '=', and `ans2` is the value returned by `func_1` when called with arguments `pair_idx`, `pair_idx`, 0, and 0.**

In this output state, the value of `ans2` is determined by the result of calling `func_1` with the specified arguments, which are `pair_idx`, `pair_idx`, `i`, and `i`. Since `i` is 0, the arguments to `func_1` are effectively `pair_idx`, `pair_idx`, 0, and 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
