The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 2 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 2.
State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `max_item_idx` is the index of the maximum value that `func_1` returns '<' for. If `ans1` is '<', then `pair_idx` is either 0 or 1. If `ans1` is '=', then `pair_idx` is either 0, 1, or the index of the maximum value that `func_1` returns '<' for, and `ans2` is the value returned by `func_1` when called with arguments `pair_idx`, `pair_idx`, `i`, and `i`. If `ans1` is not '<' and not '=', then `pair_idx` is the index of the maximum value that `func_1` returns '<' for, and `ans2` is the value returned by `func_1` when called with arguments `pair_idx`, `pair_idx`, `i`, and `i`.**
