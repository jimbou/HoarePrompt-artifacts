Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `max_item_idx` is the index of the maximum value that `func_1` returns '<' for, `pair_idx` is 0, `ans1` is '=', and `ans2` is '>' which is the value returned by `func_1` when called with arguments `pair_idx`, `pair_idx`, 0, and 0.**

In this output state, the value of `pair_idx` has been updated to 0, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `pair_idx` is now equal to `i`, which is 0. The rest of the variables maintain their initial values and conditions.
