Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `max_item_idx` is the index of the maximum value that `func_1` returns '<' for, `ans1` is the value returned by `func_1` when called with arguments `max_item_idx`, `pair_idx`, `max_item_idx`, and `i`. If `ans1` is '<', then `pair_idx` is 0. If `ans1` is '=', then `pair_idx` is either 0 or the index of the maximum value that `func_1` returns '<' for, and `ans2` is the value returned by `func_1` when called with arguments `pair_idx`, `pair_idx`, 0, and 0. If `ans1` is not '<' and not '=', then `pair_idx` is the index of the maximum value that `func_1` returns '<' for.**

In this output state, the value of `ans1` is determined by the result of calling `func_1` with the specified arguments. The value of `pair_idx` is updated based on the value of `ans1`, and the value of `ans2` is updated if `ans1` is '='. The values of `i`, `n`, and `max_item_idx` remain unchanged.
