Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `max_item_idx` is the index of the maximum value that `func_1` returns '<' for, `ans1` is the value returned by `func_1` when called with arguments `max_item_idx`, `2`, `max_item_idx`, and `i`, `ans2` is the value returned by `func_1` when called with arguments `2`, `2`, `i`, and `i`, and `pair_idx` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `pair_idx` has been updated to 2, which is the current value of `i`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The precondition that `n` is greater than 2 and `max_item_idx` is the index of the maximum value that `func_1` returns '<' for is still valid. The values of `ans1` and `ans2` are still dependent on the value of `pair_idx`, which is now 2.
