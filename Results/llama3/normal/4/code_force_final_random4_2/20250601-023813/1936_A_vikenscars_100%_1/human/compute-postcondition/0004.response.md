Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `func_1` is a function that takes four non-negative integers less than `n` as arguments and returns a string that is either '<', '=', or '>', `max_item_idx` is 1, the current value of `ans` is '<'**

In this output state, the value of `max_item_idx` has been updated to 1, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The function `func_1` still takes four non-negative integers less than `n` as arguments and returns a string that is either '<', '=', or '>'. The value of `ans` is still '<'.
