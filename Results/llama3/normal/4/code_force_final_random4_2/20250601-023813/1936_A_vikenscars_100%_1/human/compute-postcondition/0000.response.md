Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `func_1` is a function that takes four non-negative integers less than `n` as arguments and returns a string that is either '<', '=', or '>', `max_item_idx` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `max_item_idx` has been updated to 0, while the values of `n` and `func_1` remain unchanged. The function `func_1` still takes four non-negative integers less than `n` as arguments and returns a string that is either '<', '=', or '>'.
