To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is `n-1`, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 0 (the starting value of the range).

Additionally, since `i` is `n-1` initially, we can infer that `n` must be greater than 0, otherwise, `i` would be negative.

State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `max_item_idx` is the index of the maximum value that `func_1` returns '<' for, `pair_idx` is the index of the maximum value that `func_1` returns '<' for**
