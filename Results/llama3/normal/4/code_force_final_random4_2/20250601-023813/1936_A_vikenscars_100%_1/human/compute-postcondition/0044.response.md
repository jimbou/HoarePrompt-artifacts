Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `max_item_idx` is the index of the maximum value that `func_1` returns '<' for, `n` is unchanged, and `pair_idx` is the index of the maximum value that `func_1` returns '<' for.**

This output state indicates that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `n-1`, which is the last index in the range of `n`. The value of `max_item_idx` remains unchanged, as it is not modified within the loop. The value of `n` also remains unchanged, as it is not modified within the loop. The value of `pair_idx` will be the index of the maximum value that `func_1` returns '<' for, which is determined by the comparisons made within the loop.
