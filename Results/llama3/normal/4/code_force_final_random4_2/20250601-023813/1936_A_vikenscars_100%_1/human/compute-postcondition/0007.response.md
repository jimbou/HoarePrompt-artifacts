Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. `ans` is assigned the value of `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)`.
2. `func_1` is a function that takes four non-negative integers less than `n` as arguments and returns a string that is either '<', '=', or '>'.
3. The current value of `ans` is '<' if `max_item_idx` is 1, otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

Since `i` is 2, the arguments passed to `func_1` are `max_item_idx`, `max_item_idx`, 2, and 2.

If `max_item_idx` is 1, then `ans` is '<'. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `ans` is either '<', '=', or '>' depending on the value of `max_item_idx`, and `max_item_idx` is either 1 or remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still at least 3, the value of `i` is still 2, and the value of `ans` is either '<', '=', or '>' depending on the value of `max_item_idx`. If `max_item_idx` is 1, then `ans` is '<', otherwise, the state of `max_item_idx` remains unchanged.
