According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 2 and `i` is now 1. 
State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `func_1` is a function that takes four non-negative integers less than `n` as arguments and returns a string that is either '<', '=', or '>', `max_item_idx` is 0**
