Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `max_item_idx` is the index of the maximum value that `func_1` returns '<' for, `ans1` is the value returned by `func_1` when called with arguments `max_item_idx`, `i`, `max_item_idx`, and `i`. If `ans1` is '<', then `pair_idx` is 1. If `ans1` is '=', then `pair_idx` is either 1 or the index of the maximum value that `func_1` returns '<' for, and `ans2` is the value returned by `func_1` when called with arguments `pair_idx`, `pair_idx`, 0, and 0. If `ans1` is not '<' and not '=', then `pair_idx` is the index of the maximum value that `func_1` returns '<' for.**

In this output state, the value of `pair_idx` has been updated to `i`, which is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `ans1` and `pair_idx` are still dependent on the value returned by `func_1` when called with the specified arguments.
