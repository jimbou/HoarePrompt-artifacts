Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `q` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` strings `s`, `s` is a string of length between 2 and 500 consisting of characters '0' and '1', `i` is 2. If the characters at positions `i` and `i+1` in string `s` are different, then `flag` is either 0 or 1, and `count` is either 1, 2 or 3. Otherwise, `flag` is either 0 or 1, and `count` is either 0, 1 or 2.***
