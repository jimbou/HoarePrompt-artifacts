Postcondition: ***t is at least 3, q is 2, stdin contains t-4 strings s, s is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting of characters '0' and '1', i is len(s) - 1. If flag is 0, the value of count + 1 is being printed, where count + 1 is between 1 and len(s). If flag is 1, count (where count is between 0 and len(s) - 1) is being printed.***
