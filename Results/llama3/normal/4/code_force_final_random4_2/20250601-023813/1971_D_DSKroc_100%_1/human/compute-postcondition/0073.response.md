Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 3, `q` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-4` strings `s`, `s` is a string of length between 3 and 500 consisting of characters '0' and '1', `i` is 2, `flag` is 1. If the characters at index `i` and `i+1` in string `s` are different and the character at index `i` is less than the character at index `i+1`, then the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition is not met. In both cases, if the characters at index `i` and `i+1` in string `s` are different, then `count` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, `count` is 1.***
