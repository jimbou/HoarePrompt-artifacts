Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `q` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings `s`, `s` is a string of length at least 2 consisting of characters '0' and '1', `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is different from the character at index `i + 1` in string `s`, then `count` is 1 and `flag` is 0. Otherwise, no changes are made to `count` and `flag`.***
