Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `q` is 0, `count` is either 2 or 3, `i` is 2, `s` is a string of length at least 3 consisting of characters '0' and '1', stdin contains `t-1` strings `s`. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `i + 1` in string `s`, then `count` is 3. Otherwise, `count` is 2. If the integer value of the character at index `i` in string `s` is less than the integer value of the character at index `i + 1` in string `s`, then `flag` is 1. Otherwise, `flag` remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been incremented by 1, so it is now either 2 or 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for `count` being 2 or 3 is still dependent on the characters at index `i` and `i + 1` in string `s`. The condition for `flag` being 1 or unchanged is also still dependent on the integer values of the characters at index `i` and `i + 1` in string `s`.
