Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `q` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings `s`, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting of characters '0' and '1', `i` is `len(s) - 1`, and the value of `count` or `count + 1` is being printed, where `count` is between 0 and `len(s) - 1` and `count + 1` is between 1 and `len(s)`. The value printed depends on the value of `flag`: if `flag` is 0, `count + 1` is printed, otherwise `count` is printed.***
