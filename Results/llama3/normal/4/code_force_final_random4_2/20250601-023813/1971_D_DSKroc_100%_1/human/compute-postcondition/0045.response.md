Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `q` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` strings `s`, `s` is a string of length between 2 and 500 consisting of characters '0' and '1', `i` is 2, `flag` is 1, and if the characters at positions `i` and `i+1` in string `s` are different, then `count` is either 1, 2 or 3. Otherwise, `count` is either 0, 1 or 2.**

In this output state, the value of `flag` has been updated to 1, while the values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The conditions on `count` still depend on whether the characters at positions `i` and `i+1` in string `s` are different or not.
