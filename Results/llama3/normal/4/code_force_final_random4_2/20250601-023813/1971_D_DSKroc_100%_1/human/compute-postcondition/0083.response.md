Functionality: **This function reads a series of binary strings from standard input, where the number of strings is specified by an initial integer. For each string, it counts the number of transitions from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0 and prints the total number of transitions plus one if the string is non-increasing, otherwise it prints the total number of transitions. The function processes all input strings and does not return any value.**
