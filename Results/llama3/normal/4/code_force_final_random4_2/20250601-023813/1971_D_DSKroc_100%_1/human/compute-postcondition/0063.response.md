Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 3, `q` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-4` strings `s`, `s` is a string of length between 2 and 500 consisting of characters '0' and '1', `i` is 0. If the current value of `s[i]` is less than the current value of `s[i + 1]`, then `count` is 1 and `flag` is 1. Otherwise, the values of `count` and `flag` remain unchanged.***
