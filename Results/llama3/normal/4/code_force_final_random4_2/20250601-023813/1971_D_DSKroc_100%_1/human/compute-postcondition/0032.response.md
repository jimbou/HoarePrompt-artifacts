Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `q` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` strings `s`, `s` is a string of length between 2 and 500 consisting of characters '0' and '1', `i` is 0, `count` is 1, `flag` is 0. The current value of `s[i]` is different from the current value of `s[i + 1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `count` has been incremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The string `s` still has a length between 2 and 500 and consists of characters '0' and '1'. The current character at index `i` of string `s` is still different from the character at index `i+1`.
