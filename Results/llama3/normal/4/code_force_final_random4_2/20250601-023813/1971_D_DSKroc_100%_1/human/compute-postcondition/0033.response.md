Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `q` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` strings `s`, `s` is a string of length between 2 and 500 consisting of characters '0' and '1', `i` is 0, if the current value of `s[i]` is different from the current value of `s[i + 1]`, then `count` is 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
