Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of pieces needed to cut the binary string into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string.

The program iterates through the string, counting the number of times the character changes from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0. This count represents the minimum number of cuts needed to separate the string into pieces that can be rearranged into a sorted binary string.

The program also checks if the string is already sorted (i.e., all 0s come before all 1s) by checking if the flag is 0. If the string is already sorted, the program prints the count + 1, which is the minimum number of pieces needed (i.e., 1 piece).

The program handles all possible cases, including:

* Strings with only 0s or only 1s
* Strings with alternating 0s and 1s
* Strings with consecutive 0s or 1s
* Strings with a mix of 0s and 1s

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
