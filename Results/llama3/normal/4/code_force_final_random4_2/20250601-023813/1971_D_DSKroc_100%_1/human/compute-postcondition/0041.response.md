Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `q` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` strings `s`, `s` is a string of length between 2 and 500 consisting of characters '0' and '1', `i` is 1. If the current value of `s[i]` is less than the current value of `s[i + 1]`, then `flag` is 1 and the value of `count` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `s[i]` is different from `s[i + 1]`. If the current value of `s[i]` is not less than the current value of `s[i + 1]`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
