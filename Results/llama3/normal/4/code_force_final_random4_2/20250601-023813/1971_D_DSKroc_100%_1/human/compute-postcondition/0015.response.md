State: **`t` is at least 1, `q` is 0, `count` is either 1 or 2, `i` is 2, `s` is a string of length at least 3 consisting of characters '0' and '1', stdin contains `t-1` strings `s`. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `i + 1` in string `s`, then `count` is 2. Otherwise, `count` is 1. If the integer value of the character at index `i` in string `s` is less than the integer value of the character at index `i + 1` in string `s`, then `flag` is 1. Otherwise, `flag` remains unchanged.**
