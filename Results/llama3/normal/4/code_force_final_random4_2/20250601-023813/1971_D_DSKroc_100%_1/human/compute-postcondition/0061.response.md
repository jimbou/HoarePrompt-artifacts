Postcondition: **`t` is at least 3, `q` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-4` strings `s`, `s` is a string of length between 2 and 500 consisting of characters '0' and '1', `i` is 0, if the current value of `s[i]` is not equal to the current value of `s[i + 1]`, then the current value of `count` is 1, otherwise the current value of `count` remains 0, and the current value of `flag` is 0. Additionally, the current value of `s[i]` is less than the current value of `s[i + 1]`.**
