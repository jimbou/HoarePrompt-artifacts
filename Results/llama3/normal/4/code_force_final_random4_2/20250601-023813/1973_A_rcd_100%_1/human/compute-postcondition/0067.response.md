Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers, stdin is empty. If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, -1 is printed and the rest of the code in the current loop iteration is skipped, moving to the next iteration. If `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1` + `p2`, the sum of `p1` and `p2` is printed. Otherwise, `p1`, `p2` are integers, `p3` is greater than or equal to 0, `y` is greater than or equal to 0, and `x` is either 0 or a positive integer.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged. The values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are updated to the integers read from the input. The stdin is now empty. The rest of the conditions related to the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, and the values of `y` and `x` remain the same as in the initial state.
