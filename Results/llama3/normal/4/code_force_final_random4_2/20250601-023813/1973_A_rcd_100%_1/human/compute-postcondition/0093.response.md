Output State: **t is an integer greater than 2, _ is 2, p1, p2, p3 are integers, x is either 1, 2, or 3, y is greater than or equal to 1**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been incremented by 1, so it can now be 1, 2, or 3. The value of `y` has been decremented by 1, so it is now greater than or equal to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
