Output: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is an even number, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2` and `p3` must be greater than or equal to 1, `x` is 1, `y` is greater than or equal to 1, and this is printed: `p1 - x + p3` which is equal to `p1 - 1 + p3`**
