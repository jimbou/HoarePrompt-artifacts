Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is an even number, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2` and `p3` must be greater than or equal to 1. If `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `x` is 1, `y` is greater than or equal to 1. Otherwise, `x` is 2, `y` is greater than or equal to 0.***
