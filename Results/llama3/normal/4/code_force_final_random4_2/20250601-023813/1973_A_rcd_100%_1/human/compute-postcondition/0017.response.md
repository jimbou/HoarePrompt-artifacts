Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is an even number, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2` and `p3` must be greater than or equal to 0, `x` is 0, `y` is `p3`. The current value of `p1` minus `x` is less than or equal to the current value of `p2` minus `y`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, because the `break` statement does not change any variable values. However, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
