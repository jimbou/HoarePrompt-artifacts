The variables in the loop head are `y` and `x`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `y` and `x`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is `p3 - 1` and `x` is 1. Since `p3` is greater than or equal to 0, `y` is greater than or equal to -1. However, this does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so `y` needs to be adjusted to `y` is greater than or equal to 1. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is an even number, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2` and `p3` must be greater than or equal to 1, `x` is 1, `y` is greater than or equal to 1**
