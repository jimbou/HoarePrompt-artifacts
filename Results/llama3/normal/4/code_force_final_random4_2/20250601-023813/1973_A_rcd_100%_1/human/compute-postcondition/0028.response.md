The code prints the value of `p1` minus `x` plus `p3`. Since `x` is either 1 or 2, we have two possible scenarios:

1. If `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`, then `x` is 1. In this case, the expression `p1 - x + p3` becomes `p1 - 1 + p3`.
2. Otherwise, `x` is 2. In this case, the expression `p1 - x + p3` becomes `p1 - 2 + p3`.

In both cases, the value of `p1`, `p3` is an integer, and the result of the expression is an integer.

Output: **p1 - 1 + p3 (if p1 - x is less than or equal to p2 - y) or p1 - 2 + p3 (otherwise)**
