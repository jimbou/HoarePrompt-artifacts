Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is an even number, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2` and `p3` must be greater than or equal to 1, `x` is 1, `y` is greater than or equal to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged, and the conditions on `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `x`, and `y` are still valid. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
