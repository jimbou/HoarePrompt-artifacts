To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `y >= x`.

Given the state right before the loop:

- `t` is an integer greater than 1
- `_` is 1
- `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers
- `x` is 0
- `y` is `p3`

The loop condition is `y >= x`. Since `x` is 0, for the loop to execute at least once, `y` must be greater than or equal to 0. Given that `y` is `p3`, we need to ensure that `p3` is greater than or equal to 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state adjustment needed is that `p3` (and thus `y`) must be greater than or equal to 0.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2` are integers, `p3` (and thus `y`) must be greater than or equal to 0, `x` is 0**
