Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged. The code assigns the values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` to the integers obtained from the input, which is a space-separated list of integers. The stdin is now empty since it has been used to obtain the input.
