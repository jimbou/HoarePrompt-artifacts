Based on the precondition, we can analyze the print statement as follows:

The print statement is `print(p1 - x + p3)`. 

From the precondition, we know that `x` is 0. Therefore, the expression `p1 - x` simplifies to `p1`.

The value of `p3` is not explicitly given, but it is described as an integer.

So, the print statement will output the sum of `p1` and `p3`.

Output: **p1 + p3 (where p1 and p3 are integers)**
