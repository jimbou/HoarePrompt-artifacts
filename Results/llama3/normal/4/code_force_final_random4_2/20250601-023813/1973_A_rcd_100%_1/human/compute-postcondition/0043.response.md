Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, _ is 1, p1, p2, p3 are integers, x is 0, y is p3**

The code initializes `x` to 0 and assigns the value of `p3` to `y`. The values of `t`, `_`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The program does not print anything or skip any code in this iteration since the condition for printing -1 and skipping the rest of the code is not met.
