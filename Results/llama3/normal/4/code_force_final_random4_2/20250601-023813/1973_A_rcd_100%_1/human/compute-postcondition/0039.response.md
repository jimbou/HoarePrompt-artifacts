Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers that are assigned values from the input, stdin is empty, and -1 is being printed, and we skip the rest of the code in the current loop iteration and move to the next iteration.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip the rest of the code in the current loop iteration and move to the next iteration due to the `continue` statement. The values of the variables `t`, `_`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain the same, and the stdin remains empty. The `-1` is still being printed.
