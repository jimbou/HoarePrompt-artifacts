Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers that are assigned values from the input, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged. The variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are assigned new values from the input, which is a space-separated list of integers. Since the input is consumed, the stdin is now empty.
