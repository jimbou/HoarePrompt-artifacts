The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the stdin and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the stdin contains multiple test cases, the first test case is consumed, and the remaining test cases are still in the stdin.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**
