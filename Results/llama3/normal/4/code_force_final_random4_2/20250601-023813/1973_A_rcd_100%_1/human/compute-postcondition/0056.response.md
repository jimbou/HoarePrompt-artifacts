Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, _ is 1, p1, p2 are integers, p3 is greater than or equal to 0, y is greater than or equal to 0, x is 1**

The code increments `x` by 1, making it equal to 1. The second line decrements `y` by 1, making it greater than or equal to 0. Since `p3` is greater than or equal to 1, `y` is also greater than or equal to 0. No other variables are affected.
