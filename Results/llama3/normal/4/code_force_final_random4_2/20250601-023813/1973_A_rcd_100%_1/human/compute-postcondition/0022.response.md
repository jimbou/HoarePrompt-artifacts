The code prints the result of the expression `p1 - x + p3`. Based on the initial state, we know that `x` is 1, so the expression simplifies to `p1 - 1 + p3`.

Since `p1` and `p3` are integers, the result of the expression will be an integer. However, we cannot determine the exact value of the result without knowing the specific values of `p1` and `p3`.

Output: **p1 - 1 + p3 (where p1 and p3 are integers)**
