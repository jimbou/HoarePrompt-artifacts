Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers, stdin is empty. If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, -1 is printed. Otherwise, `p1`, `p2` are integers, `p3` is greater than or equal to 0, `y` is greater than or equal to 0, and `x` is either 0 or a positive integer.***
