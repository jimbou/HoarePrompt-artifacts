Output State: **`t` is 0, `_` is `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers, stdin is empty. If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, -1 is printed. Otherwise, `p1`, `p2` are integers, `p3` is greater than or equal to 0, `y` is greater than or equal to 0, and `x` is either 0 or a positive integer. If `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1` + `p2`, the sum of `p1` and `p2` is printed. If `p3` is less than `p1` + `p2`, then if `p1` - `x` is less than or equal to `p2` - `y`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement with `x` being 0, 1, 2, or 3, and `y` being greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise, `x` is 1, 2, or 3, and `y` is greater than or equal to 1.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the value of `t` has been decremented to 0. The loop variable `_` has reached its final value, which is equal to the initial value of `t`. The input has been fully consumed, leaving stdin empty. The variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` retain their last assigned values as integers. If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, -1 has been printed. Otherwise, the program has either printed the sum of `p1` and `p2` if `p3` is greater than or equal to their sum, or it has broken out of the inner loop with specific values of `x` and `y` if `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`.
