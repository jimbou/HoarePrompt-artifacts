The code prints the result of the expression `p1 - x + p3`. Based on the initial state, we know that `x` is 0, so the expression simplifies to `p1 + p3`.

Since `p1` and `p3` are integers, the result of the expression will be an integer. However, we don't know the exact values of `p1` and `p3`, so we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expression.

Therefore, the output will be the sum of `p1` and `p3`, where `p1` is an integer and `p3` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.

Output: **p1 + p3 (where p1 is an integer and p3 is an integer greater than or equal to 1)**
