Output: **t is an integer greater than 2, _ is 2, p1, p2, p3 are integers. If (p1 - x) is less than or equal to (p2 - y), then x is 0, y is greater than or equal to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, x is 1, y is greater than or equal to 1, and this is printed: p1 - x + p3, where x is either 0 or 1 depending on the condition (p1 - x) is less than or equal to (p2 - y) and p1, p3 are integers**
