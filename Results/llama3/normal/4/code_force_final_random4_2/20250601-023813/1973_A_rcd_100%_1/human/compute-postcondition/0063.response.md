Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 1, _ is 1, p1, p2 are integers, p3 is greater than or equal to 0, y is greater than or equal to 1, and x is either 0 or 1. If p1 - x is less than or equal to p2 - y, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, t is an integer greater than 1, _ is 1, p1, p2 are integers, p3 is greater than or equal to 0, y is greater than or equal to 0, and x is either 1 or 2.***
