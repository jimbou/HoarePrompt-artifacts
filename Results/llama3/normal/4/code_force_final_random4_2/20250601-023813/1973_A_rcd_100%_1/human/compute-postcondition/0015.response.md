The code prints the value of `p1` minus `x` plus `p3`. Since `x` is 0, the expression simplifies to `p1` plus `p3`. Therefore, the print statement will output the sum of `p1` and `p3`.

Output: **p1 + p3 (where p1 and p3 are integers and p1 + p3 is part of the sum of p1, p2, and p3 which is an even number)**
