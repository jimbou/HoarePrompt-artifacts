According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable y and x. If y is greater than or equal to x, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, y is greater than or equal to -1 and x is 1. y being greater than or equal to -1 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to y is greater than or equal to 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **t is an integer greater than 2, _ is 2, p1, p2, p3 are integers. If (p1 - x) is less than or equal to (p2 - y), then x is 0, y is greater than or equal to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, x is 1, y is greater than or equal to 1.**
