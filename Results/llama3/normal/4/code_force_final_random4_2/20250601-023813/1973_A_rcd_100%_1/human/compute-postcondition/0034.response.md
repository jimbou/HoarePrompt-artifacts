Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers. If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is an odd number, -1 has been printed and the rest of the current iteration is skipped. Otherwise, no action is taken. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the sum of `p1` and `p2` is printed. If `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`, `x` is equal to `y`.***
