Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers that are assigned values from the input, stdin is empty. If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, -1 is printed and the rest of the code in the current loop iteration is skipped, moving to the next iteration. If `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1` + `p2`, the sum of `p1` and `p2` is printed. Otherwise, `p1`, `p2` are integers, `p3` is greater than or equal to 0, `y` is greater than or equal to 0, and `x` is either 0 or a positive integer.***
