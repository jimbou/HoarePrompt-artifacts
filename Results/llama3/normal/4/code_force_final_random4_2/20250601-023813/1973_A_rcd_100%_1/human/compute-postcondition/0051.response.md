Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2` are integers, `p3` (and thus `y`) is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is 0. If the current value of `p1` minus `x` is less than or equal to `p2` minus `y`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `x` is 1, `p3` (and thus `y`) is greater than or equal to -1, and `p1` - `x` is greater than or equal to `p2` - `y`.***
