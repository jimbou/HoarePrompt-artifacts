Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers. The current value of the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is an odd number, -1 has been printed, and we skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `t`, `_`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged, as the `continue` statement does not affect their values. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is still an odd number, and -1 has been printed. The only change is that we skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.
