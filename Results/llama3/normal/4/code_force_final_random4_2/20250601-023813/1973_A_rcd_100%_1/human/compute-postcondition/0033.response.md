Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0, p1, p2, p3 are integers, the sum of p1, p2, and p3 is an even number, p3 is less than p1 + p2 and p3 must be greater than or equal to 0. x is equal to y.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of x is equal to the value of y. The other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body remain unchanged.
