Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle all possible cases. For example, when the input is (1, 1, 3), the program outputs 2, but the correct output should be -1. This is because there is no way to obtain the scores (1, 1, 3) as a result of a non-negative number of games between the three players.

In the program, the condition `if p3 >= p1 + p2` is not sufficient to determine whether the scores are valid. The program also needs to check whether the difference between the scores of the two players with the highest scores is at most the score of the player with the lowest score.

Additionally, the while loop in the program is not necessary and can be simplified. The program can directly calculate the maximum possible number of draws based on the scores of the three players.

A correct implementation of the program would involve checking all possible cases and handling them correctly. For example, the program could use the following logic:

* If the sum of the scores is odd, output -1.
* If the highest score is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores, output the sum of the other two scores.
* Otherwise, calculate the maximum possible number of draws based on the scores of the three players.

Here is an example of a correct implementation:
```
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
        else:
            max_draws = min(p1, p2)
            if p3 - max_draws >= p1 - max_draws and p3 - max_draws >= p2 - max_draws:
                print(max_draws)
            else:
                print(-1)
```
This implementation correctly handles all possible cases and outputs the maximum possible number of draws for each input.
