Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2` are integers, `p3` (and thus `y`) is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is 0. The current value of `p1` minus `x` is less than or equal to `p2` minus `y`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The relationship between `p1`, `p2`, `x`, and `y` is still valid, and the value of `p1` plus `p3` is still printed.
