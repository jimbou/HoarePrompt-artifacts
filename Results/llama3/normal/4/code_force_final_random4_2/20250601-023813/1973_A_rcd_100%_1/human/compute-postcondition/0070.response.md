The code `continue` skips the rest of the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration of the loop. Since there are no changes to the variables or stdin, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers, stdin is empty, and -1 is printed**
