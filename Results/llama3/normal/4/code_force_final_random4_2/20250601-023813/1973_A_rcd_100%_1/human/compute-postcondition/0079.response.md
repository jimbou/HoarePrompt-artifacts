Output State: **t is an integer greater than 2, _ is 2, p1, p2, p3 are integers, x is 0, y is greater than or equal to 0, (p1 - x) is less than or equal to (p2 - y), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all the variables maintain their initial values, and the condition (p1 - x) is less than or equal to (p2 - y) remains valid. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
