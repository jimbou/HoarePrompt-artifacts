Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, _ is 1, p1, p2 are integers, p3 is greater than or equal to 0, y is greater than or equal to 0, and x is either 1 or 2**

The code increments `x` by 1 and decrements `y` by 1. Since `x` is initially either 0 or 1, it becomes either 1 or 2 after the first line. The second line decrements `y` by 1, making it greater than or equal to 0. The values of `t`, `_`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged.
