To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `y` and `x` since they are the variables in the loop head.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `y` is greater than or equal to `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 0, and `y` is greater than or equal to 0. However, `y` being greater than or equal to 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `y` is greater than or equal to 1.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2` are integers, `p3` (and thus `y`) is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is 0**
