Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0, p1, p2, p3 are integers. The sum of p1, p2, and p3 is an even number. p3 is less than p1 + p2, x is 0, y is p3**

The code assigns the value of 0 to `x` and the value of `p3` to `y`. No other variables are affected. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remains an even number, and `p3` remains less than `p1 + p2`.
