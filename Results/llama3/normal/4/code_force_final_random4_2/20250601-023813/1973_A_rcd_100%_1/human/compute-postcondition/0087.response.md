Output State: **t is an integer greater than 2, _ is 2, p1, p2, p3 are integers. If (p1 - x) is less than or equal to (p2 - y), then x is 1, y is greater than or equal to -1, otherwise x is 2, y is greater than or equal to 0.**

In this output state, the value of x has been incremented by 1, and the value of y has been decremented by 1. The other variables, t, _, p1, p2, and p3, remain unchanged. The conditions for x and y have also been updated to reflect their new values.
