Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2` are integers, `p3` is greater than or equal to 0, `y` is greater than or equal to 0, and `x` is either 0 or 1. If `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `x` is set to 1.**
