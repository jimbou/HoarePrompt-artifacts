The code prints the result of the expression `p1 - x + p3`. Based on the initial state, we can describe the values of the variables involved:

* `p1` is an integer.
* `x` is either 0 or 1.
* `p3` is an integer greater than or equal to 0.

Since `x` can be either 0 or 1, the expression `p1 - x` can result in either `p1` (if `x` is 0) or `p1 - 1` (if `x` is 1).

Adding `p3` to this result will give us a value that is either `p1 + p3` (if `x` is 0) or `p1 - 1 + p3` (if `x` is 1).

Therefore, the output will be either `p1 + p3` or `p1 - 1 + p3`, depending on the value of `x`.

Output: **p1 + p3 (if x is 0) or p1 - 1 + p3 (if x is 1)**
