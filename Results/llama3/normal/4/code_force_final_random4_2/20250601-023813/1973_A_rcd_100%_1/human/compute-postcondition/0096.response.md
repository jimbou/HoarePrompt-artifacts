Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers, stdin is empty. If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, -1 is printed. Otherwise, `p1`, `p2` are integers, `p3` is greater than or equal to 0, `y` is greater than or equal to 0, and `x` is either 0 or a positive integer. If `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1` + `p2`, the sum of `p1` and `p2` is printed. If `p3` is less than `p1` + `p2`, then if `p1` - `x` is less than or equal to `p2` - `y`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement with `x` being 0, 1, 2, or 3, and `y` being greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise, `x` is 1, 2, or 3, and `y` is greater than or equal to 1.***
