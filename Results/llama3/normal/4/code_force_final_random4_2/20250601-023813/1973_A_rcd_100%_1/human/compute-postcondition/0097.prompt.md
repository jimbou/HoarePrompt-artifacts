Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())
    if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
        print(-1)
        continue
    if p3 >= p1 + p2:
        print(p1 + p2)
    else:
        x = 0
        y = p3
        while y >= x:
            if p1 - x <= p2 - y:
                print(p1 - x + p3)
                break
            else:
                x += 1
                y -= 1
        else:
            print(p3)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers. If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is an odd number, -1 has been printed and the rest of the current iteration is skipped. Otherwise, no action is taken. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the sum of `p1` and `p2` is printed. If `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`, `x` is equal to `y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers that are assigned values from the input, stdin is empty. If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, -1 is printed and the rest of the code in the current loop iteration is skipped, moving to the next iteration. If `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1` + `p2`, the sum of `p1` and `p2` is printed. Otherwise, `p1`, `p2` are integers, `p3` is greater than or equal to 0, `y` is greater than or equal to 0, and `x` is either 0 or a positive integer.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers, stdin is empty. If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, -1 is printed. Otherwise, `p1`, `p2` are integers, `p3` is greater than or equal to 0, `y` is greater than or equal to 0, and `x` is either 0 or a positive integer. If `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1` + `p2`, the sum of `p1` and `p2` is printed. If `p3` is less than `p1` + `p2`, then if `p1` - `x` is less than or equal to `p2` - `y`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement with `x` being 0, 1, 2, or 3, and `y` being greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise, `x` is 1, 2, or 3, and `y` is greater than or equal to 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
