To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to examine the condition `y >= x`. Given the state right before the loop:

- `t` is an integer greater than 0
- `_` is 0
- `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is an even number
- `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`
- `x` is 0
- `y` is `p3`

The condition `y >= x` depends on the values of `y` and `x`. Since `x` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time, `y` must be greater than or equal to 0. Given that `y` is `p3`, we need to ensure that `p3` is greater than or equal to 0.

However, the current state of `p3` is only defined as being less than `p1 + p2`, which does not guarantee that it is greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `p3` to ensure it is greater than or equal to 0 for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is an even number, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2` and `p3` must be greater than or equal to 0, `x` is 0, `y` is `p3`**
