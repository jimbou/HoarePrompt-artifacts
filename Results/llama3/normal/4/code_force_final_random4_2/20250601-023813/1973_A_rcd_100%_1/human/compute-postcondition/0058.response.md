To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `y` and `x` since they are the variables in the loop head.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `y >= x`. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is greater than or equal to 0, and `x` is either 0 or 1.

To guarantee that the loop can execute again, we need to ensure that `y` is greater than or equal to `x`. Since `x` can be either 0 or 1, we need to adjust `y` to be greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2` are integers, `p3` is greater than or equal to 0, `y` is greater than or equal to 1, and `x` is either 0 or 1**
