Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers representing the scores of three players. It then determines the maximum possible score that can be achieved by the first two players, either by summing their scores or by finding a combination of scores that satisfies certain conditions. If the sum of the three scores is odd, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the maximum possible score that can be achieved by the first two players. The function processes all test cases and prints the results accordingly.**
