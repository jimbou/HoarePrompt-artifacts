Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, _ is 1, p1, p2 are integers, p3 is greater than or equal to 0, y is greater than or equal to 0, and x is either 0 or a positive integer.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `t` remains an integer greater than 1, `_` remains 1, `p1` and `p2` remain integers, `p3` remains greater than or equal to 0, `y` remains greater than or equal to 0, and `x` is either 0 or a positive integer. The loop will continue to execute until `y` is less than `x`, at which point it will terminate. The values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` do not change during the loop, so they remain unchanged in the output state. The value of `x` will increase by 1 each iteration, and the value of `y` will decrease by 1 each iteration, until the loop terminates.
