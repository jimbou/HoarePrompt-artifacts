Output State: **t is an integer greater than 2, _ is 2, p1, p2, p3 are integers, x is 0, y is greater than or equal to 0.**

The code initializes `x` to 0 and assigns the value of `p3` to `y`. Since `p3` is an integer, `y` becomes an integer greater than or equal to 0. The values of `t`, `_`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged.
