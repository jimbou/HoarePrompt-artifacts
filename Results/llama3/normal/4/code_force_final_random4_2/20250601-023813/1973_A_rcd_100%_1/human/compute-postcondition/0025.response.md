Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0, p1, p2, p3 are integers, the sum of p1, p2, and p3 is an even number, p3 is less than p1 + p2 and p3 must be greater than or equal to 1, x is 2, y is greater than or equal to 0**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is still an even number, and `p3` is still less than `p1 + p2` and greater than or equal to 1. The value of `x` is incremented by 1, making it 2. The value of `y` is decremented by 1, making it greater than or equal to 0.
