Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2` are integers, `p3` is greater than or equal to 0, `y` is greater than or equal to 1, and `x` is either 0 or 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `t`, `_`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `y`, and `x` remain unchanged. The only effect of the `break` statement is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement we were directly inside. The value of `p1 - x + p3` is no longer being printed.
