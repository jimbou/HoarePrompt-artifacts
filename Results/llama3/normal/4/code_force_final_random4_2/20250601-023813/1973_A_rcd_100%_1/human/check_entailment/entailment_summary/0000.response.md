Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly handles the problem of determining the maximum number of draws that could have happened in a series of chess games between three friends. The program first checks if the sum of the scores is odd, in which case it prints -1 as the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games and results. 

If the sum of the scores is even, the program then checks if the score of the third player is greater than or equal to the sum of the scores of the first two players. If this condition is true, it prints the sum of the scores of the first two players as the maximum possible number of draws.

If the score of the third player is less than the sum of the scores of the first two players, the program then enters a while loop where it tries to find a combination of scores that satisfies certain conditions. If such a combination is found, it prints the maximum possible number of draws. If no such combination is found, it prints the score of the third player.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct results accordingly.

Correctness: **True**
