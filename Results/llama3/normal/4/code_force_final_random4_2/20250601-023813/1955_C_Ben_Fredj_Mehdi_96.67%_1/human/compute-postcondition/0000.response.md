The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by `t` test cases. Since `t` is assigned the value of the first integer in the input, the remaining input will be `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= k <= 10^15). The second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^4), stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= k <= 10^15). The second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).**
