Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 2, z is 2, n is an integer equal to the first integer in the first line of the first test case, k is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of the first test case and must be at least 2, a is a list of integers from the second line of the first test case where the first and last elements are each decremented by 2, d is an integer equal to the length of a minus 1, g is either -1 or 0 depending on whether the first element of a is 0, stdin contains t-3 test cases, and i is 1. If the last element of a is 0, then the state of the program remains unchanged and d is updated to the length of a minus 2. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
