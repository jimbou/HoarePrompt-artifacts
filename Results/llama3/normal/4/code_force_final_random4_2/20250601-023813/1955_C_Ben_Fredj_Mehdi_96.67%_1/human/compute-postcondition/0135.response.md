Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 0, z is 0, n is an integer, a is a list of integers, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If k equals 1999999998, the value 0 is printed. Otherwise, if k equals 1999999999, the number 1 is printed. If k equals 99999999999, '99' is printed. If n is 1, k is 10000000000000, and the first element of a is 1, then the number 1 is printed. If k equals 9999999999, '9' is printed. If n equals 101 and k equals 100000000000, the number 1 is printed. If k equals 10000000000000, either n is not equal to 1 or the first element of a is not equal to 1, and either n is not equal to 101, then the number 10000 is printed. If k equals 99999999999999, the number 99999 is printed. If k equals 199999999999999, the number 199999 is printed. If k equals 1000000000000, '1000' is printed. If k equals 200000000000, the number 200 is printed. If k equals 2147483648 and n equals 2, '2' is printed. If n equals 2, k equals 1000000000, and a equals [1000000000, 1000000000], 0 is printed. If n equals 5 and k equals 2147483648, the number 2 is printed. If n equals 20 and k equals 10000000000, the number 10 is printed. If k equals 5999999999, '5' is printed. If k equals 4294967295, the number 8 is printed. If n equals 2, k equals a[0] - 1, and k equals a[1] - 2, 0 is printed. If k equals 3000000000, 2 is printed. If k is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in a, the length of the list a which is equal to n is printed. Otherwise, the loop terminates when `i` equals `k // 2`. `a[g]` and `a[d]` are decremented by `k // 2` unless they are 0, in which case they are decremented by `k // 2` plus the number of times they were 0. `g` is incremented by the number of times `a[g]` is 0, and `d` is decremented by the number of times `a[d]` is 0. If `k` is odd, `a[g]` is additionally decremented by 1, and the number of zeros in the list `a` is printed.***
