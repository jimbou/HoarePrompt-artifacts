Postcondition: **t is an integer greater than 1, z is 1, n is an integer equal to the first integer in the first line of the first test case, k is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of the first test case, a is a list of integers from the second line of the first test case, stdin contains t-3 test cases. If k is equal to 5999999999, the number 5 is printed. Otherwise, if k is equal to 4294967295, the number 8 is printed. If n is 2, k is equal to a[0] - 1, and k is equal to a[1] - 2, then the number 0 is printed. If k is equal to 3000000000, the number 2 is printed. If k is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in list a, the length of the list a which is equal to n is printed. If k is less than the sum of the elements in list a, the first and last elements of list a are each decremented by k // 2 if no exception occurs, and the number of occurrences of 0 in list a is printed after the element at index k // 2 - 1 is decremented by 1 if k is odd.**
