Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `z` is 2, `n` is an integer equal to the first integer in the first line of the first test case, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of the first test case and must be at least 4, `a` is a list of integers from the second line of the first test case where the first and last elements are each decremented by 3, `d` is an integer equal to the length of `a` minus 2, `g` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the first element of `a` is 0 or not, `i` is 2, and stdin contains t-3 test cases. If the first element of `a` is 0, then `g` is 0, otherwise `g` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `d` has been decremented by 1, so it is now equal to the length of `a` minus 2. All other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-3 test cases.
