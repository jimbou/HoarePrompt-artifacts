The program could raise an exception if the list `a` is empty or if the elements at indices `g` and `d` are not integers. If no exception occurs, the first and last elements of the list `a` are decremented by 1. If the first element of `a` becomes 0, the value of `g` is incremented by 1. If the last element of `a` becomes 0, the value of `d` is decremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `z` is 2, `n` is an integer equal to the first integer in the first line of the first test case, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of the first test case and must be at least 2, `a` is a list of integers from the second line of the first test case where the first and last elements are each decremented by 1, `d` is an integer equal to the length of `a` minus 1, `g` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the first element of `a` is 0, stdin contains `t-3` test cases, and `i` is 0. If an exception occurs, the loop is terminated.**
