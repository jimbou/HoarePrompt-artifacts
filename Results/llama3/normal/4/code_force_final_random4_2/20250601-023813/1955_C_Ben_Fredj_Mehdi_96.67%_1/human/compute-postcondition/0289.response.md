Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `z` is 2, `n` is an integer equal to the first integer in the first line of the first test case, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of the first test case and must be at least 2, `a` is a list of integers from the second line of the first test case where the first and last elements are each decremented by 2, `d` is an integer equal to the length of `a` minus 2, `g` is either -1 or 0 depending on whether the first element of `a` is 0, stdin contains `t-3` test cases, and `i` is 1. If the first element of `a` is 0, then the state of the program remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `d` has been decremented by 1, resulting in `d` being equal to the length of `a` minus 2. All other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions regarding the first element of `a` and the state of the program still apply.
