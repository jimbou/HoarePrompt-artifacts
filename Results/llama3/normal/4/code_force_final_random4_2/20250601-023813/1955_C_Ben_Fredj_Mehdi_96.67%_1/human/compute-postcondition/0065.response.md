Output: **t is an integer greater than 0, z is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer and equals 5999999999, a is a list of integers, stdin contains t-1 test cases. The current value of k is 5999999999. Additionally, either n is not equal to 1, or the first element of a is not equal to 1. Furthermore, either n is not equal to 101, or the first element of a is not equal to 1. Also, it is not the case that n is equal to 2, and a is equal to [1000000000, 1000000000]. Moreover, it is not the case that n is equal to 5. Either n is not equal to 20 or the first element of a is not equal to 1, and '5' is printed**
