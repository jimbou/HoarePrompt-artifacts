Based on the precondition, the code will print the string '200'.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. The precondition states that k is an integer equal to 200000000000.
2. The print statement simply prints the string '200', without referencing any variables or objects.

Therefore, the output will be the string '200', regardless of the values of the other variables and objects mentioned in the precondition.

Output: **200**
