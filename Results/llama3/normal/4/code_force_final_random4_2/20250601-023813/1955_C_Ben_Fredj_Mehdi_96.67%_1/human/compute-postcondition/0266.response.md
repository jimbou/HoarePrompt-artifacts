Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet.

Initial State:

* `t` is an integer greater than 2.
* `z` is 2.
* `n` is an integer equal to the first integer in the first line of the first test case.
* `k` is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of the first test case.
* `a` is a list of integers from the second line of the first test case.
* `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases.

Code Snippet:
```
print('8')
```
The code snippet simply prints the string '8'.

Since the print statement does not depend on any variables or objects, the output will be the same regardless of the values of `t`, `z`, `n`, `k`, `a`, or the contents of `stdin`.

Output: **8**
