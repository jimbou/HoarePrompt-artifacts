Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 0, z is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If n is equal to 20 and k is equal to 10000000000, then the number 10 is printed. Otherwise, if k is equal to 5999999999, then '5' is printed. If k is equal to 4294967295, then the number 8 is being printed. If n is equal to 2, k is equal to a[0] - 1, and k is equal to a[1] - 2, then 0 is printed. If k is equal to 3000000000, then 2 is printed. If k is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in a, the length of the list a which is equal to n is printed. Otherwise, the loop terminates when `i` equals `k // 2`. `a[g]` and `a[d]` are decremented by `k // 2` unless they are 0, in which case they are decremented by `k // 2` plus the number of times they were 0. `g` is incremented by the number of times `a[g]` is 0, and `d` is decremented by the number of times `a[d]` is 0. If `k` is odd, `a[g]` is additionally decremented by 1, and the number of zeros in the list `a` is printed.***
