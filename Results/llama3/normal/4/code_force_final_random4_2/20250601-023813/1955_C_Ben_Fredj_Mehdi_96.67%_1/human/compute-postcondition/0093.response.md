Let's break down the code and analyze the possible exceptions that could occur.

The `try` block attempts to decrement the first and last elements of the list `a` by 1. It also updates the values of `g` and `d` based on the new values of the first and last elements of `a`.

The `except` block catches any exception that occurs during the execution of the `try` block and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.

Now, let's think about the possible exceptions that could occur:

* `IndexError`: If `g` or `d` is out of range, an `IndexError` will be raised. This could happen if `g` is greater than or equal to the length of `a` or if `d` is less than 0.
* `ValueError`: If the first or last element of `a` is not an integer, a `ValueError` will be raised when trying to decrement it by 1.
* `TypeError`: If `a` is not a list or if `g` or `d` is not an integer, a `TypeError` will be raised.

If an exception occurs, the program will break out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside, and the state of the program will remain unknown.

If no exception occurs, the program will update the values of `g` and `d` based on the new values of the first and last elements of `a`. The first and last elements of `a` will be decremented by 1, and if the first element becomes 0, `g` will be incremented by 1. If the last element becomes 0, `d` will be decremented by 1.

Therefore, the output state of the program after executing the `try`-`except` block is:

Output State: **The program either breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside with an unknown state, or it updates the values of `g` and `d` based on the new values of the first and last elements of `a`, which are decremented by 1. If the first element becomes 0, `g` is incremented by 1, and if the last element becomes 0, `d` is decremented by 1.**
