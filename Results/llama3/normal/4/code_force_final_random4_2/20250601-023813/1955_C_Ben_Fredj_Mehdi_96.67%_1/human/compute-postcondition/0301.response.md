Output State: **t is an integer greater than 2, z is 2, n is an integer equal to the first integer in the first line of the first test case, k is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of the first test case and must be at least 2, a is a list of integers from the second line of the first test case where the first and last elements are each decremented by k // 2, d is an integer equal to the length of a minus 1 if the last element of a is not 0, otherwise d is an integer equal to the length of a minus the number of times the last element of a was decremented to 0, g is either 0 or greater than 0 depending on whether the first element of a is 0 or not, i is k // 2 - 1, and stdin contains t-3 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop will execute k // 2 times. In each iteration, the first and last elements of the list a will be decremented by 1. If the first element of a becomes 0, the variable g will be incremented by 1. If the last element of a becomes 0, the variable d will be decremented by 1. After the loop finishes executing, the variables t, z, n, and stdin will remain unchanged. The variable k will be the same as the second integer in the first line of the first test case and must be at least 2. The variable i will be k // 2 - 1.
