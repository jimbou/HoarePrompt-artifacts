Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 0, z is 0, n is an integer, k is at least 2, a is a list of integers with the first and last elements decremented by 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases, d is the length of a minus 1, if the first element of a is 0, then g is 1, otherwise g is 0, i is 0***
