Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 2, `a` is a list of integers with the first and last elements decremented by 1, stdin contains `t-1` test cases, `d` is the length of `a` minus 1, `g` is 1, `i` is 0. The current value of the first element of `a` is 0**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `g` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` still has its first and last elements decremented by 1, and the first element of `a` is still 0. The number of test cases in stdin is still `t-1`. The length of `a` minus 1 is still stored in `d`. The values of `t`, `z`, `n`, `k`, and `i` are unchanged.
