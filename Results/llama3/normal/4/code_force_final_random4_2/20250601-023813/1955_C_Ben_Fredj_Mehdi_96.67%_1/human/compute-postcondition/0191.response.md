Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, z is 1, n is an integer equal to the first integer in the first line of the first test case, k is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of the first test case and is at least 3, a is a list of integers from the second line of the first test case where the first and last elements are each decremented by 2, d is an integer equal to the length of a minus 1, g is 1 if the first element of a is 0, otherwise g is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, i is 1**

In this output state, the value of g has been incremented by 1. If the first element of a was 0, then g was initially 1 and is now 2. If the first element of a was not 0, then g was initially 0 and is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
