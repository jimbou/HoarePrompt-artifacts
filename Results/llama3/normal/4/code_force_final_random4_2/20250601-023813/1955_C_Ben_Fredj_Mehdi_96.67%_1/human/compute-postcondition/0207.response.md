Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `z` is 1, `n` is an integer equal to the first integer in the first line of the first test case, `k` is an odd integer equal to the second integer in the first line of the first test case, `a` is a list of integers from the second line of the first test case where the first and last elements are each decremented by `k // 2` if no exception occurs and the element at index `g` is decremented by 1, `d` is an integer equal to the length of `a` minus (`k // 2` + 1) if the last element of `a` is 0, otherwise `d` is an integer equal to the length of `a` minus (`k // 2`), `g` is `k // 2` if the first element of `a` is 0 and all elements at indices `g` in `a` are 0, otherwise `g` is `k // 2` - 1, `i` is `k // 2` - 1, stdin contains `t-3` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `a[g]` has been decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `g` is still dependent on the first element of `a` and the elements at indices `g` in `a`. The value of `d` is still dependent on the last element of `a`. The stdin still contains `t-3` test cases.
