Output: **t is an integer greater than 0, z is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer equal to 4294967295, a is a list of integers, stdin contains t-1 test cases. The current value of k is equal to 4294967295. Additionally, either n is not equal to 1, or the first element of a is not equal to 1. Furthermore, either n is not equal to 101, or the first element of a is not equal to 1. Also, it is not the case that n is equal to 2 and a is equal to [1000000000, 1000000000]. Moreover, it is not the case that n is equal to 5. Either n is not equal to 20 or the first element of a is not equal to 1, and the number 8 is being printed**
