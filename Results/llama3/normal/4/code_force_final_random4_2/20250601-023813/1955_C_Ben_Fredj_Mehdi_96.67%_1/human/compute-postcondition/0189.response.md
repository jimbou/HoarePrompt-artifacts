The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and k, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k // 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `k` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `k` must be at least 3.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `z` is 1, `n` is an integer equal to the first integer in the first line of the first test case, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of the first test case and is at least 3, `a` is a list of integers from the second line of the first test case where the first and last elements are each decremented by 1, `d` is an integer equal to the length of `a` minus 1, `g` is 1 if the first element of `a` is 0, otherwise `g` is 0, stdin contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is 1**
