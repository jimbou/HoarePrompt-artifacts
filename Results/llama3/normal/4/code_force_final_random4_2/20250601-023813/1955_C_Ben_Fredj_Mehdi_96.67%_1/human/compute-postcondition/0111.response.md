Postcondition: **The loop terminates when `i` equals `k // 2`, `a[g]` and `a[d]` are decremented by `k // 2` unless they are 0, in which case they are decremented by `k // 2` plus the number of times they were 0, `g` is incremented by the number of times `a[g]` is 0, and `d` is decremented by the number of times `a[d]` is 0. Additionally, the current value of `k` is an odd number, as `k % 2` equals 1.**
