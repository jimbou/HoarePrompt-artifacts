Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, z is 1, n is an integer equal to the first integer in the first line of the first test case, k is an integer at least 4, a is a list of integers from the second line of the first test case where the first and last elements are each decremented by 3 if no exception occurs, d is an integer equal to the length of a minus 2 if the last element of a is 0, otherwise d is an integer equal to the length of a minus 1, g is 3 if the first element of a is 0, otherwise g is 2, stdin contains t-3 test cases, i is 2**

In this output state, the value of g has been incremented by 1. If the first element of a is 0, then g is now 3; otherwise, g is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
