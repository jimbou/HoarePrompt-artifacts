The code prints the number of occurrences of the value 0 in the list `a`. The list `a` is a list of integers from the second line of the first test case, where the first and last elements are each decremented by `k // 2` if `k` is even, otherwise by `(k - 1) // 2`. The value of `k` is an integer at least 2.

Output: **the number of times 0 appears in the list a (where a is the list of integers from the second line of the first test case with the first and last elements decremented by k // 2 if k is even, otherwise by (k - 1) // 2)**
