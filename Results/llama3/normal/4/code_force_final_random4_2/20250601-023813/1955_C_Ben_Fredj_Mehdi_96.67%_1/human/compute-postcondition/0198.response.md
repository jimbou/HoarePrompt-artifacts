Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, z is 1, n is an integer equal to the first integer in the first line of the first test case, k is an integer at least 4, a is a list of integers from the second line of the first test case where the first and last elements are each decremented by 3 if no exception occurs, d is an integer equal to the length of a minus 2 if the last element of a is 0, otherwise d is an integer equal to the length of a minus 1, g is 2 if the first element of a is 0, otherwise g is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, i is 2**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `z`, `n`, `k`, `i`, and the contents of `stdin` remain unchanged. The list `a` has its elements at indices `g` and `d` decremented by 1. The value of `g` depends on the first element of `a`, and the value of `d` depends on the last element of `a`.
