Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `z` is 1, `n` is an integer equal to the first integer in the first line of the first test case, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of the first test case and is at least 2, `a` is a list of integers from the second line of the first test case where the first and last elements are each decremented by 1, `d` is an integer equal to the length of `a` minus 2, `g` is 1 if the first element of `a` is 0, otherwise `g` is 0, stdin contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is 0, and the current value of `a[d]` is not specified.**

In this output state, the value of `d` has been decremented by 1, so it is now equal to the length of `a` minus 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that the value of `a[d]` is no longer specified, as the value of `d` has changed.
