Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `z` is 2, `n` is an integer equal to the first integer in the first line of the first test case, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of the first test case and must be at least 2, `a` is a list of integers from the second line of the first test case where the first and last elements are each decremented by 2, `d` is an integer equal to the length of `a` minus 1, `g` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the first element of `a` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, and `i` is 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `g` has been incremented by 1, so it is now either 0 or 1, depending on whether the first element of `a` is 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
