Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, z is 1, n is an integer equal to the first integer in the first line of the first test case, k is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of the first test case, a is a list of integers from the second line of the first test case, stdin contains t-3 test cases.**

Explanation: The first line reads the first line of the first test case from stdin and assigns it to `a`. The second line extracts the first integer from `a` and assigns it to `n`. The third line extracts the second integer from `a` and assigns it to `k`. The fourth line reads the second line of the first test case from stdin, splits it into integers, and assigns the list to `a`. The value of `t` and `z` remains unchanged. The stdin now contains `t-3` test cases.
