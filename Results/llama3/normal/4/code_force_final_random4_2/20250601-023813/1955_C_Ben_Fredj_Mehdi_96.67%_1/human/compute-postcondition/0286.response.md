Output State: **t is an integer greater than 2, z is 2, n is an integer equal to the first integer in the first line of the first test case, k is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of the first test case and must be at least 2, a is a list of integers from the second line of the first test case where the first and last elements are each decremented by 2, d is an integer equal to the length of a minus 1, g is either -1 or 0 depending on whether the first element of a is 0, stdin contains t-3 test cases, and i is 1**

In this final state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as an integer greater than 2. The value of `z` also remains the same, which is 2. The values of `n` and `k` are still equal to the first and second integers in the first line of the first test case, respectively, with `k` being at least 2. The list `a` has been modified such that both the first and last elements have been decremented by 2. The value of `d` remains the same, which is the length of `a` minus 1. The value of `g` has been updated to either -1 or 0, depending on whether the first element of `a` is 0 after the decrement operation. The number of test cases in stdin remains `t-3`. Lastly, the value of `i` is still 1.
