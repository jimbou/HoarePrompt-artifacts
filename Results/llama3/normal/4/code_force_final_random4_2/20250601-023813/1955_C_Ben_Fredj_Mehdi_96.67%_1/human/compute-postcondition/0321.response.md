Postcondition: **t is an integer greater than 2, z is 2, n is an integer equal to the first integer in the first line of the first test case, k is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of the first test case, a is a list of integers from the second line of the first test case, stdin contains t-3 test cases. If n is 101 and k is 100000000000, the number 1 is printed. Otherwise, if k is equal to 10000000000000, the number 10000 is printed. If k is equal to 99999999999999, the number 99999 is printed. If k is equal to 199999999999999, the number 199999 is printed. If k is equal to 1000000000000, '1000' is printed. If k is equal to 200000000000, '200' is printed. If k is equal to 2147483648 and n is equal to 2, the number 2 is printed. If n is 2, k is 1000000000, and a is [1000000000, 1000000000], the number 0 is printed. If n is 5 and k is 2147483648, the number 2 is printed. If n is 20 and k is 10000000000, the number 10 is printed. If k is 5999999999, the number 5 is printed. If k is 4294967295, the number 8 is printed. If n is 2 and k is equal to a[0] - 1 and k is equal to a[1] - 2, then the number 0 is printed. If k is 3000000000, the number 2 is printed. If k is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in a, the length of the list a is printed. Otherwise, the first and last elements of a are decremented by k // 2 if k is even, otherwise by (k - 1) // 2, and the number of times 0 appears in the list a is printed.**
