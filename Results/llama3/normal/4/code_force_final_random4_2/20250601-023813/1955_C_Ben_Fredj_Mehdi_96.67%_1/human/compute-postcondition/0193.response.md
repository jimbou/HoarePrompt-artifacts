Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, z is 1, n is an integer equal to the first integer in the first line of the first test case, k is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of the first test case and is at least 3, a is a list of integers from the second line of the first test case where the first and last elements are each decremented by 2, d is an integer equal to the length of a minus 2, if the first element of a is 0, then g is 1, otherwise g is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, i is 1**

The value of d is decremented by 1. The initial value of d was the length of a minus 1. So, the new value of d is the length of a minus 2. The values of the other variables are not affected.
