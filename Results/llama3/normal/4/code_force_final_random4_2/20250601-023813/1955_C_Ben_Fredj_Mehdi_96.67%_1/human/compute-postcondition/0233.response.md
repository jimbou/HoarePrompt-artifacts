Output State: **t is an integer greater than 2, z is 2, n is an integer equal to the first integer in the first line of the first test case, k is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of the first test case, a is a list of integers from the second line of the first test case, stdin contains t-3 test cases.**

The code block reads the first line of the first test case from stdin, extracts the first and second integers, and assigns them to n and k, respectively. It then reads the second line of the first test case, splits it into integers, and assigns the list to a. The values of t and z remain unchanged. The remaining test cases in stdin are not affected.
