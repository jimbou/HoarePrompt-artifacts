Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 0, z is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, stdin contains t-1 test cases, d is the length of a minus 1, g is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k // 2):
    try:
        a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1
        a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1
        if a[g] == 0:
            g += 1
        if a[d] == 0:
            d -= 1
    except:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The program either breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside with an unknown state, or it updates the values of `g` and `d` based on the new values of the first and last elements of `a`, which are decremented by 1. If the first element becomes 0, `g` is incremented by 1, and if the last element becomes 0, `d` is decremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `g` and `d` are updated based on the new values of the first and last elements of `a`, `i` is 1, `k` must be greater than 2, `a[g]` is one less than its original value, and `a[d]` is one less than its original value unless it was 0, in which case it is two less than its original value. If an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `g` and `d` are updated based on the new values of the first and last elements of `a`, `i` is 2, `k` must be greater than 2, `a[g]` is two less than its original value, and `a[d]` is two less than its original value unless it was 0, in which case it is three less than its original value. If `a[g]` is 0, `g` is increased by 1, otherwise, no change is made to `g`. If `a[d]` is 0, `d` is decreased by 1, otherwise, no change is made to `d`. If an exception occurs, the loop is terminated.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
