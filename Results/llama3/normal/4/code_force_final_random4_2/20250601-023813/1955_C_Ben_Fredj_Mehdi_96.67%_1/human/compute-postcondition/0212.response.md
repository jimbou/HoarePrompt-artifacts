Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 1, z is 1, n is an integer equal to the first integer in the first line of the first test case, k is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of the first test case, a is a list of integers from the second line of the first test case, stdin contains t-3 test cases. If k is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in list a, the length of the list a which is equal to n is printed. Otherwise, the first and last elements of list a are each decremented by k // 2 if no exception occurs, and the number of occurrences of 0 in list a is printed after the element at index k // 2 - 1 is decremented by 1 if k is odd.***
