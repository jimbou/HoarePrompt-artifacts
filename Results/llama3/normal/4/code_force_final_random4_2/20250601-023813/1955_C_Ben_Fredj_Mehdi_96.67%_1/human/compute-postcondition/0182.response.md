Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, z is 1, n is an integer equal to the first integer in the first line of the first test case, k is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of the first test case and is at least 2, a is a list of integers from the second line of the first test case where the first and last elements are each decremented by 1, d is an integer equal to the length of a minus 1, g is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, i is 0, and the current value of a at index g is the second element of a which is equal to the second element of the list of integers from the second line of the first test case decremented by 1.**

In this output state, the value of g has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The current value of a at index g is the second element of a, which is equal to the second element of the list of integers from the second line of the first test case decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
