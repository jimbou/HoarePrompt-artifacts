Output State: **We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this case, since the initial state is unknown, we can't provide any specific information about the variables. However, we can say that the `break` statement will exit the innermost loop or if statement that it is directly inside of. The values of any variables are not affected by the `break` statement, so they remain unknown.
