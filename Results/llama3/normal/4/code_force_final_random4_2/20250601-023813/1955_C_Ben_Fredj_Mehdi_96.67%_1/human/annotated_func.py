The first line contains two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= k <= 10^15). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).

    #State: t is an integer greater than or equal to 0, z is equal to t, n is an integer equal to the first integer in the first line of the last test case, k is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of the last test case, a is a list of integers from the second line of the last test case, stdin contains 0 test cases. If k is 1999999998, the value 0 is printed. Otherwise, if k is 1999999999, the number 1 is printed. If k is 99999999999, the number 99 is printed. If n is 1, k is 10000000000000, and the first element of a is 1, the number 1 is printed. If k is 9999999999, the number 9 is printed. If n is 101 and k is 100000000000, 1 is printed. If k is 10000000000000, '10000' is printed. If k is 99999999999999, the number 99999 is printed. If k is 199999999999999, the number 199999 is printed. If k is 1000000000000, '1000' is printed. If k is 200000000000, the number 200 is printed. If k is 2147483648 and n is 2, the number 2 is printed. If n is 2, k is 1000000000, and a is [1000000000, 1000000000], then the number 0 is printed. If n is 5 and k is 2147483648, the number 2 is printed. If n is 20 and k is 10000000000, the number 10 is printed. If k is 5999999999, the number 5 is printed. If k is 4294967295, the number 8 is printed. If n is 2, k is a[0] - 1, and k is a[1] - 2, then the number 0 is printed. If k is 3000000000, the number 2 is printed. If k is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in list a, the length of the list a which is equal to n is printed. If k is less than the sum of the elements in list a, the first and last elements of list a are each decremented by k // 2 if no exception occurs, and the number of occurrences of 0 in list a is printed after the element at index k // 2 - 1 is decremented by 1 if k is odd.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two lines of input: the first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains n integers. The function then performs the following actions based on the value of k: if k is 1999999998, it prints 0; if k is 1999999999, it prints 1; if k is 99999999999, it prints 99; if n is 1, k is 10000000000000, and the first element of the list is 1, it prints 1; if k is 9999999999, it prints 9; if n is 101 and k is 100000000000, it prints 1; if k is 10000000000000, it prints 10000; if k is 99999999999999, it prints 99999; if k is 199999999999999, it prints 199999; if k is 1000000000000, it prints 1000; if k is 200000000000, it prints 200; if k is 2147483648 and n is 2, it prints 2; if n is 2, k is 1000000000, and the list is [1000000000, 1000000000], it prints 0; if n is 5 and k is 2147483648, it prints 2; if n is 20 and k is 10000000000, it prints 10; if k is 5999999999, it prints 5; if k is 4294967295, it prints 8; if n is 2, k is the first element of the list minus 1, and k is the second element of the list minus 2, it prints 0; if k is 3000000000, it prints 2; if k is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in the list, it prints the length of the list; otherwise, it decrements the first and last elements of the list by k // 2, and if k is odd, it decrements the element at index k // 2 - 1 by 1, then prints the number of occurrences of 0 in the list.
