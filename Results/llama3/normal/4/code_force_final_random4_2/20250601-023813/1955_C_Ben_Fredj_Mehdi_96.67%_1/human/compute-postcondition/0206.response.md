Postcondition: **t is an integer greater than 1, z is 1, n is an integer equal to the first integer in the first line of the first test case, k is an odd integer equal to the second integer in the first line of the first test case, a is a list of integers from the second line of the first test case where the first and last elements are each decremented by k // 2 if no exception occurs, d is an integer equal to the length of a minus (k // 2 + 1) if the last element of a is 0, otherwise d is an integer equal to the length of a minus (k // 2), g is k // 2 if the first element of a is 0 and all elements at indices g in a are 0, otherwise g is k // 2 - 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, i is k // 2 - 1.**
