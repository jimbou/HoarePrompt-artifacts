The only variables in the loop head are variables  z and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `z` and `t`. If `z` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `z` is 0, `t` is an integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `z` must be increased by 1 and `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **t is an integer greater than 1, z is 1, n is an integer, a is a list of integers, stdin contains t-2 test cases.**
