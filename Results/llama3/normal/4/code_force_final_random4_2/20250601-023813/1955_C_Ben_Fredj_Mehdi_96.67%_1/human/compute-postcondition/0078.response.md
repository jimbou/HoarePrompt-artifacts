Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 0, z is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, stdin contains t-1 test cases, k is not equal to 1999999998, k is not equal to 1999999999, k is not equal to 99999999999, k is not equal to 9999999999, k is not equal to 99999999999999. Additionally, either n is not equal to 1, or k is not equal to 10000000000000, or the first element of a is not equal to 1. Furthermore, either n is not equal to 101, or k is not equal to 100000000000. k is not equal to 10000000000000. k is not equal to 199999999999999. k is not equal to 1000000000000. k is not equal to 200000000000. Additionally, either k is not equal to 2147483648 or n is not equal to 2. Also, it is not the case that n is equal to 2, k is equal to 1000000000, and a is equal to [1000000000, 1000000000]. Moreover, it is not the case that n is equal to 5 and k is equal to 2147483648. Either n is not equal to 20 or k is not equal to 10000000000. k is not equal to 5999999999. k is not equal to 4294967295. Also, it is not the case that n is equal to 2, k is equal to a[0] - 1, and k is equal to a[1] - 2. Additionally, k is not equal to 3000000000.***
