You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for understanding the program state at the start of the for loop. You will be provided with the program state after the previous iteration, which you need to modify. You will also see the for loop statement. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 10, `i` is 3, `n` must be  greater than 3.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.


Example Answer:
The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 4 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 4.
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 4, `n` must be  greater than 4**

Example 2:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 0, students_list is a list of students that must have at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list, index is 1 
```
for index, student in enumerate(students_list):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.


Example Answer:
The only objects in the loop head are variables  index, students  and list  students_list, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the student_list.  If the list has at least 3 students the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, students_list has at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list, index is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 students and the index is 2 and student is the trird student in the list.
State: **`total` is 0, students_list is a list of students that must have at least 3 students, student is the third student in the list, index is 3**


Your Task:
State at the end of the previous iteration: *t is an integer greater than 0, z is 0, n is an integer, a is a list of integers, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If k equals 1999999998, the value 0 is printed. Otherwise, if k equals 1999999999, the number 1 is printed. If k equals 99999999999, '99' is printed. If n is 1, k is 10000000000000, and the first element of a is 1, then the number 1 is printed. If k equals 9999999999, '9' is printed. If n equals 101 and k equals 100000000000, the number 1 is printed. If k equals 10000000000000, either n is not equal to 1 or the first element of a is not equal to 1, and either n is not equal to 101, then the number 10000 is printed. If k equals 99999999999999, the number 99999 is printed. If k equals 199999999999999, the number 199999 is printed. If k equals 1000000000000, '1000' is printed. If k equals 200000000000, the number 200 is printed. If k equals 2147483648 and n equals 2, '2' is printed. If n equals 2, k equals 1000000000, and a equals [1000000000, 1000000000], 0 is printed. If n equals 5 and k equals 2147483648, the number 2 is printed. If n equals 20 and k equals 10000000000, the number 10 is printed. If k equals 5999999999, '5' is printed. If k equals 4294967295, the number 8 is printed. If n equals 2, k equals a[0] - 1, and k equals a[1] - 2, 0 is printed. If k equals 3000000000, 2 is printed. If k is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in a, the length of the list a which is equal to n is printed. Otherwise, the loop terminates when `i` equals `k // 2`. `a[g]` and `a[d]` are decremented by `k // 2` unless they are 0, in which case they are decremented by `k // 2` plus the number of times they were 0. `g` is incremented by the number of times `a[g]` is 0, and `d` is decremented by the number of times `a[d]` is 0. If `k` is odd, `a[g]` is additionally decremented by 1, and the number of zeros in the list `a` is printed.
```
for z in range(t):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.
