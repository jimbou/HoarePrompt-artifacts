The code snippet reads input from stdin for each test case and assigns values to variables `n`, `k`, and `a`. The first line reads a string from stdin, which contains two space-separated integers. The second line extracts the first integer from the string and assigns it to `n`. The third line extracts the second integer from the string and assigns it to `k`. The fourth line reads another string from stdin, which contains a list of space-separated integers, and assigns it to `a` as a list of integers.

Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, z is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, stdin contains t-1 test cases**
