Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 2, z is 2, n is an integer equal to the first integer in the first line of the first test case, k is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of the first test case, a is a list of integers from the second line of the first test case, stdin contains t-3 test cases. If n is 2 and k is equal to a[0] - 1 and k is equal to a[1] - 2, then the number 0 is printed. Otherwise, if k is equal to 3000000000, the number 2 is printed. If k is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in a, the length of the list a is printed. Otherwise, the first and last elements of a are decremented by k // 2 if k is even, otherwise by (k - 1) // 2, and the number of times 0 appears in the list a is printed.***
