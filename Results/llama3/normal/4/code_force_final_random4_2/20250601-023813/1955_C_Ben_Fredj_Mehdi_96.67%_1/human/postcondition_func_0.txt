This function reads input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two lines of input: the first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains n integers. The function then performs the following actions based on the value of k: if k is 1999999998, it prints 0; if k is 1999999999, it prints 1; if k is 99999999999, it prints 99; if n is 1, k is 10000000000000, and the first element of the list is 1, it prints 1; if k is 9999999999, it prints 9; if n is 101 and k is 100000000000, it prints 1; if k is 10000000000000, it prints 10000; if k is 99999999999999, it prints 99999; if k is 199999999999999, it prints 199999; if k is 1000000000000, it prints 1000; if k is 200000000000, it prints 200; if k is 2147483648 and n is 2, it prints 2; if n is 2, k is 1000000000, and the list is [1000000000, 1000000000], it prints 0; if n is 5 and k is 2147483648, it prints 2; if n is 20 and k is 10000000000, it prints 10; if k is 5999999999, it prints 5; if k is 4294967295, it prints 8; if n is 2, k is the first element of the list minus 1, and k is the second element of the list minus 2, it prints 0; if k is 3000000000, it prints 2; if k is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in the list, it prints the length of the list; otherwise, it decrements the first and last elements of the list by k // 2, and if k is odd, it decrements the element at index k // 2 - 1 by 1, then prints the number of occurrences of 0 in the list.
