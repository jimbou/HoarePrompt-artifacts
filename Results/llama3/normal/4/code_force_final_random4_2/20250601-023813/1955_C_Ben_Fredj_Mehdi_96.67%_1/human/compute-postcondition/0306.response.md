Output: **t is an integer greater than 2, z is 2, n is an integer equal to the first integer in the first line of the first test case, k is an integer at least 2, a is a list of integers from the second line of the first test case where the first and last elements are each decremented by k // 2 if k is even, otherwise by (k - 1) // 2, d is an integer equal to the length of a minus 1 if the last element of a is not 0, otherwise d is an integer equal to the length of a minus the number of times the last element of a was decremented to 0, g is either 0 or greater than 0 depending on whether the first element of a is 0 or not, i is k // 2 - 1 if k is even, otherwise (k - 1) // 2 - 1, and the first element of a is decremented by 1 if g is 0 and k is odd, otherwise the element at index g in a is decremented by 1 if k is odd, and stdin contains t-3 test cases, and the number of times 0 appears in the list a is being printed**
