Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 1, z is 1, n is an integer equal to the first integer in the first line of the first test case, k is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of the first test case, a is a list of integers from the second line of the first test case, d is an integer equal to the length of a minus 1, g is 0, stdin contains t-3 test cases.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k // 2):
    try:
        a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1
        a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1
        if a[g] == 0:
            g += 1
        if a[d] == 0:
            d -= 1
    except:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer greater than 1, `z` is 1, `n` is an integer equal to the first integer in the first line of the first test case, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of the first test case and is at least 2, `a` is a list of integers from the second line of the first test case where the first and last elements are each decremented by 1, `d` is an integer equal to the length of `a` minus 1, `g` is 1 if the first element of `a` is 0, otherwise `g` is 0, stdin contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is 0. If the last element of `a` is 0, `d` is updated to be the length of `a` minus 2. Otherwise, no changes are made. If an exception occurs, the function breaks out of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer greater than 1, z is 1, n is an integer equal to the first integer in the first line of the first test case, k is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of the first test case and is at least 3, a is a list of integers from the second line of the first test case where the first and last elements are each decremented by 2 if no exception occurs, if the last element of a is 0, then d is an integer equal to the length of a minus 2, otherwise d is an integer equal to the length of a minus 1, if the first element of a is 0, then g is 2, otherwise g is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, i is 1, and the loop breaks if an exception occurs.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer greater than 1, z is 1, n is an integer equal to the first integer in the first line of the first test case, k is an integer at least 4, a is a list of integers from the second line of the first test case where the first and last elements are each decremented by 3 if no exception occurs, d is an integer equal to the length of a minus 2 if the last element of a is not 0, otherwise d is an integer equal to the length of a minus 3, g is 3 if the first element of a is 0 and the element at index g in a is 0, otherwise g is 2, stdin contains t-3 test cases, i is 2. If an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside, and the state remains unknown.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
