The only variable in the loop head is variable `z` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^4), stdin contains `t` test cases, so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and `z` is now 0. 
State: **`t` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, stdin contains `t` test cases**
