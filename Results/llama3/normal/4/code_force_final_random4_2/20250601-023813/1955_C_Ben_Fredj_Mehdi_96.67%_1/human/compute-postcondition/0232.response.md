The only variable in the loop head is variable z and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t and z. If z is less than t, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is an integer greater than 1, z is 1. For the loop to execute again, z must be increased by 1, so z is 2 and t must be greater than 2.
State: **t is an integer greater than 2, z is 2, n is an integer equal to the first integer in the first line of the first test case, k is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of the first test case, a is a list of integers from the second line of the first test case, stdin contains t-3 test cases.**
