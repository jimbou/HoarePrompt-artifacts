A general exception might be triggered at `a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1` or `a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1` if `a[g]` or `a[d]` is not a valid integer, or if `g` or `d` is out of range for the list `a`. If an exception occurs, the function breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, the function decrements the first and last elements of `a` by 1, and updates `g` and `d` accordingly.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `z` is 1, `n` is an integer equal to the first integer in the first line of the first test case, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of the first test case and is at least 2, `a` is a list of integers from the second line of the first test case where the first and last elements are each decremented by 1, `d` is an integer equal to the length of `a` minus 1, `g` is 1 if the first element of `a` is 0, otherwise `g` is 0, stdin contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is 0. If the last element of `a` is 0, `d` is updated to be the length of `a` minus 2. Otherwise, no changes are made. If an exception occurs, the function breaks out of the loop.**
