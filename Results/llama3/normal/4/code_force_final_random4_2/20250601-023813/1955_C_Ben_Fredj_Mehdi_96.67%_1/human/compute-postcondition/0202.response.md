Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 1, z is 1, n is an integer equal to the first integer in the first line of the first test case, k is an integer at least 4, a is a list of integers from the second line of the first test case where the first and last elements are each decremented by 3 if no exception occurs, d is an integer equal to the length of a minus 2 if the last element of a is not 0, otherwise d is an integer equal to the length of a minus 3, g is 3 if the first element of a is 0 and the element at index g in a is 0, otherwise g is 2, stdin contains t-3 test cases, i is 2. If the element at index d in a is 0, then the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
