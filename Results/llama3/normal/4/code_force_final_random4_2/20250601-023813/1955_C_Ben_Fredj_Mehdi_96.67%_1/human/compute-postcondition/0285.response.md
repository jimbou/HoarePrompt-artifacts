To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `k`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k // 2`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `k` is an integer at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is 1, and `k` must still be at least 2.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `z` is 2, `n` is an integer equal to the first integer in the first line of the first test case, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer in the first line of the first test case and must be at least 2, `a` is a list of integers from the second line of the first test case where the first and last elements are each decremented by 1, `d` is an integer equal to the length of `a` minus 1, `g` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the first element of `a` is 0, stdin contains `t-3` test cases, and `i` is 1**
