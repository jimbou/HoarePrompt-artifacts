Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `z` is 1, `n` is an integer equal to the first integer in the first line of the first test case, `k` is an integer at least 4, `a` is a list of integers from the second line of the first test case where the first and last elements are each decremented by 3 if no exception occurs, `d` is an integer equal to the length of `a` minus 3 if the last element of `a` is 0, otherwise `d` is an integer equal to the length of `a` minus 2, `g` is 3 if the first element of `a` is 0 and the element at index `g` in `a` is 0, otherwise `g` is 2, stdin contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `d` has been decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `d` is now either the length of `a` minus 3 if the last element of `a` is 0, or the length of `a` minus 2 otherwise.
