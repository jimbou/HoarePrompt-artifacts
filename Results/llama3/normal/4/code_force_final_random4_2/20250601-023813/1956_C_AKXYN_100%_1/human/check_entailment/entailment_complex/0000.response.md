Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of all numbers in an n x n matrix by performing a series of operations. The program correctly calculates the maximum sum by summing the first n cubes, which is the optimal solution. It then prints this sum along with the number of operations, which is 2n.

The program also correctly prints the operations to achieve this maximum sum. It prints n pairs of operations, where each pair consists of a Type 1 operation and a Type 2 operation. The Type 1 operation assigns the numbers from 1 to n to the i-th row, and the Type 2 operation assigns the numbers from 1 to n to the i-th column.

The program's logic is correct, and it produces the expected output for the given problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
