Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains a single integer n. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the first n cubes, prints this sum along with the value of n multiplied by 2, and then prints a series of numbers in a specific pattern. The function does not return any value but instead prints the results directly to the console.**
