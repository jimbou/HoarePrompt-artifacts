Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `mat` is a square matrix of size `n` x `n` with values ranging from 1 to `n`, `res` is the sum of the first `n` cubes, `stdin` contains no test cases, `_` is 1, the sum of the first `n` cubes which is `res` and the value of `n` left shifted by 1 (i.e., `n` multiplied by 2), and this is printed: '2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1), which means the number 2 followed by the value of `i` (which is 0) and the numbers from 1 to `n` are being printed**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the value of `i` has reached 0. The other variables remain unchanged, and the loop has printed the required output for each iteration.
