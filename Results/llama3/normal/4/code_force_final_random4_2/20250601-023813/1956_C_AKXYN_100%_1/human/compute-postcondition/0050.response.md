Based on the initial state, the code `print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))` will print the string '1' followed by the value of `i` (which is `n-2`), and then the numbers from 1 to `n`.

Since `n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is `n-2`, which means `i` is also an integer. The value of `i` is not explicitly given, but it can be described as `n-2`.

The `*range(1, n + 1)` part of the print statement will print the numbers from 1 to `n`. Since `n` is an integer greater than 1, this will print a sequence of integers starting from 1 and ending at `n`.

Therefore, the output will be a string that starts with '1', followed by the value of `i` (which is `n-2`), and then the numbers from 1 to `n`.

Output: **1 (n-2) 1 2 3 ... n**
