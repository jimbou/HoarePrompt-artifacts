To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `mat` is a square matrix of size n x n with values ranging from 1 to n, `res` is the sum of the first `n` cubes, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `_` is 0, and this is printed: the sum of the first `n` cubes which is `res` and the value of `n` shifted left by 1 bit which is `n << 1`**
