The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is an integer, mat is a square matrix of size n x n with values ranging from 1 to n, res is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, _ is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **`n` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, mat is a square matrix of size n x n with values ranging from 1 to n, res is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, _ is 0**
