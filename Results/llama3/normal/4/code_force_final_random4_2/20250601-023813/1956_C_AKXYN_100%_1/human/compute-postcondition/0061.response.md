The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 2 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `mat` is a square matrix of size `n` x `n` with values ranging from 1 to `n`, `res` is `2 * i + 1 + (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` which is 15, `stdin` contains no test cases, `_` is 2, the sum of the first `n` cubes which is `res` and the value of `n` left shifted by 1 (i.e., `n` multiplied by 2), and this is printed: '2 %d' % i, *range(1, `n` + 1), which means the number 2 followed by the value of `i` (which is 2) and the numbers from 1 to `n` are being printed**
