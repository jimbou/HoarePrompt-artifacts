To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than 0. Since `i` is initially `n`, we need to adjust `n` to be at least 1 for the loop to execute. 

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `mat` is a square matrix of size `n` x `n` with values ranging from 1 to `n`, `res` is the sum of the first `n` cubes, `stdin` contains no test cases, `_` is 1, and this is printed: the sum of the first `n` cubes which is `res` and the value of `n` left shifted by 1 (i.e., `n` multiplied by 2)**
