Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, i is n, mat is a square matrix of size n x n with values ranging from 1 to n, res is the sum of the first n cubes, stdin contains no test cases, _ is 2, the sum of the first n cubes which is res and the value of n left shifted by 1 (i.e., n multiplied by 2), and this is printed: '2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1), which means the number 2 followed by the value of i (which is n) and the numbers from 1 to n are being printed**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: The loop has finished executing, and the variable `i` has reached the value of `n`. The variable `res` now holds the sum of the first `n` cubes. The other variables remain unchanged. The output is the number 2 followed by the value of `i` (which is `n`) and the numbers from 1 to `n`.
