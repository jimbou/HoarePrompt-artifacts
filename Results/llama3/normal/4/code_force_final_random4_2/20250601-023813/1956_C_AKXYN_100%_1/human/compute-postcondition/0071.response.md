The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is decreased by 1 so `i` is `n - 1` and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 0.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `mat` is a square matrix of size `n` x `n` with values ranging from 1 to `n`, `res` is the sum of the first `n` cubes, `stdin` contains no test cases, `_` is 2, the sum of the first `n` cubes which is `res` and the value of `n` left shifted by 1 (i.e., `n` multiplied by 2), and this is printed: '1 %d' % `i`, *range(1, `n` + 1), which means the number 1 followed by the value of `i` (which is `n - 1`) and the numbers from 1 to `n` are being printed, and the sum of the first `n` cubes which is `res` and the value of `n` left shifted by 1 (i.e., `n` multiplied by 2) are being printed, and the number 2 followed by the value of `i` (which is `n - 1`) and the numbers from 1 to `n` are being printed**
