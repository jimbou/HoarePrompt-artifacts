Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `mat` is a square matrix of size n x n with values ranging from 1 to n, `res` is 7, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `_` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to 7, which is the result of the expression `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` where `i` is 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
