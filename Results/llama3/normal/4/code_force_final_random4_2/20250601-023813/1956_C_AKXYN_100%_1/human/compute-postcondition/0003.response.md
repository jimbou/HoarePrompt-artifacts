The code `res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` increments the value of `res` by the product of `(i + 1)` and `(2 * i + 1)`. Since `i` is 0, `(i + 1)` is 1 and `(2 * i + 1)` is 1. Therefore, `res` is incremented by 1.

The values of the other variables are not affected. `n` is still an integer greater than 0, `i` is still 0, `mat` is still a square matrix of size n x n with values ranging from 1 to n, and `_` is still 0. stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one test case.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `mat` is a square matrix of size n x n with values ranging from 1 to n, `res` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `_` is 0**
