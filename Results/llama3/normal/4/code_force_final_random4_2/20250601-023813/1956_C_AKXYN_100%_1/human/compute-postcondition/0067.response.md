The code prints the number 1 followed by the value of `i` (which is `n`), and the numbers from 1 to `n`. Since `n` is an integer greater than 0, the output will be a sequence of numbers starting from 1 and ending at `n`, with the value of `n` (which is equal to `i`) printed after the number 1.

Output: **1, n, 1, 2, 3, ..., n (where n is the value of n)**
