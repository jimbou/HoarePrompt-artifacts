The value of `res` is increased by `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`. Since `i` is 2, the value of `res` is increased by `(2 + 1) * (2 * 2 + 1) = 3 * 5 = 15`. Therefore, the new value of `res` is 7 + 15 = 22. The values of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `mat` is a square matrix of size n x n with values ranging from 1 to n, `res` is 22, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `_` is 0**
