Output State: **n is an integer, mat is a square matrix of size n x n with values ranging from 1 to n, res is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, _ is 0**

Here's a breakdown of the code's impact on the program:

1. `n = int(input())`: This line reads an integer from the standard input (stdin) and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since stdin contains multiple test cases, this line consumes one test case, leaving multiple test cases minus one test case in stdin. The value of `n` is now an integer.

2. `mat = [list(range(1, n + 1)) for i in range(n)]`: This line creates a square matrix `mat` of size `n x n` using a list comprehension. The matrix is filled with values ranging from 1 to `n`. The value of `mat` is now a square matrix of size `n x n` with values ranging from 1 to `n`.

3. `res = 0`: This line assigns the value 0 to the variable `res`. The value of `res` is now 0.

The variable `_` is not modified by the code, so its value remains 0.

In summary, the code reads an integer from stdin, creates a square matrix of size `n x n` with values ranging from 1 to `n`, and assigns 0 to the variable `res`. The final state includes the updated values of `n`, `mat`, and `res`, as well as the remaining test cases in stdin and the unchanged value of `_`.
