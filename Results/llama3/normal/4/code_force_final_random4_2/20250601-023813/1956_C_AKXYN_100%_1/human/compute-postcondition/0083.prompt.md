Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains one input: an integer n (1 <= n <= 500).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    mat = [list(range(1, n + 1)) for i in range(n)]
    res = 0
    for i in range(n):
        res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)
    print(res, n << 1)
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
        print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0, `mat` is a square matrix of size n x n with values ranging from 1 to n, `res` is the sum of the first `n` cubes, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `_` is 0, and this is printed: the sum of the first `n` cubes which is `res` and the value of `n` shifted left by 1 bit which is `n << 1`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `mat` is a square matrix of size `n` x `n` with values ranging from 1 to `n`, `res` is the sum of the first `n` cubes, `stdin` contains no test cases, `_` is 1, the sum of the first `n` cubes which is `res` and the value of `n` left shifted by 1 (i.e., `n` multiplied by 2), and this is printed: '2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1), which means the number 2 followed by the value of `i` (which is 0) and the numbers from 1 to `n` are being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `mat` is a square matrix of size `n` x `n` with values ranging from 1 to `n`, `res` is the sum of the first `n` cubes, `stdin` contains no test cases, `_` is 2, the sum of the first `n` cubes which is `res` and the value of `n` left shifted by 1 (i.e., `n` multiplied by 2) are printed, and the number 1 followed by the value of `i` (which is 0) and the numbers from 1 to `n` are being printed, and the number 2 followed by the value of `i` (which is 0) and the numbers from 1 to `n` are being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
