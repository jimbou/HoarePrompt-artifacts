According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is 1 and `n` is an integer greater than 0, which ensures that the loop will execute. So, `i` needs to be adjusted to 0, which is the starting value of the range function.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `mat` is a square matrix of size `n` x `n` with values ranging from 1 to `n`, `res` is 0, `stdin` contains no test cases, `_` is 2, the sum of the first `n` cubes which is `res` and the value of `n` left shifted by 1 (i.e., `n` multiplied by 2), and this is printed: '2 %d' % i, *range(1, `n` + 1), which means the number 2 followed by the value of `i` (which is 0) and the numbers from 1 to `n` are being printed**
