To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the current state.

The loop head is `for i in range(n, 0, -1):`. This means that the loop will iterate from `n` down to 1, decrementing `i` by 1 in each iteration.

Given the current state:

* `n` is an integer greater than 0
* `i` is `n - 1`
* `mat` is a square matrix of size `n` x `n` with values ranging from 1 to `n`
* `res` is the sum of the first `n` cubes
* `stdin` contains no test cases
* `_` is 2
* The sum of the first `n` cubes which is `res` and the value of `n` left shifted by 1 (i.e., `n` multiplied by 2) are printed
* '1 %d' % `i`, *range(1, `n` + 1) is printed, which means the number 1 followed by the value of `i` (which is `n - 1`) and the numbers from 1 to `n` are being printed
* The number 2 followed by the value of `i` (which is `n - 1`) and the numbers from 1 to `n` are being printed
* The number 1 followed by the value of `i` (which is `n - 1`) and the numbers from 1 to `n` are being printed
* The number 2 followed by the value of `i` (which is `n - 1`) and the numbers from 1 to `n` are being printed

To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the loop head and the current state. Since `i` is `n - 1`, the next iteration will decrement `i` by 1, making it `n - 2`. The value of `n` remains the same.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `mat` is a square matrix of size `n` x `n` with values ranging from 1 to `n`, `res` is the sum of the first `n` cubes, `stdin` contains no test cases, `_` is 2, the sum of the first `n` cubes which is `res` and the value of `n` left shifted by 1 (i.e., `n` multiplied by 2) are printed, '1 %d' % `i`, *range(1, `n` + 1) is printed, which means the number 1 followed by the value of `i` (which is `n - 2`) and the numbers from 1 to `n` are being printed, and the number 2 followed by the value of `i` (which is `n - 2`) and the numbers from 1 to `n` are being printed, and the number 1 followed by the value of `i` (which is `n - 2`) and the numbers from 1 to `n` are being printed, and the number 2 followed by the value of `i` (which is `n - 2`) and the numbers from 1 to `n` are being printed**
