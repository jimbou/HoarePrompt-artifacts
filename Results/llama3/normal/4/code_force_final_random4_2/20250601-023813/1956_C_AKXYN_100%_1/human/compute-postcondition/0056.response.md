Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, i is 1, mat is a square matrix of size n x n with values ranging from 1 to n, res is 0, stdin contains no test cases, _ is 2, the sum of the first n cubes which is res and the value of n left shifted by 1 (i.e., n multiplied by 2), and this is printed: '2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1), which means the number 2 followed by the value of i (which is 1) and the numbers from 1 to n are being printed**

Here's a breakdown of the changes:

*   The first line `n = int(input())` assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `stdin` contains no test cases, `n` will be an integer greater than 0.
*   The second line `mat = [list(range(1, n + 1)) for i in range(n)]` creates a square matrix `mat` of size `n` x `n` with values ranging from 1 to `n`.
*   The third line `res = 0` resets the value of `res` to 0.

The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still 1, and the sum of the first `n` cubes which is `res` and the value of `n` left shifted by 1 (i.e., `n` multiplied by 2) is still printed as '2 %d' % i, \*range(1, n + 1).
