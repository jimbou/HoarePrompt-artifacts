Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n-1`, `mat` is a square matrix of size n x n with values ranging from 1 to n, `res` is the sum of the first `n` cubes, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `_` is 0**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be one less than the initial value of `n`, and the variable `res` will hold the sum of the cubes of the first `n` positive integers. The other variables, `mat` and `_`, remain unchanged, and `n` is still an integer greater than or equal to 0.
