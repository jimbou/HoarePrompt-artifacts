The code prints a string containing the value of `i` (which is equal to `n`) and the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
Output: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `mat` is a square matrix of size `n` x `n` with values ranging from 1 to `n`, `res` is the sum of the first `n` cubes, `stdin` contains no test cases, `_` is 1, the sum of the first `n` cubes which is `res` and the value of `n` left shifted by 1 (i.e., `n` multiplied by 2), and this is printed: '1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1)**
