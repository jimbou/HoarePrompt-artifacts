The code prints the number 1 followed by the value of `i` (which is `n - 1`) and the numbers from 1 to `n`. Here, `n` is an integer greater than 0 and `i` is `n - 1`. So, the output will be a sequence of numbers starting with 1, followed by `n - 1`, and then the numbers from 1 to `n`.

Output: **1, n - 1, 1, 2, 3, ..., n**
