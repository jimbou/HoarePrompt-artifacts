The code prints the string '2' followed by the value of `i` (which is equal to `n`), and then the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive). Since `n` is an integer greater than 0, the output will be a sequence of numbers starting from 2 and `n`, followed by the numbers from 1 to `n`.

Output: **2 [n] 1 2 3 ... [n]**
