Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `mat` is a square matrix of size `n` x `n` with values ranging from 1 to `n`, `res` is 7 + (2 + 1) * (2 * 2 + 1), `stdin` contains no test cases, `_` is 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains the same, it is an integer greater than 0. The value of `i` is still 2. The matrix `mat` is still a square matrix of size `n` x `n` with values ranging from 1 to `n`. The value of `res` is updated to 7 + (2 + 1) * (2 * 2 + 1), which is 7 + 3 * 5 = 7 + 15 = 22. The stdin still contains no test cases. The value of `_` is still 1.
