Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `mat` is a square matrix of size `n` x `n` with values ranging from 1 to `n`, `res` is 1, `stdin` contains no test cases, `_` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to 1, which is the result of the expression `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` where `i` is 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
