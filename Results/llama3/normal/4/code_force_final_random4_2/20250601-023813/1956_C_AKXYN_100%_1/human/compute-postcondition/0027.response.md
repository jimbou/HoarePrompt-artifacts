Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0, `mat` is a square matrix of size n x n with values ranging from 1 to n, `res` is the sum of the first `n` cubes, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `_` is 0, and this is printed: the sum of the first `n` cubes which is `res` and the value of `n` shifted left by 1 bit which is `n << 1`**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is: the loop has finished executing, `i` has reached 0, and the initial state of the other variables remains unchanged. The loop has printed the sum of the first `n` cubes and the value of `n` shifted left by 1 bit for each iteration.
