The code prints the string '2' followed by a space, followed by the value of `i` which is `n-2`, followed by a space, and then the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) separated by spaces.

Since `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-2`, and `n` is a positive integer, the output will be a string that starts with '2', followed by the value of `i` (which is `n-2`), followed by a space, and then the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) separated by spaces.

Output: **2 (n-2) 1 2 3 ... n (where n is the value of n)**
