Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than 0, i is 1, mat is a square matrix of size n x n with values ranging from 1 to n, res is 0, stdin contains no test cases, _ is 2, the sum of the first n cubes which is res and the value of n left shifted by 1 (i.e., n multiplied by 2), and this is printed: '2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1), which means the number 2 followed by the value of i (which is 1) and the numbers from 1 to n are being printed
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `mat` is a square matrix of size `n` x `n` with values ranging from 1 to `n`, `res` is `2 * i + 1` which is 1, `stdin` contains no test cases, `_` is 2, the sum of the first `n` cubes which is `res` and the value of `n` left shifted by 1 (i.e., `n` multiplied by 2), and this is printed: '2 %d' % i, *range(1, `n` + 1), which means the number 2 followed by the value of `i` (which is 0) and the numbers from 1 to `n` are being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `mat` is a square matrix of size `n` x `n` with values ranging from 1 to `n`, `res` is `2 * i + 1 + (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` which is 9, `stdin` contains no test cases, `_` is 2, the sum of the first `n` cubes which is `res` and the value of `n` left shifted by 1 (i.e., `n` multiplied by 2), and this is printed: '2 %d' % i, *range(1, `n` + 1), which means the number 2 followed by the value of `i` (which is 1) and the numbers from 1 to `n` are being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `mat` is a square matrix of size `n` x `n` with values ranging from 1 to `n`, `res` is 2 * i + 1 + (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) + (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) which is 30, `stdin` contains no test cases, `_` is 2, the sum of the first `n` cubes which is `res` and the value of `n` left shifted by 1 (i.e., `n` multiplied by 2), and this is printed: '2 %d' % i, *range(1, `n` + 1), which means the number 2 followed by the value of `i` (which is 2) and the numbers from 1 to `n` are being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
