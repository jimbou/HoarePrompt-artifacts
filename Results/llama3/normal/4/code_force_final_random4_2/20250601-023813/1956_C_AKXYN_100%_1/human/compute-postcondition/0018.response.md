The `print` statement will print a string that starts with '1', followed by a space, followed by the value of `i` which is `n-1`, followed by a space, and then the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) separated by spaces.

Since `i` is `n-1` and `n` is greater than 0, the value of `i` will be a positive integer less than `n`. The `range(1, n + 1)` will generate numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

Output: **1 (space) (n-1) (space) 1 2 3 ... n (where n is the value of n and n-1 is the value of i)**
