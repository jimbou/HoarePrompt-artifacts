The code prints the number 2 followed by the value of `i` (which is `n - 1`) and the numbers from 1 to `n`. Since `i` is `n - 1` and `n` is an integer greater than 0, the value of `i` will be an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n`. The numbers from 1 to `n` will be a sequence of consecutive integers starting from 1 and ending at `n`.

Output: **2, (n - 1), 1, 2, 3, ..., n**
