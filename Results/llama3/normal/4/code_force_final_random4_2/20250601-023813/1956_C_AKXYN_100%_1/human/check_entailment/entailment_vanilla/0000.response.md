Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of all numbers in an n x n matrix by performing a series of operations. The operations involve assigning a permutation of integers from 1 to n to a row or column of the matrix.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases and then iterating over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix (n) and initializes a matrix with all elements set to 0.
3. It then calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix by summing up the products of each row number (i + 1) and the sum of the first 2i + 1 positive integers (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1). This is because the optimal solution involves assigning the largest possible numbers to each row and column.
4. The program then prints the maximum possible sum and the number of operations required to achieve it (which is 2n).
5. The program then generates the operations required to achieve the maximum sum. It does this by iterating over the rows of the matrix in reverse order and assigning the permutation of integers from 1 to n to each row and column.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the optimal solution for the given problem. The time complexity of the program is O(n^2), which is acceptable given the constraints of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
