The code prints a formatted string containing the value of `i` which is equal to `n`, and the values of the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) generated by the `range(1, n + 1)` function.

Since `i` is equal to `n`, the first part of the output will be `1` followed by the value of `n`.

The `*` operator in the `print` statement unpacks the `range` object into separate arguments, so the numbers from 1 to `n` will be printed as separate values.

Output: **1 [n], 1, 2, 3, ..., [n] (where [n] is the value of n)**
