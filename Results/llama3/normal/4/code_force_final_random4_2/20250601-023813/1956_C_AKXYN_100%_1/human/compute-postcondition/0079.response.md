The code prints a string '2' followed by the value of `i` (which is `n - 2`) and the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

Since `n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is `n - 2`, and the numbers from 1 to `n` are being printed, the output will be a string that starts with '2', followed by the value of `i` (which is `n - 2`), and then the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

Output: **2 (n - 2) 1 2 3 ... n (where n is an integer greater than 0)**
