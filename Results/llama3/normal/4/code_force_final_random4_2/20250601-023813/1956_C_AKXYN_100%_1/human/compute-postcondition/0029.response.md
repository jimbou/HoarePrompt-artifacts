Output State: **n is an integer, i is 0, mat is a square matrix of size n x n with values ranging from 1 to n, res is 0, stdin contains no test cases, _ is 1, the sum of the first n cubes which is res and the value of n shifted left by 1 bit which is n << 1**

The code block first assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since stdin contains no test cases, `n` becomes an integer. The second line creates a square matrix `mat` of size `n x n` with values ranging from 1 to `n`. The third line resets `res` to 0. The previous values of `i`, `_`, the sum of the first `n` cubes, and the value of `n` shifted left by 1 bit remain unchanged.
