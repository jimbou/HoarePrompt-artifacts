Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `mat` is a square matrix of size `n` x `n` with values ranging from 1 to `n`, `res` is the sum of the first `n` cubes, `stdin` contains no test cases, `_` is 2, the sum of the first `n` cubes which is `res` and the value of `n` left shifted by 1 (i.e., `n` multiplied by 2) are printed, and the number 1 followed by the value of `i` (which is 0) and the numbers from 1 to `n` are being printed, and the number 2 followed by the value of `i` (which is 0) and the numbers from 1 to `n` are being printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `i` has reached 0, and the loop has printed the numbers 1 and 2 followed by the value of `i` (which is 0) and the numbers from 1 to `n` for each iteration. The other variables, such as `n`, `mat`, `res`, `stdin`, and `_`, remain unchanged.
