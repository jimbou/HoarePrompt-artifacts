The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` must be decreased by 1 so `i` is `n-1` and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 0.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `mat` is a square matrix of size n x n with values ranging from 1 to n, `res` is the sum of the first `n` cubes, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `_` is 0, and this is printed: 2, followed by a space, followed by the value of `i` which is `n-1`, followed by a space, followed by the numbers from 1 to `n-1` (inclusive) separated by spaces**
