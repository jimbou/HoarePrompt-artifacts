Output State: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n-1`, `mat` is a square matrix of size n x n with values ranging from 1 to n, `res` is `n*(n+1)*(2n+1)/6`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `_` is 0

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: The loop has finished executing, and the value of `i` is now `n-1`. The value of `res` has been updated to the sum of the first `n` cubes, which is given by the formula `n*(n+1)*(2n+1)/6`. The other variables, `mat` and stdin, remain unchanged.
