Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0, `mat` is a square matrix of size `n` x `n` with values ranging from 1 to `n`, `res` is the sum of the first `n` cubes, `stdin` contains no test cases, `_` is equal to the number of test cases, the sum of the first `n` cubes which is `res` and the value of `n` left shifted by 1 (i.e., `n` multiplied by 2) are printed, and the number 1 followed by the value of `i` (which is 0) and the numbers from 1 to `n` are being printed, and the number 2 followed by the value of `i` (which is 0) and the numbers from 1 to `n` are being printed.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `n` will be the same as the initial value, `i` will be 0, `mat` will be a square matrix of size `n` x `n` with values ranging from 1 to `n`, `res` will be the sum of the first `n` cubes, `stdin` will contain no test cases, and `_` will be equal to the number of test cases. Additionally, the sum of the first `n` cubes and the value of `n` left shifted by 1 will be printed, and the number 1 followed by the value of `i` and the numbers from 1 to `n` will be printed, and the number 2 followed by the value of `i` and the numbers from 1 to `n` will be printed.
