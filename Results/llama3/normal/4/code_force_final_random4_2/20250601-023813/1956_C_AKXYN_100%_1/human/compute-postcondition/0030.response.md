The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is 0, which is the initial value for the loop variable, so it's already set correctly. `n` is an integer, but we need to ensure it's at least 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `mat` is a square matrix of size `n` x `n` with values ranging from 1 to `n`, `res` is 0, `stdin` contains no test cases, `_` is 1, the sum of the first `n` cubes which is `res` and the value of `n` shifted left by 1 bit which is `n << 1`**
