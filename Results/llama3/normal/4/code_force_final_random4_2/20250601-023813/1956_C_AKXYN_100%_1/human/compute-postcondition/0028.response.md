State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0, `mat` is a square matrix of size n x n with values ranging from 1 to n, `res` is the sum of the first `n` cubes, stdin contains no test cases, `_` is 1, and this is printed: the sum of the first `n` cubes which is `res` and the value of `n` shifted left by 1 bit which is `n << 1`**
