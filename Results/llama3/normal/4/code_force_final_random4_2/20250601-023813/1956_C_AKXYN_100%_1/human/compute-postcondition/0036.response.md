Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `mat` is a square matrix of size `n` x `n` with values ranging from 1 to `n`, `res` is the sum of the first `n` cubes, `stdin` contains no test cases, `_` is 1**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the values of `i` and `res`. The value of `i` is now equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has executed `n` times. The value of `res` is now equal to the sum of the first `n` cubes, which is the result of the loop's execution. The other variables, `mat`, `stdin`, and `_`, remain unchanged.
