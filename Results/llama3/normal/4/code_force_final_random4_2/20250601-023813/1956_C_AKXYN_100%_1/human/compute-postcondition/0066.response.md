To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than 0. Since `i` is initially `n`, we need to adjust the state of `n` to ensure it is greater than 0. Additionally, since the loop iterates from `n` to 1 in reverse order, we need to adjust the state of `i` to be `n` at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `mat` is a square matrix of size `n` x `n` with values ranging from 1 to `n`, `res` is the sum of the first `n` cubes, `stdin` contains no test cases, `_` is 2, the sum of the first `n` cubes which is `res` and the value of `n` left shifted by 1 (i.e., `n` multiplied by 2), and this is printed: '2 %d' % `i`, *range(1, `n` + 1), which means the number 2 followed by the value of `i` (which is `n`) and the numbers from 1 to `n` are being printed, and the sum of the first `n` cubes which is `res` and the value of `n` left shifted by 1 (i.e., `n` multiplied by 2) are being printed**
