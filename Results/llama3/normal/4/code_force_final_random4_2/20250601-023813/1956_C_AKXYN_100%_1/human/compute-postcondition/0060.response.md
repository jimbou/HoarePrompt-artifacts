Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `mat` is a square matrix of size `n` x `n` with values ranging from 1 to `n`, `res` is `2 * i + 1 + (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` which is 9, `stdin` contains no test cases, `_` is 2, the sum of the first `n` cubes which is `res` and the value of `n` left shifted by 1 (i.e., `n` multiplied by 2), and this is printed: '2 %d' % i, *range(1, `n` + 1), which means the number 2 followed by the value of `i` (which is 1) and the numbers from 1 to `n` are being printed**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to `2 * i + 1 + (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`, which is equal to 9. The other variables remain unchanged. The program has printed the number 2 followed by the value of `i` (which is 1) and the numbers from 1 to `n`.
