Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m`, `k` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is equal to `m` or `b[j]` is equal to `a[i]`, stdin contains t-1 test cases, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and `j` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `k` is 0 because `j` is not less than `m`. The stdin still contains t-1 test cases. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
