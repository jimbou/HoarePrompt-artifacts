Output State: **n is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, a is a binary string of length n, b is a binary string of length m, i is 2, j is less than m and is equal to m or b[j] is equal to a[i], k is 1 if j is equal to m, otherwise k is 3, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

The code increments `k` by 1 and `j` by 1. Since `k` was 0 if `j` was equal to `m`, otherwise `k` was 2, `k` becomes 1 if `j` is equal to `m`, otherwise `k` becomes 3. The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but its relationship with `m` and `b[j]` being equal to `a[i]` remains the same. No other variables are affected.
