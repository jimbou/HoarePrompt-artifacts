Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m`, `i` is 2, `j` is less than `m`, `k` is 2, stdin contains t-1 test cases, and b[j] is not equal to a[i].**

In this output state, the value of `j` has been incremented by 1, so it is now less than `m`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The condition `b[j] is not equal to a[i]` is still valid, as the increment of `j` does not affect the value of `a[i]`.
