The variables in the loop head are j, m, b, a, and i. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables j, m, b, a, and i. If j is less than m and b[j] is not equal to a[i], the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, j is less than m and is increased by 1, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, a is a binary string of length n, b is a binary string of length m, and i is 2. j being less than m does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to j is less than m-1. Also, b[j] must not be equal to a[i] for the loop to execute again. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m`, `i` is 2, `j` is less than `m-1`, `k` is 2, stdin contains t-1 test cases, and b[j] is not equal to a[i]**
