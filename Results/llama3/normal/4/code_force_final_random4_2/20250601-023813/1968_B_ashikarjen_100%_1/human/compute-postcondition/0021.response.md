Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m`, `k` is 1 if `j` is less than `m`, otherwise `k` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is equal to `m` or `b[j]` is equal to `a[i]`, stdin contains t-1 test cases**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `j` will be equal to `m` (meaning the loop has iterated over the entire string `b`) or `b[j]` will be equal to `a[i]` (meaning a match has been found between the strings `a` and `b`). The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged, and there are still `t-1` test cases left in the standard input.
