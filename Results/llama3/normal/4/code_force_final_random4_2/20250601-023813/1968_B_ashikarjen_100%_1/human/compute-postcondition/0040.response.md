Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, a is a binary string of length n, b is a binary string of length m, i is equal to n, j is equal to m, k is equal to the number of matches between a and b, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `stdin` as in the initial state. The variable `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has iterated `n` times. The variable `j` will be equal to `m`, indicating that the inner while loop has iterated `m` times. The variable `k` will be equal to the number of matches between the binary strings `a` and `b`.
