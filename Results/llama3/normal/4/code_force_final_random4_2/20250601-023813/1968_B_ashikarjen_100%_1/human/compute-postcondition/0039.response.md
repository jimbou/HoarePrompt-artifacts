Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, a is a binary string of length n, b is a binary string of length m, i is 2, j is equal to m or b[j] is equal to a[i]. If j is less than m, k is 1 if j is equal to m, otherwise k is 3. Otherwise, k is 0 if j is equal to m, otherwise k is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. stdin contains t-1 test cases.***
