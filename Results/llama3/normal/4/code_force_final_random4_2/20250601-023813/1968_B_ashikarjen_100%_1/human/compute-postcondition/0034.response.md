Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m`, `i` is 2, `j` is equal to `m` or `b[j]` is equal to `a[i]`, `k` is 0 if `j` is equal to `m`, otherwise `k` is 2, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `j` will either be equal to `m` (meaning the loop has iterated over the entire string `b`) or `b[j]` will be equal to `a[i]` (meaning a match has been found between the strings `a` and `b`). If `j` is equal to `m`, then `k` will be 0, indicating that the loop has finished iterating over `b`. Otherwise, `k` will be 2, indicating that a match has been found and the loop has terminated. The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop.
