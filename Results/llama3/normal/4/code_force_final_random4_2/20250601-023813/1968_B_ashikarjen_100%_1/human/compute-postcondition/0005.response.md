Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `m` is greater than 1, `a` is a binary string of length `n` with its first character being different from the first character of `b`, `b` is a binary string of length `m` and `b[1]` is not equal to `a[0]`, `k` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n must be greater than 0**

In this output state, the value of `j` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 is still valid.
