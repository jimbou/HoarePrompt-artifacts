Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m`, `k` is 1 if `j` is less than `m`, otherwise `k` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is less than `m` and `j` is increased by 2, `b[j-2]` is not equal to `a[i]`, stdin contains t-1 test cases**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `k`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `j` is increased by 1, so it is now less than `m` and has been increased by 2 in total. The condition `b[j-2]` is not equal to `a[i]` still holds true. The stdin still contains t-1 test cases.
