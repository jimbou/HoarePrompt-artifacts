Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a binary string of length `n` with its first character being different from the first character of `b`, `b` is a binary string of length `m`, `k` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n must be greater than 0**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `j` is incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The input state remains the same, with t-1 test cases remaining in the standard input. The condition that `n` must be greater than 0 is still valid.
