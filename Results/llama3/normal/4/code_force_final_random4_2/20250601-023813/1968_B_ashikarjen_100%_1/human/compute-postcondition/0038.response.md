Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m`, `i` is 2, `j` is equal to `m` or `b[j]` is equal to `a[i]`, `k` is 0 if `j` is equal to `m`, otherwise `k` is 2, stdin contains t-1 test cases and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, which means the execution of the program will continue from the next statement outside the loop or if statement. The stdin still contains t-1 test cases.
