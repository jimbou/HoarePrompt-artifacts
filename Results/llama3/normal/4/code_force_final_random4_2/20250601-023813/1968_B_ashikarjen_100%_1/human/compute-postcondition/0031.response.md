Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m`, `i` is 2, `j` is less than `m` and is increased by 1, `k` is 2, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `j` is increased by 1, but it is still less than `m`. The values of the other variables remain the same. The stdin still contains t-1 test cases.
