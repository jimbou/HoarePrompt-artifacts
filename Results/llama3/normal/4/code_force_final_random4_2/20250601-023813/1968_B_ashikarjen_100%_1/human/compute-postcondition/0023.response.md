Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, a is a binary string of length n, b is a binary string of length m, k is 2, i is 1, j is equal to m or b[j] is equal to a[i], stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been incremented by 1, making it 2. The value of `j` has also been incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and the contents of stdin remain unchanged.
