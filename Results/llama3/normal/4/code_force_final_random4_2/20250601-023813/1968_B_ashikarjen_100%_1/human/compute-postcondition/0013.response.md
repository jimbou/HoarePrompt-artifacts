Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m`, `k` is 1 if `j` is less than `m`, otherwise `k` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is equal to `m` or `b[j]` is equal to `a[i]`, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n must be greater than 0. If `j` is less than `m`, then `k` is set to 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
