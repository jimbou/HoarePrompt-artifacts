Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m`, `i` is 2, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `k` is 2 if `j` is less than `m`, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `j` has been incremented by 1, so it is now less than or equal to `m`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-1 test cases.
