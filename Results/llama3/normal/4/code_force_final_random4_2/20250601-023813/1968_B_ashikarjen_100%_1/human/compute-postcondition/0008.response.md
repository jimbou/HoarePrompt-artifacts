Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m`, `k` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is equal to `m` or `b[j]` is equal to `a[i]`, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n must be greater than 0**

This output state means that after the loop has finished executing, the value of `j` will either be equal to `m` (meaning the loop has iterated over the entire string `b`) or `b[j]` will be equal to `a[i]` (meaning the loop has found a match between the current character in `a` and the current character in `b`). The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `k`, `i`, and the contents of stdin remain unchanged.
