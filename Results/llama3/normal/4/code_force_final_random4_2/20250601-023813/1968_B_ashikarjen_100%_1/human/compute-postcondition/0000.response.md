Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, a is a binary string of length n, b is a binary string of length m, k is 0, j is 0**

In this output state, the code has read the first test case from stdin, which originally contained t test cases. The values of n and m are now integers between 1 and 2 * 10^5, as specified in the precondition. The binary strings a and b have lengths n and m, respectively. The variables k and j are initialized to 0.
