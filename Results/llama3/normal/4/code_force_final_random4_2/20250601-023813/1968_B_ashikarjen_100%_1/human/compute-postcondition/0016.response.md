Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m`, `k` is 1 if `j` is less than `m`, otherwise `k` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is less than `m` and `j` is increased by 1, `b[j-1]` is not equal to `a[i]`, stdin contains t-1 test cases**

In this output state, the value of `j` has been incremented by 1, but it is still less than `m`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that `b[j-1]` is not equal to `a[i]` because `j` was incremented, so we are now considering the previous value of `j`.
