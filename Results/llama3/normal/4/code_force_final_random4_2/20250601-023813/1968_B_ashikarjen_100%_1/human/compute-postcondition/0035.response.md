Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m`, `i` is 2, `j` is less than `m` and is equal to `m` or `b[j]` is equal to `a[i]`, `k` is 0 if `j` is equal to `m`, otherwise `k` is 2, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**
