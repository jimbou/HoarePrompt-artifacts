The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m`, `i` is 2, `j` is equal to `m` or `b[j]` is equal to `a[i]`, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If `j` is less than `m`, then `k` is 2. Otherwise, `k` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
