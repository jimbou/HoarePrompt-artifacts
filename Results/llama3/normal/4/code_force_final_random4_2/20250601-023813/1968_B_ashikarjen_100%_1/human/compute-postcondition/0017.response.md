The variables in the loop head are j, m, b, a, and i. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables j, m, b, a, and i. If j is less than m and b[j] is not equal to a[i], the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, j is less than m and j is increased by 1, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, a is a binary string of length n, b is a binary string of length m, i is 1, and b[j-1] is not equal to a[i]. j being less than m does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to j is less than m-1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m`, `k` is 1 if `j` is less than `m`, otherwise `k` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is less than `m-1` and `j` is increased by 1, `b[j-1]` is not equal to `a[i]`, stdin contains t-1 test cases**
