Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer greater than 2, pre is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in s1, totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing either one or two elements, ans is a list of n-1 elements where the value at index i is calculated based on the number of '>' characters in s1 and the index i, i is n-3, el is either '<' or '>' depending on the character at index n-3 in s1, ol is the number of '>' characters in s1, zr is either 0 or 1 depending on whether suffZero has one or two elements, suffZero[-1] is suffZero[-1] + i + 1, ol is totalOne, zr is len(suffZero) - 1, ans[i] is zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 where zeroInd is suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2] and oneInd is 2 * func_1(preOne, zr).**

The final state includes all the information from the precondition that remains valid after the code execution. The code modifies the values of `ans[i]`, `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, `suffZero[-1]`, `ol`, and `zr`. The value of `ans[i]` is calculated based on the number of '>' characters in `s1` and the index `i`, and is assigned the value of `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`. The value of `zeroInd` is the sum of the last two elements of `suffZero`, and the value of `oneInd` is twice the result of calling `func_1` with `preOne` and `zr` as arguments. The value of `suffZero[-1]` is incremented by `i + 1`, and the value of `ol` is set to `totalOne`. The value of `zr` is set to `len(suffZero) - 1`.
