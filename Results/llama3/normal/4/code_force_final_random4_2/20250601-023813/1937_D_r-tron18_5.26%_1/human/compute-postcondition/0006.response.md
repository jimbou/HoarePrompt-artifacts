Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in s1, totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing a single element 0, ans is a list of n elements where the value at index i is zeroInd - oneInd, i is n - 1, el is '>', ol is the number of '>' characters in s1, and zr is 0.**

In this output state, the value of ans at index i is calculated as the difference between zeroInd and oneInd. zeroInd is calculated as 2 times the result of func_1(suffZero, ol), and oneInd is calculated as 2 times the last element of preOne minus the result of func_1(preOne, 1). The values of s1, n, pre, totalOne, preOne, suffZero, i, el, ol, and zr remain unchanged.
