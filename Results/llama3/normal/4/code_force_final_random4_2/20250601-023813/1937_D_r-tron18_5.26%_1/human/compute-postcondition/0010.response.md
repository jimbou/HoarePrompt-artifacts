Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in s1, totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1 minus 1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1 with the last element removed, suffZero is a list containing a single element 0, ans is a list of n elements where the value at index i is zeroInd - oneInd if the number of '>' characters in s1 is 0, otherwise the last element is zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi, i is n - 1, el is '>', and zr is 0.**

The code modifies the values of `totalOne` and `preOne`. The first line removes the last element from `preOne`, and the second line decrements `totalOne` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
