Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `pre` is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `suffZero` is a list containing either one or two elements, `ans` is a list of `n-1` elements where the value at index `i` is calculated based on the number of '>' characters in `s1` and the index `i`, `i` is `n-3`, `el` is either '<' or '>' depending on the character at index `n-3` in `s1`. If `el` is '>', then `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in `s1` with the last element removed, and `ol` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1, `zr` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `suffZero` has one or two elements. If `el` is '<', then `ol` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `zr` is the second last element in `suffZero`. Now `ol` is assigned the value of `totalOne` and `zr` is assigned the value of `len(suffZero) - 1`.**

In natural language, the code assigns the value of `totalOne` to `ol` and the second last index of `suffZero` to `zr`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
