Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in s1, totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing two elements: 0 and n, ans is a list of n elements where the last element is zeroInd - oneInd, i is n - 1, el is '<', ol is the number of '>' characters in s1, zr is 1.**

The code calculates the value of `zeroInd` by calling the function `func_1` twice with different arguments and then performs arithmetic operations on the results. It also calculates the value of `oneInd` by multiplying the last element of `preOne` by 2. Finally, it assigns the difference between `zeroInd` and `oneInd` to the last element of the list `ans`. The values of `s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, `i`, `el`, `ol`, and `zr` remain unchanged.
