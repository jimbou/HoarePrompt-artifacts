This function takes a string s1 of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>' as input and returns a list of calculated values. The function calculates the values based on the number of '>' characters in s1 and their indices. It processes the string from right to left, maintaining a running count of '>' characters and their indices. For each '<' character, it calculates a value based on the number of '>' characters and their indices, and for each '>' character, it calculates a value based on the number of '>' characters and their indices, as well as the number of '<' characters. The function returns a list of these calculated values, one for each character in the input string.
