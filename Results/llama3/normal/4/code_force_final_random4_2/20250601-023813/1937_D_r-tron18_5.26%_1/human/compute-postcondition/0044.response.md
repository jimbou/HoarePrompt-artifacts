The code prints the elements of the list `ans`. The list `ans` contains `n` elements, where `n` is the length of the string `s1`. Each element at index `i` in `ans` is calculated based on the number of '>' characters in `s1` and the index `i`.

Since the exact string `s1` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the elements in `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated values of `ans`.

Output: **[calculated values of ans] (where each value is calculated based on the number of '>' characters in s1 and the index i)**
