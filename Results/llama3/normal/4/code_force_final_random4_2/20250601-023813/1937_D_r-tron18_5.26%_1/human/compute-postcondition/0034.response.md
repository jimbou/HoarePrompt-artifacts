Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer greater than 2, pre is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in s1, totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing either one or two elements, ans is a list of n-1 elements where the value at index i is calculated based on the number of '>' characters in s1 and the index i, i is n-3, el is either '<' or '>' depending on the character at index n-3 in s1, ol is the number of '>' characters in s1, zr is either 0 or 1 depending on whether suffZero has one or two elements, ans[i] is zeroInd - oneInd.**

The code snippet calculates the value of `ans[i]` based on the number of '>' characters in `s1` and the index `i`. The value of `zeroInd` is calculated as twice the result of `func_1(suffZero, ol)`, and the value of `oneInd` is calculated as twice the last element of `preOne` minus the result of `func_1(preOne, 1)`. The value of `ans[i]` is then assigned the difference between `zeroInd` and `oneInd`. The values of `ol` and `zr` are updated based on the value of `el`, which depends on the character at index `n-3` in `s1`. If `el` is '>', then `ol` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1, and `zr` is 0. If `el` is '<', then `ol` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, and `zr` is the second last element in `suffZero`.
