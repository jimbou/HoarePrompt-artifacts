Postcondition: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer, `pre` is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `suffZero` is a list containing either one or two elements, `ans` is a list of `n-1` elements where the value at index `i` is calculated based on the number of '>' characters in `s1` and the index `i`, `i` is `n-2`, `el` is either '<' or '>' depending on the character at index `n-2` in `s1`, `ol` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `zr` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `suffZero` has one or two elements. If `ol` is less than or equal to `zr`, then `ans[n-2]` is equal to 2 * `func_1(suffZero, ol)` - (2 * `preOne[-1]` - `func_1(preOne, 1)`). Otherwise, `zeroInd` is 2 times the last element of `suffZero`, `oneInd` is the sum of the results of `func_1(preOne, zr)` and `func_1(preOne, zr + 1)` minus the result of `func_1(preOne, 1)`, and `fi` is the difference between the results of `func_1(preOne, zr + 1)` and `func_1(preOne, zr)`.**
