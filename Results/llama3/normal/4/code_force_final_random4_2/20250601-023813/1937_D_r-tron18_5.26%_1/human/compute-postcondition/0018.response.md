Postcondition: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer, `pre` is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `suffZero` is a list containing either one or two elements, `ans` is a list of `n` elements where the value at index `i` is calculated based on the number of '>' characters in `s1` and the index `i`. If `el` is '>', then `totalOne` is decremented by 1, `preOne` has its last element removed, and the last element of `ans` is calculated as `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`. If `el` is '<', then `suffZero` contains two elements, and if `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, the last element of `ans` is calculated as `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`, otherwise it is calculated as `zeroInd - oneInd`.**
