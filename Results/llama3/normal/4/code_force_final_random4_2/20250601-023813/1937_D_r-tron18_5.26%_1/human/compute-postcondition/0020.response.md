Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer, `pre` is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `suffZero` is a list containing either one or two elements, `ans` is a list of `n-1` elements where the value at index `i` is calculated based on the number of '>' characters in `s1` and the index `i`, `i` is `n-2`, `el` is either '<' or '>' depending on the character at index `n-2` in `s1`.**

In this output state, the value of `el` is determined by the character at index `n-2` in the string `s1`. If the character at index `n-2` is '<', then `el` is '<'. If the character at index `n-2` is '>', then `el` is '>'. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
