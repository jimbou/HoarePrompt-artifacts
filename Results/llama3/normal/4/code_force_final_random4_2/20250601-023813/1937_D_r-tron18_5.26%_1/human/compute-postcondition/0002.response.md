Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer, `pre` is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `suffZero` is a list containing a single element 0, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `i` is `n - 1`, `el` is either '<' or '>' depending on the character at index `i` in `s1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `s1` has a length of `n` and consists of '<' and '>' characters. The variable `n` is a positive integer. The list `pre` contains the 1-indexed positions of all '>' characters in `s1`. The variable `totalOne` stores the total count of '>' characters in `s1`. The list `preOne` contains the cumulative sum of the indices of '>' characters in `s1`. The list `suffZero` contains a single element, which is 0. The list `ans` contains `n` zeros. The variable `i` is set to `n - 1`. The variable `el` is assigned the character at index `i` in `s1`, which can be either '<' or '>'.
