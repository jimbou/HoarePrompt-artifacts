Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in s1, totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing two elements: 0 and n, ans is a list of n elements where the element at index i is zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1, i is n - 1, el is '<', ol is the number of '>' characters in s1, zr is 1.**

The code block calculates the value of `zeroInd` as the sum of the last two elements of `suffZero`, which are 0 and n, resulting in `zeroInd` being equal to n. Then, it calculates the value of `oneInd` as twice the result of calling `func_1(preOne, zr)`, but since the specific implementation of `func_1` is not provided, the exact value of `oneInd` cannot be determined. However, it is known that `zr` is 1 and `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in `s1`.

The code then assigns the value of `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1` to the element at index `i` in the list `ans`. Since `i` is `n - 1`, this modifies the last element of `ans`. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.
