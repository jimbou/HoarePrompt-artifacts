Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer, `pre` is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `suffZero` is a list containing either one or two elements, `ans` is a list of `n-1` elements where the value at index `i` is calculated based on the number of '>' characters in `s1` and the index `i`, `i` is `n-2`, `el` is either '<' or '>' depending on the character at index `n-2` in `s1`, `ol` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `zr` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `suffZero` has one or two elements.**

In this output state, the values of `s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, `ans`, `i`, and `el` remain the same as in the initial state. The new variables `ol` and `zr` are introduced, where `ol` is equal to the number of '>' characters in `s1` (i.e., `totalOne`) and `zr` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `suffZero` has one or two elements (i.e., `len(suffZero) - 1`).
