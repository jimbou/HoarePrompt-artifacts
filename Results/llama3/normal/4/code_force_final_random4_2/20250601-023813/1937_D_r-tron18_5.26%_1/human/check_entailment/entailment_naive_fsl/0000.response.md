Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when the input string contains consecutive '>' characters. In this case, the pinball will move to the right and then immediately move back to the left, but the program does not correctly calculate the number of steps it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.

For example, if the input string is '>>>', the program will output '1 4 7', but the correct output should be '1 3 5'. The program incorrectly calculates the number of steps it takes for the pinball to leave the grid because it does not correctly handle the case when the pinball moves to the right and then immediately moves back to the left.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and the Correctness is **False**.
