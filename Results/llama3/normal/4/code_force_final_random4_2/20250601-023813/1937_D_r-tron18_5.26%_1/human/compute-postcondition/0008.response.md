Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in s1, totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing a single element 0, ans is a list of n elements where the last element is zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi, i is n - 1, el is '>', ol is the number of '>' characters in s1, and zr is 0. The number of '>' characters in s1 is more than 0.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to include the calculated value `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi` at index `i`, which is `n - 1`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
