#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, times is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= times < len(arr).
    l = len(arr)

    #The program returns the difference between the last element of the list `arr` and the element at the index calculated by `max(-n, -1 - times)`, where `n` is not defined in the initial state but is used in the code snippet, assuming `n` is an integer, and `times` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= times < len(arr).

#Overall this is what the function does:Calculates the difference between the last element of a list and an element at a dynamic index, determined by the maximum of two values: the negative of an undefined integer `n` and the negative of 1 minus a non-negative integer `times`, which is less than the list length.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a string s1 of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>' as input and returns a list of calculated values. The function calculates the values based on the number of '>' characters in s1 and their indices. It processes the string from right to left, maintaining a running count of '>' characters and their indices. For each '<' character, it calculates a value based on the number of '>' characters and their indices, and for each '>' character, it calculates a value based on the number of '>' characters and their indices, as well as the number of '<' characters. The function returns a list of these calculated values, one for each character in the input string.
