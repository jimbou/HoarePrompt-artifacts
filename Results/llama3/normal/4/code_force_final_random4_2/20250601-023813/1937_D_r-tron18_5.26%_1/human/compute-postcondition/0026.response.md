Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in s1, totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing either one or two elements, ans is a list of n-1 elements where the value at index i is calculated based on the number of '>' characters in s1 and the index i, i is n-2, el is either '<' or '>' depending on the character at index n-2 in s1, ol is the number of '>' characters in s1, zr is the second last element in suffZero.**

The code block modifies the state of the variables as follows:

*   The first line appends the sum of the last element in `suffZero` and `i + 1` to `suffZero`. Since `i` is `n-2`, this operation effectively adds `n-1` to the last element in `suffZero`.
*   The second line assigns the value of `totalOne` to `ol` and the second last element of `suffZero` to `zr`. The value of `totalOne` remains unchanged, and `zr` takes the value of the second last element in `suffZero`.

All other variables (`s1`, `n`, `pre`, `preOne`, `ans`, `i`, and `el`) remain unchanged by the code block.
