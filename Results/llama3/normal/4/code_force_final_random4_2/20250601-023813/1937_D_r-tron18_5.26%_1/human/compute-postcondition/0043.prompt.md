Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in s1, totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing a single element 0, and ans is a list of n zeros.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    el = s1[i]
    if el == '>':
        ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1
        if ol <= zr:
            zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)
            oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd
        else:
            zeroInd = 2 * suffZero[-1]
            oneInd = func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)
            oneInd -= func_1(preOne, 1)
            fi = func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi
        preOne.pop()
        totalOne -= 1
    else:
        suffZero.append(suffZero[-1] + i + 1)
        ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1
        if zr <= ol:
            zeroInd = suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]
            oneInd = 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1
        else:
            zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)
            oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1]
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer, `pre` is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `suffZero` is a list containing either one or two elements, `ans` is a list of `n` elements where the value at index `i` is calculated based on the number of '>' characters in `s1` and the index `i`. If `el` is '>', then `totalOne` is decremented by 1, `preOne` has its last element removed, and the last element of `ans` is calculated as `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`. If `el` is '<', then `suffZero` contains two elements, and if `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, the last element of `ans` is calculated as `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`, otherwise it is calculated as `zeroInd - oneInd`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in s1, totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing either one or two elements, ans is a list of n-1 elements where the value at index i is calculated based on the number of '>' characters in s1 and the index i, i is n-2, el is either '<' or '>' depending on the character at index n-2 in s1. If el is '>', then totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1 minus 1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1 with the last element removed, and ol is the number of '>' characters in s1 minus 1, zr is either 0 or 1 depending on whether suffZero has one or two elements. If el is '<', then ol is the number of '>' characters in s1, zr is the second last element in suffZero. If zr is less than or equal to ol, then ans[i] is the difference between the sum of the last two elements in suffZero and twice the result of func_1(preOne, zr) plus n + 1. Otherwise, ans[i] is the difference between 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1) and 2 * preOne[-1].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `pre` is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `suffZero` is a list containing either one or two elements, `ans` is a list of `n-1` elements where the value at index `i` is calculated based on the number of '>' characters in `s1` and the index `i`, `i` is `n-3`, `el` is either '<' or '>' depending on the character at index `n-3` in `s1`. If `el` is '>', then `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in `s1` with the last element removed, and `ol` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1, `zr` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `suffZero` has one or two elements. If `el` is '<', then `ol` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `zr` is the second last element in `suffZero`. If `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, then `ans[i]` is the difference between the sum of the last two elements in `suffZero` and twice the result of `func_1(preOne, zr)` plus `n + 1`. Otherwise, `ans[i]` is the difference between 2 * `func_1(suffZero, ol + 1)` - `func_1(suffZero, 1)` and 2 * `preOne[-1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
