Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `pre` is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `suffZero` is a list containing either one or two elements, `ans` is a list of `n-1` elements where the value at index `i` is calculated based on the number of '>' characters in `s1` and the index `i`, `i` is `n-3`, `el` is either '<' or '>' depending on the character at index `n-3` in `s1`. If `el` is '>', then `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in `s1` with the last element removed, and `ol` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1, `zr` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `suffZero` has one or two elements. If `el` is '<', then `ol` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `zr` is the second last element in `suffZero`. If `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, then `ans[i]` is the difference between the sum of the last two elements in `suffZero` and twice the result of `func_1(preOne, zr)` plus `n + 1`. Otherwise, `ans[i]` is the difference between 2 * `func_1(suffZero, ol + 1)` - `func_1(suffZero, 1)` and 2 * `preOne[-1]`.**

The code assigns the value of the character at index `n-3` in `s1` to `el`. The value of `el` is either '<' or '>' depending on the character at index `n-3` in `s1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
