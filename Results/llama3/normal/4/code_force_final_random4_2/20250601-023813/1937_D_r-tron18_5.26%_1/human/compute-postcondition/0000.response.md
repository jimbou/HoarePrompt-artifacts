Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in s1, totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing a single element 0, and ans is a list of n zeros.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The string `s1` remains unchanged, consisting of `n` characters that are either '<' or '>'. The variable `n` also remains unchanged, representing the length of the string `s1`.

The list `pre` contains the 1-indexed positions of all '>' characters in `s1`. For example, if `s1` is '<>><<>', `pre` would be `[2, 4]`.

The variable `totalOne` stores the total count of '>' characters in `s1`, which is the same as the length of the `pre` list.

The list `preOne` contains the cumulative sums of the indices of '>' characters in `s1`. Using the same example as above, `preOne` would be `[0, 2, 6]`, where the first element is the initial value 0, the second element is the sum of the first index (2), and the third element is the sum of the first two indices (2 + 4).

The list `suffZero` contains a single element, which is 0.

Finally, the list `ans` is initialized with `n` zeros, where `n` is the length of the string `s1`.
