Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in s1, totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing either one or two elements, ans is a list of n-1 elements where the value at index i is calculated based on the number of '>' characters in s1 and the index i, i is n-2, el is either '<' or '>' depending on the character at index n-2 in s1, ol is the number of '>' characters in s1, zr is the second last element in suffZero, zeroInd is 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1), oneInd is 2 * preOne[-1], ans[i] is zeroInd - oneInd.**

The code block calculates the value of `ans[i]` based on the number of '>' characters in `s1` and the index `i`. It uses the functions `func_1` to calculate `zeroInd` and `oneInd`, and then assigns the difference between `zeroInd` and `oneInd` to `ans[i]`. The values of `s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, `i`, `el`, `ol`, and `zr` remain unchanged.
