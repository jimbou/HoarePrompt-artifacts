The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` was 0, so the new value of `j` is 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains t-1 test cases. The first character of `a` is still not equal to the first character of `b`. The length of `a` is still `n` and the length of `b` is still `m`. `n` is still an integer greater than 0, `m` is still greater than 0, `k` is still 0, and `i` is still 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `a` is a binary string of length `n` where the first character is not equal to the first character of `b`, `b` is a binary string of length `m`, `k` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**
