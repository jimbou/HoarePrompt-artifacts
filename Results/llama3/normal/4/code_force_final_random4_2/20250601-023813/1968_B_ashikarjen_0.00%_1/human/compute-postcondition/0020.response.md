Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m`, `k` is 1 if `j` is less than `m`, otherwise `k` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is increased by 1 and must be less than `m`, `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[i]`, and stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `j` is increased by 1, but it is still less than `m`. The values of the other variables remain the same. The condition that `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[i]` is still valid. The stdin still contains t-1 test cases.
