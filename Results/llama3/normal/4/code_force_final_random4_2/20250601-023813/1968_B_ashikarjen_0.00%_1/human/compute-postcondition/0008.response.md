Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m`, `k` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is `m`, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

The loop will continue to execute until `j` is no longer less than `m` or until `b[j]` is equal to `a[i]`. If `b[j]` is never equal to `a[i]`, then `j` will continue to increment until it is equal to `m`. If `b[j]` is equal to `a[i]` before `j` reaches `m`, then the loop will terminate early. In either case, the final value of `j` will be `m`. The values of `n`, `a`, `k`, `i`, and stdin remain unchanged throughout the loop's execution.
