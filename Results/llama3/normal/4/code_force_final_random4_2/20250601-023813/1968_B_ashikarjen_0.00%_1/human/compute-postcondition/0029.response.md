Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m`, `i` is 2, `j` is less than `m` and `j` is increased by 1, and `b[j-1]` is not equal to `a[i]`.**

In this output state, the value of `j` has been incremented by 1, but it is still less than `m`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition `b[j]` is not equal to `a[i]` is now `b[j-1]` is not equal to `a[i]` because `j` has been incremented.
