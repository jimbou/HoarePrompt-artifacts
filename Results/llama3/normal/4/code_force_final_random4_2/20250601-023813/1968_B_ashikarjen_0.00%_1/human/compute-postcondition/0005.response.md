Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is greater than 1, `a` is a binary string of length `n` where the first character is not equal to the first character of `b`, `b` is a binary string of length `m` where the second character is not equal to the first character of `b`, `k` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `j` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `j` being equal to 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-1 test cases.
