Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m`, `k` is 1 if `j` is less than `m`, otherwise `k` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is increased by 1 and must be less than or equal to `m`, and stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `j` has been incremented by 1, but its relationship with `m` is still maintained. The other variables remain unchanged.
