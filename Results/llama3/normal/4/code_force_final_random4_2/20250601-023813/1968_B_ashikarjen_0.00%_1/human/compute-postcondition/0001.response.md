To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Since `n` is an integer, we can adjust its state to be greater than 0. Additionally, we can adjust the state of `i` to be 0, which is the starting value of the range.

State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer, a is a binary string of length n, b is a binary string of length m, k is 0, j is 0, i is 0**
