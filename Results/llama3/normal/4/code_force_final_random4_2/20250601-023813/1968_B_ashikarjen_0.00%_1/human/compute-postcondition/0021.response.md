Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m`, `k` is 1 if `j` is less than `m`, otherwise `k` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is equal to `m` or `b[j]` is equal to `a[i]`, and stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations means that the loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `m` and `b[j]` is not equal to `a[i]`. Once `j` is equal to `m` or `b[j]` is equal to `a[i]`, the loop will terminate. The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged, and the value of `j` is either equal to `m` or `b[j]` is equal to `a[i]`.
