Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m`, `i` is 2, `j` is equal to `m` or `b[j]` is equal to `a[i]`, and `k` is 0 if `j` is equal to `m` or `k` is 2 if `j` is less than `m`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations means that the loop will continue to execute until `j` is no longer less than `m` or until `b[j]` is equal to `a[i]`. At this point, the loop will terminate, and the values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `i` will remain unchanged. The value of `j` will be either equal to `m` or the index at which `b[j]` is equal to `a[i]`. The value of `k` will be 0 if `j` is equal to `m` (meaning the loop terminated because `j` reached the end of the string `b`) or 2 if `j` is less than `m` (meaning the loop terminated because `b[j]` is equal to `a[i]`).
