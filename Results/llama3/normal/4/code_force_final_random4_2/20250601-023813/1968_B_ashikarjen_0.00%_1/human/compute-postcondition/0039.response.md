Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 2, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m`, `i` is 2. If `j` is less than `m` and `b[j]` is equal to `a[i]`, then `k` is 3. If `j` is equal to `m`, then `k` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
