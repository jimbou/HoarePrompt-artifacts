Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m`, `k` is 1 if `j` is less than `m`, otherwise `k` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is either less than or equal to `m` or equal to `m` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and stdin contains t-1 test cases.***
