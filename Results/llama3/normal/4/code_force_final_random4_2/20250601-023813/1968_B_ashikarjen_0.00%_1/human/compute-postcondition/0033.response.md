Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m`, `i` is 2, `j` is less than `m` and greater than its previous value, and `b[j-1]` is not equal to `a[i]` is not guaranteed.**

In this output state, the value of `j` has been incremented by 1, so it is now greater than its previous value. However, the relationship between `b[j-1]` and `a[i]` is no longer guaranteed, as the value of `j` has changed. The other variables remain unchanged.
