Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m`, `k` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is equal to `m`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `k`, `i`, and `j` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The stdin still contains t-1 test cases.
