Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m`, `k` is 1 if `j` is less than `m`, otherwise `k` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is equal to `m` or `b[j]` is equal to `a[i]`, and stdin contains t-1 test cases. Additionally, `j` is not less than `m`***
