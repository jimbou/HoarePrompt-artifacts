Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 1, `b` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `c` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, then if `k` is equal to `c` or `j` is equal to `b - 1`, `j` is set to 0 and `k` is set to 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables. If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, then `j` is 0 and `k` is 0.***
