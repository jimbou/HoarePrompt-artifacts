Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 2, `b` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `c` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`, `j` is 0, and `k` is the index of the first occurrence of `d[j]` in the substring of `e` starting from index `k`, plus 1 plus the original value of `k`. The current value of `k` is equal to `c` or the current value of `j` is equal to `b - 1`***
