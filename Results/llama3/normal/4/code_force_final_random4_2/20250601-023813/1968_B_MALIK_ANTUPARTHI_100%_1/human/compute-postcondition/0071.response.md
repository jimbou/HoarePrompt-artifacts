Output State: **`a` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 2, `b` is an integer greater than 3 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, `c` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`, `j` is 0, `k` is the index of `d[j]` in `e` plus 1, if `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, otherwise `k` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `a`, `i`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `j` is reset to 0. The value of `k` is updated to be the index of `d[j]` in `e` plus 1, but only if `d[j]` is found in the substring of `e` starting from the current value of `k`. If `d[j]` is not found in this substring, `k` is reset to 0.
