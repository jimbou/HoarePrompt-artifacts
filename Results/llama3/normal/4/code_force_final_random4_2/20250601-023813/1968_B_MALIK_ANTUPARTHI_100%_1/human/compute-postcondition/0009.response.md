Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `b` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and must be at least 1, `c` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`, `k` is 0, `j` is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases. The character at index `j` in string `d` is not present in the substring of `e` starting from index `k`.***
