Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `b` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 and must be at least 2, `c` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`, `j` is 0, `k` is between 1 and `c` (inclusive) and equals 1 plus the index of `d[j]` in `e[k:]` plus `k`**.

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated to be 1 plus the index of `d[j]` in `e[k:]` plus `k`. The index of `d[j]` in `e[k:]` is between 0 and `c - k` (inclusive), so `k` is between 1 and `c` (inclusive). The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
