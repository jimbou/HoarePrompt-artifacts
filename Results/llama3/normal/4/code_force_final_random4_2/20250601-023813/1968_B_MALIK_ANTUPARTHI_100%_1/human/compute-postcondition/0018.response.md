The only variable in the loop head is variable `j` and `b`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `b`. If `j` is less than `b`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `b` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 and must be at least 2. For the loop to execute again `j` is increased by 1 so `j` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `b` must be greater than 1.
State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `b` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 and must be at least 2, `c` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, then if `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, `j` is 0 and `k` is 1. Otherwise, the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, then `j` is 0 and `k` is 1, `j` is 1 and `b` is greater than 1**
