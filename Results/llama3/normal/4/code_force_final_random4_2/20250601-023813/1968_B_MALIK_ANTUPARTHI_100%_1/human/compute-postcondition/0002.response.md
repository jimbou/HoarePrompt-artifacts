Output State: **a is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 0, b is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, c is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, d is a binary string of length b, e is a binary string of length c, k is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases.**

The code block reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to `b` and `c`, then reads two binary strings and assigns them to `d` and `e`. The variable `k` is initialized to 0. The value of `a` and `i` remains unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 1.
