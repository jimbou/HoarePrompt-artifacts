The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and b, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `b`. If `j` is less than `b`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `b` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and must be at least 1. For the loop to execute again `j` is increased by 1 so `j` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `b` must be at least 2.
State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `b` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 and must be at least 2, `c` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, then `k` is set to `j + 1` and `j` is reset to 0 if `k` is equal to `c` or `j` is equal to `b - 1`, otherwise no changes are made to the variables. If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, then `k` is set to `j` and `j` is reset to 0. stdin contains t-2 test cases, `j` is 1**
