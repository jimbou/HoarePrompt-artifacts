Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `b` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and must be at least 1, `c` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, then `k` is set to `j + 1` and `j` is reset to 0 if `k` is equal to `c` or `j` is equal to `b - 1`, otherwise no changes are made to the variables. If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, then `k` is set to `j` and `j` is reset to 0. stdin contains t-2 test cases.***
