Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 1, `b` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, `c` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`, `k` is equal to the index of `d[j]` in `e[k:]` plus 1 plus `k`, `j` is either equal to `b - 1` or `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, and `i` remains the same as in the initial state. The value of `k` is updated to be the index of `d[j]` in the substring of `e` starting from index `k`, plus 1, plus the original value of `k`. The value of `j` is either equal to `b - 1` or `d[j]` is found in the substring of `e` starting from index `k`.
