Postcondition: **`a` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 2, `b` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `c` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`. If `k` is equal to `c` or `j` is equal to `b - 1`, then `j` is 0 and `k` is equal to `j + 1`. Otherwise, the values of `j` and `k` are updated according to the program logic.**
