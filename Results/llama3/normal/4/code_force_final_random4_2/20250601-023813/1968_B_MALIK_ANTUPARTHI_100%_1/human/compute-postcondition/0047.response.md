Postcondition: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 1, `b` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, `c` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`. If `k` is equal to `c` or `j` is equal to `b - 1`, then `j` is either equal to `b - 1` or `d[j]` is in `e[k:]` and `k` is equal to `j + 1`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
