Postcondition: **`a` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 2, `b` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `c` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, then if `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, `j` is 0 and `k` is 1. Otherwise, the values of `j` and `k` are updated according to the program logic. If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, then `j` is 0 and `k` is 0.**
