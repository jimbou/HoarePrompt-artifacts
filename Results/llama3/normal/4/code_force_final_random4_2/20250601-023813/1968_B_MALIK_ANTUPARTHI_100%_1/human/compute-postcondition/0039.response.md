Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 1, `b` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, `c` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`, `k` is equal to the index of `d[j]` in `e[k:]` plus 1 plus `k`.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated to be the index of `d[j]` in `e[k:]` plus 1 plus the original value of `k`. This means that `k` now points to the position of `d[j]` in the substring of `e` starting from the original value of `k`. The other variables remain unchanged.
