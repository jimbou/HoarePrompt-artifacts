Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `b` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 and must be at least 2, `c` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`, `j` is 0, `k` is the index of `d[j]` in `e` plus 1 plus the previous value of `k`.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated to be the index of `d[j]` in `e` plus 1 plus the previous value of `k`. The value of `j` has been reset to 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that the value of `k` is now dependent on the previous value of `k` and the index of `d[j]` in `e`.
