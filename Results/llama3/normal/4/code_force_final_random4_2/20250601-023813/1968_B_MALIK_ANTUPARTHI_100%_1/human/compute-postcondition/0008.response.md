Postcondition: ***a is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 0, b is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and must be at least 1, c is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, d is a binary string of length b, e is a binary string of length c, if k is equal to c or j is equal to b - 1, then k is equal to j + 1 and j is 0, otherwise no changes are made to the variables. stdin contains t-2 test cases.***
