The value of `k` is updated to be the index of the first occurrence of `d[j]` in the substring of `e` starting from index `k`, plus 1, plus the original value of `k`. The values of the other variables are not affected. Since `d[j]` is present in the substring of `e` starting from index `k`, the new value of `k` is at least `k` and at most `c`. The value of `k` is also at least 1 because `d[j]` is present in the substring of `e` starting from index `k`. 

Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `b` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and must be at least 1, `c` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`, `k` is an integer between 1 and `c`, `j` is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases.**
