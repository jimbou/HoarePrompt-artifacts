The only variable in the loop head is variable `j` and `b`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `b`. If `j` is less than `b`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, `b` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5. For the loop to execute again `j` is increased by 1 so `j` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `b` must be greater than 3.
State: **`a` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 2, `b` is an integer greater than 3 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, `c` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, then if `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, `j` is 0 and `k` is 1. Otherwise, the values of `j` and `k` are updated according to the program logic. If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, then `j` is 0 and `k` is 0.**
