Output State: **a is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 1, b is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, c is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, d is a binary string of length b, e is a binary string of length c, j is either equal to b - 1 or d[j] is in e[k:], k is equal to j + 1.**

In this output state, the value of `a`, `i`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `k` is updated to be equal to `j + 1`, and the value of `j` remains either equal to `b - 1` or `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`.
