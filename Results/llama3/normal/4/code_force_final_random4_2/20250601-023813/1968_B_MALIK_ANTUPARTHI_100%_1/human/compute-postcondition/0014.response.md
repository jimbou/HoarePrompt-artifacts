Output State: **a is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 0, b is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 and must be at least 2, c is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, d is a binary string of length b, e is a binary string of length c, j is 0, k is 1.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the value of `j + 1` to `k`. Since `j` is 0, `k` becomes 1. The second line is a `break` statement, which does not affect any variables. Therefore, the final state of the variables is as follows: `a` remains an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` remains 0, `b` remains an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 and must be at least 2, `c` remains an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `d` remains a binary string of length `b`, `e` remains a binary string of length `c`, `j` remains 0, and `k` becomes 1.
