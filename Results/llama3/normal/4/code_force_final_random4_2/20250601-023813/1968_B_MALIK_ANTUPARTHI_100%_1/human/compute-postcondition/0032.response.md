Postcondition: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 1, `b` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `c` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`, `j` is 0, `k` is the index of the character at index `j` in string `d` in the substring of `e` starting from index `k` plus 1 plus `k`. The current value of `k` is either equal to `c` or the current value of `j` is equal to `b - 1`.**
