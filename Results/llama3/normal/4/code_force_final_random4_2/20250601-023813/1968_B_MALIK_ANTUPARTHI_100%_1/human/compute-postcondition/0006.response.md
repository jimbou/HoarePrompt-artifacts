Postcondition: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `b` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and must be at least 1, `c` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `d` is a binary string of length `b`, `e` is a binary string of length `c`, `k` is an integer between 1 and `c`, `j` is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases. The current value of `k` is equal to `c` or the current value of `j` is equal to `b - 1`.**
