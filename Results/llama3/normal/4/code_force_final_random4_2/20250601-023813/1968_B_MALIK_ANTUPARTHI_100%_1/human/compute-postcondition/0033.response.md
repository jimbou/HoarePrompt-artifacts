Output State: **a is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 1, b is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, c is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, d is a binary string of length b, e is a binary string of length c, j is 0, k is 1.**

The code block consists of two lines. The first line assigns the value of `j + 1` to `k`. Since `j` is 0, `k` becomes 1. The second line is a `break` statement, which does not affect any variables. 

Therefore, the only change in the output state is the value of `k`, which is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
