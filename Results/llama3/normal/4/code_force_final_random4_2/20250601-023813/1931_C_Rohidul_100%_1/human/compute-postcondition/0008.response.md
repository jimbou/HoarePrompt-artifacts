Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first input, a is a list of n integers, le is equal to n, l is equal to r, st is equal to l + 1, end is 1, stdin contains t - 1 inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and then n - l - 1 integers a_l + 2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n), _ is 0, input() must be greater than 0**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `a` has been traversed from the left until a pair of unequal elements is found. The variable `l` points to the first element of this pair, and `st` is one more than `l`. The rest of the state remains unchanged.
