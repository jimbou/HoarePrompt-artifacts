Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers where a[0] equals a[1], a[2] equals a[3], a[4] equals a[5], le equals n, l is less than n - 3, r equals n - 4, st equals n, end equals 4, ans equals n - (n + n), _ equals 2, stdin contains t - 3 inputs, input() must be greater than 0, and the maximum length of the subarray that can be obtained by removing at most one element from the list a such that the remaining elements are equal is not printed. Additionally, if the first and last elements of the list a are equal, then the first and last elements of the list a are equal, and the value of ans which is equal to -n is printed, and a[r] equals a[r - 1].**

In this final state, the value of `r` has been decremented by 1, making it `n - 4`, and the value of `end` has been incremented by 1, making it 4. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
