The variables in the loop head are r and l and a[r] and a[r - 1], so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables r, l, a[r] and a[r - 1]. If r is greater than l and a[r] is equal to a[r - 1], the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, r is greater than l and a[r] is equal to a[r - 1]. r being greater than l does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to r is greater than l + 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n is an integer equal to the first input, a is a list of n integers with at least two equal elements and a[r] is equal to a[r - 1], le is equal to n, l is less than r - 1, st is equal to l + 1, end is 3, stdin contains t - 1 inputs, _ is 0, input() must be greater than 0, r is greater than l + 1**
