Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers where the first n elements are equal, le is equal to n, l is equal to n - 1, r is equal to n - 1, st is equal to n, end is equal to 1, ans is not assigned a value, _ is 1, stdin contains t - 3 inputs, input() must be greater than 0, and the maximum length of the subarray that can be obtained by removing at most one element from the list a such that the remaining elements are equal is not printed.**

The loop will continue to execute as long as `l` is less than `r` and `a[l]` is equal to `a[l + 1]`. After the first iteration, `l` is incremented to 1, and `st` is incremented to 2. After the second iteration, `l` is incremented to 2, and `st` is incremented to 3. After the third iteration, `l` is incremented to 3, and `st` is incremented to 4. This pattern continues until `l` is no longer less than `r`, which happens when `l` is equal to `n - 1` and `r` is equal to `n - 1`. At this point, `st` is equal to `n`. The other variables in the precondition remain unchanged.
