Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers where the first two elements are equal, le is equal to n, l is equal to 1, r is equal to n - 1, st is equal to 2, end is equal to 1, ans is not assigned a value, _ is 1, stdin contains t - 3 inputs, input() must be greater than 0, and the maximum length of the subarray that can be obtained by removing at most one element from the list a such that the remaining elements are equal is not printed**

The code increments `l` by 1 and `st` by 1. No other variables are affected. The value of `l` changes from 0 to 1, and the value of `st` changes from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
