Output State: **`_` is equal to `t`, stdin is empty, input() is equal to 0, and the maximum length of the subarray that can be obtained by removing at most one element from the list `a` such that the remaining elements are equal is printed for each test case.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop executes all the iterations, the loop counter `_` will be equal to the total number of test cases `t`, the standard input `stdin` will be empty because all inputs have been processed, the `input()` function will return 0 because there are no more inputs to read, and the maximum length of the subarray that can be obtained by removing at most one element from the list `a` such that the remaining elements are equal will be printed for each test case.
