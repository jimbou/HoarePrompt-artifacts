The only objects in the loop head are variables  _ and input(), so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input().  If the input() has at least 2 inputs the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, input() has at least 3 inputs, _ is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the input() must have at least 2 inputs and the _ is 2.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first `n` elements are equal, `le` is equal to `n`, `l` is equal to 0, `r` is equal to 0, `st` is equal to `n`, `end` is equal to `n`, `ans` is equal to `n - (n + n)`, `_` is 2, stdin contains t - 2 inputs, input() must be greater than 0, and the maximum length of the subarray that can be obtained by removing at most one element from the list `a` such that the remaining elements are equal is not printed. Additionally, if the first and last elements of the list `a` are equal, then the first and last elements of the list `a` are equal, and the value of ans which is equal to -n is printed**
