Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first input, a is a list of n integers, le is equal to n, l is 0, r is n - 1, st is 1, end is 1, stdin contains t - 1 inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n), _ is 0, input() must be greater than 0**

The first line assigns the integer value of the first input to `n`. The second line assigns a list of `n` integers from the second input to `a`. The third line assigns the length of `a` (which is `n`) to `le`. The fourth line initializes `l` to 0 and `r` to `n - 1`. The fifth line initializes `st` and `end` to 1. No other variables are affected.
