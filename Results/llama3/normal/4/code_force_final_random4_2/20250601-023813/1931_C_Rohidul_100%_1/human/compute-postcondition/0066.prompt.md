Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4), then for each test case, first an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    le = len(a)
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    st, end = 1, 1
    while l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]:
        l += 1
        st += 1
    while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
        r -= 1
        end += 1
    ans = le - max(st, end)
    if a[0] == a[-1]:
        ans = max(0, le - (st + end))
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `le` is equal to `n`, `l` is equal to `r`, `st` is equal to `l + 1`, `end` is equal to the number of equal elements at the end of the list, `ans` is equal to `max(0, le - (st + end))` if the first and last elements of `a` are equal, otherwise `ans` is equal to `le - max(l + 1, end)`, `_` is 0, stdin contains `t - 1` inputs, input() must be greater than 0, and the maximum length of the subarray that can be obtained by removing at most one element from the list `a` such that the remaining elements are equal is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first `n` elements are equal, `le` is equal to `n`, `l` is equal to 0, `r` is equal to 0, `st` is equal to `n`, `end` is equal to `n`, `ans` is equal to `n - (n + n)`, `_` is 1, stdin contains t - 3 inputs, input() must be greater than 0, and the maximum length of the subarray that can be obtained by removing at most one element from the list `a` such that the remaining elements are equal is not printed. Additionally, if the first and last elements of the list `a` are equal, then the first and last elements of the list `a` are equal, and the value of ans which is equal to -n is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0]` equals `a[1]`, `a[2]` equals `a[3]`, `a[4]` equals `a[5]`, `le` equals `n`, `l` equals 0, `r` equals 0, `st` equals `n`, `end` equals `n - 1`, `ans` equals `n - max(n, n - 1)`, `_` equals 2, stdin contains `t - 3` inputs, input() must be greater than 0. If the first and last elements of the list `a` are equal, then `ans` equals 0 and the value of `ans` which is 0 is printed. Otherwise, the maximum length of the subarray that can be obtained by removing at most one element from the list `a` such that the remaining elements are equal is not printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
