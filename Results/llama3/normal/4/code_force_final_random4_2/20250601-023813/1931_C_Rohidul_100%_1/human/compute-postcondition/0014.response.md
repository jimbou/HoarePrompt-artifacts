Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first input, a is a list of n integers with at least two equal elements and a[r] is equal to a[r - 1], le is equal to n, l is less than r, st is equal to l + 1, end is 4, stdin contains t - 1 inputs, _ is 0, input() must be greater than 0**

In this output state, the value of `r` has been decremented by 1, and the value of `end` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` still contains at least two equal elements, and `a[r]` is still equal to `a[r - 1]`. The relationship between `l` and `r` has changed, with `l` now being less than `r` instead of `r - 1`. The value of `end` is now 4. The state of `stdin` and the constraint on `input()` remain the same.
