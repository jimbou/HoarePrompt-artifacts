Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers where a[0] equals a[1], a[2] equals a[3], a[4] equals a[5], le is equal to n, l is equal to n - 1, r is equal to n - 1, st is equal to n, end is equal to 1, ans is equal to n - (n + n), _ is 2, stdin contains t - 3 inputs, input() must be greater than 0, and the maximum length of the subarray that can be obtained by removing at most one element from the list a such that the remaining elements are equal is not printed. Additionally, if the first and last elements of the list a are equal, then the first and last elements of the list a are equal, and the value of ans which is equal to -n is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `a` has pairs of equal elements at indices 0 and 1, 2 and 3, and so on, until the second last and last elements. The variable `l` has reached the second last index of the list, and `r` remains at the last index. The variable `st` has increased to the length of the list `n`. The other variables remain unchanged.
