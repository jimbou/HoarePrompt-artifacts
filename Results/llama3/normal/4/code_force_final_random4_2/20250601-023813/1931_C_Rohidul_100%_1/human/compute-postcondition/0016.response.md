Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `le` is equal to `n`, `l` is equal to `r`, `st` is equal to `l + 1`, `end` is equal to the number of equal elements at the end of the list, `ans` is equal to `le - max(l + 1, end)`, `_` is 0, stdin contains `t - 1` inputs, input() must be greater than 0.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` is calculated based on the values of `le`, `st`, and `end`. Since `st` is equal to `l + 1` and `l` is equal to `r`, `st` is also equal to `r + 1`. The value of `ans` is then equal to `le - max(r + 1, end)`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
