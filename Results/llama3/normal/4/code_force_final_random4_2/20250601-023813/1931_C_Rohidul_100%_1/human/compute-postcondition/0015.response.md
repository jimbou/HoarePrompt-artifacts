Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first input, a is a list of n integers, le is equal to n, l is equal to r, st is equal to l + 1, end is equal to the number of equal elements at the end of the list, stdin contains t - 1 inputs, _ is 0, input() must be greater than 0.**

This output state means that after the loop has finished executing, the variables `n`, `le`, `st`, `_`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The variable `end` now holds the number of equal elements at the end of the list `a`. The variables `l` and `r` are now equal, indicating that the loop has finished iterating over the list.
