The variables in the loop head are l, r, and a. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables l, r, and a. If l is less than r and a[l] is equal to a[l + 1], the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, l is 1, r is n - 1, and a[l] is equal to a[l + 1]. For the loop to execute again, l must be less than r and a[l] must be equal to a[l + 1]. Since l is 1 and r is n - 1, l must be less than n - 1, so n must be greater than 2. Also, a[l] must be equal to a[l + 1], so a[1] must be equal to a[2]. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **n is an integer equal to the first input and n is greater than 2, a is a list of n integers where the first three elements are equal, le is equal to n, l is 1, r is n - 1, st is 2, end is 1, stdin contains t - 1 inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and then n - 1 integers a_3, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n), _ is 0, input() must be greater than 0**
