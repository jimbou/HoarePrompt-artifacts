To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `stdin`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `int(input())`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0 and `stdin` contains `t - 1` inputs. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be increased by 1, and `stdin` must contain `t - 2` inputs.

State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `le` is equal to `n`, `l` is equal to `r`, `st` is equal to `l + 1`, `end` is equal to the number of equal elements at the end of the list, `ans` is equal to `max(0, le - (st + end))` if the first and last elements of `a` are equal, otherwise `ans` is equal to `le - max(l + 1, end)`, `_` is 1, stdin contains `t - 2` inputs, input() must be greater than 0, and the maximum length of the subarray that can be obtained by removing at most one element from the list `a` such that the remaining elements are equal is printed**
