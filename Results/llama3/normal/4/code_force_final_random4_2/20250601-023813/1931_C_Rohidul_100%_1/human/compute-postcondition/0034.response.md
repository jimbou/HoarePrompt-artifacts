Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers where the first n elements are equal, le is equal to n, l is equal to n - 1, r is equal to n - 2, st is equal to n, end is equal to 3, ans is not assigned a value, _ is 1, stdin contains t - 3 inputs, input() must be greater than 0, and the maximum length of the subarray that can be obtained by removing at most one element from the list a such that the remaining elements are equal is not printed.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `r` and `end`. The first line decrements `r` by 1, making it equal to `n - 2`. The second line increments `end` by 1, making it equal to 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
