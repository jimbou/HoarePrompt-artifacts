Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers where the first n elements are equal, le is equal to n, l is equal to 0, r is equal to 0, st is equal to n, end is equal to n, ans is not assigned a value, _ is 1, stdin contains t - 3 inputs, input() must be greater than 0, and the maximum length of the subarray that can be obtained by removing at most one element from the list a such that the remaining elements are equal is not printed.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variables 'l' and 'r' are both equal to 0, and 'end' is equal to 'n'. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
