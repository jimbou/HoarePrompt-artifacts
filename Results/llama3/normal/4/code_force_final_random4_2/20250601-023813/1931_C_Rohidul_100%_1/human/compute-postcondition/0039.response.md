Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first `n` elements are equal, `le` is equal to `n`, `l` is equal to 0, `r` is equal to 0, `st` is equal to `n`, `end` is equal to `n`, `ans` is equal to `n - max(n, n)`, `_` is 1, stdin contains t - 3 inputs, input() must be greater than 0, and the maximum length of the subarray that can be obtained by removing at most one element from the list `a` such that the remaining elements are equal is not printed. Additionally, the first and last elements of the list `a` are equal.***
