Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers where the first four elements are equal, le is equal to n, l is equal to 3, r is greater than 2, st is equal to 4, end is equal to 1, ans is not assigned a value, _ is 1, stdin contains t - 3 inputs, input() must be greater than 0, and the maximum length of the subarray that can be obtained by removing at most one element from the list a such that the remaining elements are equal is not printed.**

In this final state, the value of `l` has been incremented by 1, making it equal to 3, and the value of `st` has been incremented by 1, making it equal to 4. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
