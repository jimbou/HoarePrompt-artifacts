Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0]` equals `a[1]`, `a[2]` equals `a[3]`, `a[4]` equals `a[5]`, `le` equals `n`, `l` equals 0, `r` equals 0, `st` equals `n`, `end` equals `n - 1`, `ans` equals `n - max(n, n - 1)`, `_` equals 2, stdin contains `t - 3` inputs, input() must be greater than 0, and the maximum length of the subarray that can be obtained by removing at most one element from the list `a` such that the remaining elements are equal is not printed. Additionally, if the first and last elements of the list `a` are equal, then the first and last elements of the list `a` are equal, and the value of `ans` which is equal to `n - n` is printed. The current value of `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`.**
