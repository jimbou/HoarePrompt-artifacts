Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers, le is equal to n, l is equal to 0, r is equal to n - 1, st is equal to 1, end is equal to 1, ans is equal to n - (n + n), _ is 2, stdin contains t - 3 inputs, input() must be greater than 0, and the maximum length of the subarray that can be obtained by removing at most one element from the list a such that the remaining elements are equal is not printed. Additionally, if the first and last elements of the list a are equal, then the first and last elements of the list a are equal, and the value of ans which is equal to -n is printed**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `n` is updated to an integer greater than 1, which is obtained from the first input. The list `a` now contains `n` integers, which are obtained from the second input. The length of the list `a` is stored in the variable `le`, which is equal to `n`. The variables `l` and `r` are initialized to 0 and `n - 1`, respectively. The variables `st` and `end` are initialized to 1. The value of `ans` remains the same, which is equal to `n - (n + n)`. The value of `_` remains the same, which is 2. The stdin now contains `t - 3` inputs. The input() function must be greater than 0. The maximum length of the subarray that can be obtained by removing at most one element from the list `a` such that the remaining elements are equal is not printed. Additionally, if the first and last elements of the list `a` are equal, then the first and last elements of the list `a` are equal, and the value of `ans` which is equal to `-n` is printed.
