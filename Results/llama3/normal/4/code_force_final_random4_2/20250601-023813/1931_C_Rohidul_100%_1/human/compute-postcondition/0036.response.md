Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers where the first n elements are equal and a has at least n elements, le is equal to n, l is less than n - 2, r is greater than n - 2, st is equal to n, end is equal to 4, ans is not assigned a value, _ is 1, stdin contains t - 3 inputs, input() must be greater than 0, and the maximum length of the subarray that can be obtained by removing at most one element from the list a such that the remaining elements are equal is not printed.**

In this output state, the value of `r` has been decremented by 1, making it greater than `n - 2`, and the value of `end` has been incremented by 1, making it equal to 4. All other variables remain unchanged, retaining their initial values and properties.
