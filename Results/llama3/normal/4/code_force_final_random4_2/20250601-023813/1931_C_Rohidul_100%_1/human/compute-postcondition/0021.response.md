The code prints the value of `ans`, which is the maximum length of the subarray that can be obtained by removing at most one element from the list `a` such that the remaining elements are equal.

Since the exact value of `ans` depends on the values of `le`, `l`, `r`, `st`, `end`, and the first and last elements of `a`, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans` without knowing the specific input.

However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `ans`.

Output: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `le` is equal to `n`, `l` is equal to `r`, `st` is equal to `l + 1`, `end` is equal to the number of equal elements at the end of the list, `ans` is equal to `max(0, le - (st + end))` if the first and last elements of `a` are equal, otherwise `ans` is equal to `le - max(l + 1, end)`, `_` is 0, stdin contains `t - 1` inputs, input() must be greater than 0, and the maximum length of the subarray that can be obtained by removing at most one element from the list `a` such that the remaining elements are equal is printed**
