Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first and last elements are equal, `le` is equal to `n`, `l` is equal to `r`, `st` is equal to `l + 1`, `end` is equal to the number of equal elements at the end of the list, `ans` is equal to `max(0, le - (st + end))`, `_` is 0, stdin contains `t - 1` inputs, input() must be greater than 0.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to `max(0, le - (st + end))`, which means it will be the maximum of 0 and the difference between `le` and the sum of `st` and `end`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains `t - 1` inputs, with the constraint that input() must be greater than 0.
