Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers where a[0] equals a[1] and a[2] equals a[3], le is equal to n, l is equal to 3, r must be greater than 2, st is equal to 4, end is equal to 1, ans is equal to n - (n + n), _ is 2, stdin contains t - 3 inputs, input() must be greater than 0, and the maximum length of the subarray that can be obtained by removing at most one element from the list a such that the remaining elements are equal is not printed.**

In this output state, the values of `l` and `st` have been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` still contains `n` integers with the specified properties, and the other variables maintain their initial values. The stdin still contains `t - 3` inputs, and the maximum length of the subarray that can be obtained by removing at most one element from the list `a` such that the remaining elements are equal is not printed.
