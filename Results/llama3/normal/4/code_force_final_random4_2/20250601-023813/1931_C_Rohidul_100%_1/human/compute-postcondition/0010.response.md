Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first input, a is a list of n integers with at least two equal elements, le is equal to n, l is less than r, st is equal to l + 1, end is 2, stdin contains t - 1 inputs, _ is 0, input() must be greater than 0, r is 1 less than its original value**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `a`, `le`, `l`, `st`, `stdin`, `_`, and the constraint on `input()` remain unchanged. The value of `end` is incremented by 1, making it 2. The value of `r` is decremented by 1, making it 1 less than its original value.
