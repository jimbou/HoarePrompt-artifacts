Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, consider the input:

8
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

The program will output 7, but the correct answer is 8. The program only checks for the longest sequence of equal elements at the beginning and end of the array, but it does not consider the case where the longest sequence is in the middle of the array.

The program assumes that the longest sequence of equal elements is either at the beginning or at the end of the array, which is not always true. It does not consider the case where the longest sequence is in the middle of the array, and therefore it does not work correctly for all potential cases.

A correct solution would need to find the longest sequence of equal elements in the entire array, not just at the beginning and end.
