Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first `n` elements are equal, `le` is equal to `n`, `l` is equal to 0, `r` is equal to 0, `st` is equal to `n`, `end` is equal to `n`, `ans` is equal to `n - (n + n)`, `_` is 1, stdin contains t - 3 inputs, input() must be greater than 0, and the maximum length of the subarray that can be obtained by removing at most one element from the list `a` such that the remaining elements are equal is not printed. Additionally, the first and last elements of the list `a` are equal.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated to `n - (n + n)`, which simplifies to `-n`. All other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` still contains `n` equal integers, and the first and last elements are still equal. The input buffer still contains `t - 3` inputs, and the input values must be greater than 0. The maximum length of the subarray that can be obtained by removing at most one element from the list `a` such that the remaining elements are equal is still not printed.
