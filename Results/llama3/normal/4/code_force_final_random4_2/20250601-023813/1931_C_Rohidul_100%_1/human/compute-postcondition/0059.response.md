Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers where a[0] equals a[1], a[2] equals a[3], a[4] equals a[5], le equals n, l equals 0, r equals 0, st equals n, end equals n - 1, ans equals n - (n + n), _ equals 2, stdin contains t - 3 inputs, input() must be greater than 0, and the maximum length of the subarray that can be obtained by removing at most one element from the list a such that the remaining elements are equal is not printed. Additionally, if the first and last elements of the list a are equal, then the first and last elements of the list a are equal, and the value of ans which is equal to -n is printed.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variables `l` and `r` have reached 0, indicating that the loop has iterated over the entire list `a`. The variable `end` has reached `n - 1`, which is the last index of the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values.
