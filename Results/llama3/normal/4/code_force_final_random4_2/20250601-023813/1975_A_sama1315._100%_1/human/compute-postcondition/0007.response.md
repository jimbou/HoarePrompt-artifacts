Output State: **data is a list of strings where the first element is a positive integer t, followed by t blocks of input data, idx is t*(n+1)+1, results is a list containing t elements which are the result of func_1(a) for t different values of a, a is a list of n positive integers, t is 0, stdin is empty, _ is t-1, n is a positive integer, result is the result of func_1(a)**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a state where the loop has finished executing, and the results of all the iterations are stored in the `results` list. The `idx` variable has moved to the end of the `data` list, and the `t` variable has been decremented to 0, indicating that the loop has finished. The `a` variable still holds the last list of `n` positive integers processed by the loop, and the `result` variable holds the result of the last call to `func_1(a)`. The `stdin` variable remains empty, and the `_` variable has been incremented to `t-1`, indicating the number of iterations that have been executed.
