The code reads the entire input from stdin and splits it into a list of strings, where the first element is a positive integer t, representing the number of blocks of input data. Each block consists of a positive integer n followed by n positive integers. The code then initializes an empty list results and sets the index idx to 0. It then reads the value of t from the first element of the data list and increments the index idx by 1.

Output State: **data is a list of strings where the first element is a positive integer t, followed by t blocks of input data. Each block consists of a positive integer n followed by n positive integers, idx is 1, t is a positive integer, results is an empty list, stdin is empty.**
