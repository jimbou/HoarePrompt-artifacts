Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether an array can become sorted in non-decreasing order after performing a specific operation. The operation involves splitting the array into two parts and swapping them.

Function 1 (`func_1`) takes an array `a` as input and checks if it can be sorted in non-decreasing order after performing the operation. It first creates a sorted version of the array (`sorted_a`) and then concatenates the original array with itself (`concatenated_a`). It then checks if any substring of `concatenated_a` with the same length as `sorted_a` is equal to `sorted_a`. If such a substring is found, it returns 'Yes', indicating that the array can be sorted. If no such substring is found after checking all possible substrings, it returns 'No'.

Function 2 (`func_2`) is a wrapper function that reads input from the standard input, calls `func_1` for each test case, and prints the results.

The program's logic is correct. It correctly implements the operation described in the problem and checks all possible substrings of the concatenated array to determine if the array can be sorted.

However, there is a minor issue with the program. In Function 2, the input is read using `sys.stdin.read()`, which reads the entire input into a string. This can be inefficient for large inputs. A better approach would be to use `sys.stdin.readline()` to read the input line by line.

Despite this minor issue, the program's logic is correct, and it should produce the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
