Output State: **`a` is a list of positive integers, `n` is the number of elements in `a`, `sorted_a` is a sorted list of positive integers containing the same elements as `a`, `concatenated_a` is a list of positive integers containing two copies of the elements in `a`, `i` is equal to `n`. If the sublist of `concatenated_a` from index `i - len(sorted_a)` to `i` is equal to `sorted_a`, the program returns the string 'Yes'. Otherwise, the program returns None.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to the number of elements in the list `a`. If the sublist of `concatenated_a` from the index `i - len(sorted_a)` to `i` is equal to `sorted_a`, the program will return the string 'Yes'. Otherwise, the program will return None.
