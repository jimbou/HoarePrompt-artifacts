Reasoning: 

The problem requires determining whether a given array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by splitting it into two parts and swapping them. The provided functions aim to solve this problem.

Function 1 (`func_1`) checks if a sorted version of the input array can be found as a contiguous sublist within a concatenated version of the original array. This approach is correct because if a sorted version of the array can be found as a contiguous sublist, it means that the array can be sorted by splitting it into two parts and swapping them.

Function 2 (`func_2`) reads input from stdin, processes it into blocks of integers, applies the `func_1` function to each block, and prints the results. This function is a wrapper around `func_1` and does not affect the correctness of the solution.

Since `func_1` correctly solves the problem and `func_2` is a correct wrapper around `func_1`, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
