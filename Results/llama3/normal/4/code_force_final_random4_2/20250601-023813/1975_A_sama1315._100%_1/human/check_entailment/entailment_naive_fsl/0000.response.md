Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to check if the array can become non-decreasing after performing the operation any number of times. The function `func_1` checks if the array can be sorted by concatenating it with itself and checking if the sorted array is a substring of the concatenated array. This is a correct approach because if the array can be sorted by swapping the prefix and suffix, then the sorted array must be a substring of the concatenated array.

The function `func_2` reads the input data and calls `func_1` for each test case, which is also correct.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The program correctly handles all possible inputs and edge cases, including arrays of length 2, arrays with duplicate elements, and arrays that are already sorted.

Therefore, the program is correct and the answer is **True**.
