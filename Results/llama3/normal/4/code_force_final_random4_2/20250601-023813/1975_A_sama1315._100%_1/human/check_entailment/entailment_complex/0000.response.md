Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to check if a given array can be sorted in non-decreasing order after performing the specified operation any number of times. The program reads input from stdin, processes it into blocks of integers, applies the func_1 function to each block, and prints the results. The func_1 function checks if a sorted version of a given list of positive integers can be found as a contiguous sublist within a concatenated version of the original list, which is the key insight to solve this problem. It returns 'Yes' if such a sublist is found, and 'No' otherwise.

Correctness: **True**
