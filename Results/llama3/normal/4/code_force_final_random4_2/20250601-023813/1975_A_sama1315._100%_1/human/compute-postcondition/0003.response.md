To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only objects in the loop head are `_` and `t`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, and `t` is a positive integer greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `t` needs to remain greater than 0.

State: **`data` is a list of strings where the first element is a positive integer t, followed by t blocks of input data, `idx` is n+2, `results` is a list containing one element which is the result of func_1(a), `a` is a list of n positive integers, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `stdin` is empty, `_` is 1**
