Output State: **data is a list of strings where the first element is a positive integer t, followed by t blocks of input data, idx is n+2+n, results is a list containing two elements which are the result of func_1(a) for two different values of a, a is a list of n positive integers, t is a positive integer greater than 1, stdin is empty, _ is 1, n is a positive integer, result is the result of func_1(a)**

The code block executes as follows:

1. The first line assigns the value of the integer at index `idx` in the `data` list to `n`. Since `idx` is initially `n+2`, this means that `n` is assigned the value of the integer at index `n+2` in the `data` list.

2. The second line increments `idx` by 1, so `idx` becomes `n+3`.

3. The third line assigns a list of `n` integers from the `data` list, starting from index `idx`, to `a`. Since `idx` is now `n+3`, this means that `a` is assigned a list of `n` integers from the `data` list, starting from index `n+3`.

4. The fourth line increments `idx` by `n`, so `idx` becomes `n+3+n`.

5. The fifth line assigns the result of calling the function `func_1` with the list `a` as an argument to the variable `result`.

6. The sixth line appends the value of `result` to the `results` list.

After the code block executes, the final state is as follows:

* `data` is still a list of strings where the first element is a positive integer `t`, followed by `t` blocks of input data.
* `idx` is now `n+2+n`.
* `results` is a list containing two elements, which are the result of calling `func_1` with two different values of `a`.
* `a` is a list of `n` positive integers.
* `t` is still a positive integer greater than 1.
* `stdin` is still empty.
* `_` is still 1.
* `n` is a positive integer.
* `result` is the result of calling `func_1` with the list `a` as an argument.
