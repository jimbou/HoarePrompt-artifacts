The `print('\n'.join(results))` statement will print the elements of the `results` list, separated by newline characters.

Since `results` is a list containing `t` elements, where `t` is 0, the list is empty.

Therefore, the output will be an empty string, with no newline characters or any other characters.

Output: **(empty string)**
