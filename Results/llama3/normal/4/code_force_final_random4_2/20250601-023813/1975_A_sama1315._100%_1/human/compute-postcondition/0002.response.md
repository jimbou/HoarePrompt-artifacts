The code snippet processes the input data stored in the `data` list. The first line extracts the value of `n` from the `data` list at the current index `idx`, which is 1. Since `data` is a list of strings where the first element is a positive integer `t`, followed by `t` blocks of input data, the value of `n` is a positive integer.

The second line increments the `idx` by 1, so it now points to the next element in the `data` list.

The third line extracts `n` positive integers from the `data` list starting from the current `idx` and stores them in the list `a`. The `idx` is then incremented by `n` to point to the next block of input data.

The fourth line calls the function `func_1` with the list `a` as an argument and assigns the result to the variable `result`.

The fifth line appends the `result` to the `results` list.

After executing the entire code block, the `data` list remains unchanged, but the `idx` has been incremented by `n+1` to point to the next block of input data. The `results` list now contains one element, which is the result of calling `func_1` with the list `a`. The `a` list is a list of `n` positive integers, and the `result` variable holds the result of the function call.

Output State: **data is a list of strings where the first element is a positive integer t, followed by t blocks of input data, idx is n+2, results is a list containing one element which is the result of func_1(a), a is a list of n positive integers, t is a positive integer greater than 0, stdin is empty, _ is 0**
