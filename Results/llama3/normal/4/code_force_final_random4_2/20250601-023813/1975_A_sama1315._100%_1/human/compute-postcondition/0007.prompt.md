Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: data is a list of strings where the first element is a positive integer t, followed by t blocks of input data. Each block consists of a positive integer n followed by n positive integers, idx is 1, t is a positive integer, results is an empty list, stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
    idx += n
    result = func_1(a)
    results.append(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: data is a list of strings where the first element is a positive integer t, followed by t blocks of input data, idx is n+2, results is a list containing one element which is the result of func_1(a), a is a list of n positive integers, t is a positive integer greater than 0, stdin is empty, _ is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: data is a list of strings where the first element is a positive integer t, followed by t blocks of input data, idx is n+2+n, results is a list containing two elements which are the result of func_1(a) for two different values of a, a is a list of n positive integers, t is a positive integer greater than 1, stdin is empty, _ is 1, n is a positive integer, result is the result of func_1(a)

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: data is a list of strings where the first element is a positive integer t, followed by t blocks of input data, idx is n+3+n, results is a list containing three elements which are the result of func_1(a) for three different values of a, a is a list of n positive integers, t is a positive integer greater than 0, stdin is empty, _ is 2, n is a positive integer, result is the result of func_1(a)




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
