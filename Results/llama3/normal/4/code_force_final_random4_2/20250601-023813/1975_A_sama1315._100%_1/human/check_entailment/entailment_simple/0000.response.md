Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether a given array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by splitting it into two parts and swapping them. The program uses a helper function `func_1` to check if the array can be sorted.

In `func_1`, the program first creates a sorted version of the input array `a` and a concatenated version of `a` with itself. It then checks if any sublist of the concatenated array is equal to the sorted array. If such a sublist is found, the function returns 'Yes', indicating that the array can be sorted. If no such sublist is found after checking all possible sublists, the function returns 'No'.

The main function `func_2` reads input from stdin, parses it into test cases, and applies `func_1` to each test case. It then prints the results.

The program's logic is correct. It correctly checks all possible sublists of the concatenated array to see if any of them match the sorted array. If a match is found, it means that the array can be sorted by swapping two parts, and the program returns 'Yes'. If no match is found, it means that the array cannot be sorted, and the program returns 'No'.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
