The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is at least 1, `_` is 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time `_` is 1 and `t` is at least 1.
State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 1, a, b, and c are integers (0 <= a <= b <= c <= 30), x is an integer equal to the sum of a, b, and c divided by 2, y is an integer equal to the sum of a and b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains three integers p_1, p_2 and p_3 (0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30) â€” the scores of the three players, sorted non-decreasingly.**
