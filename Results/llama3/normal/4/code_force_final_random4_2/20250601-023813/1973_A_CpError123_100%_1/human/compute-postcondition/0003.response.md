Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers (0 <= a <= b <= c <= 30), stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains three integers p_1, p_2 and p_3 (0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30) â€” the scores of the three players, sorted non-decreasingly. The current value of the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is an odd number.**
