Output State: **t is at least 1, _ is 1, a, b, and c are integers (0 <= a <= b <= c <= 30) and are equal to p_1, p_2 and p_3 respectively, x is an integer equal to the sum of a, b, and c divided by 2, y is an integer equal to the sum of a and b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains three integers p_1, p_2 and p_3 (0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30) â€” the scores of the three players, sorted non-decreasingly.**

The code snippet provided does not modify the values of `t`, `_`, `a`, `b`, `c`, or the contents of `stdin`. The variables `x` and `y` are reassigned new values based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. The value of `x` becomes the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` divided by 2, and the value of `y` becomes the sum of `a` and `b`.
