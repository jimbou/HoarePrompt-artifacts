Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers (0 <= a <= b <= c <= 30) and are equal to `p_1`, `p_2` and `p_3` respectively, `x` is an integer equal to the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` divided by 2, `y` is an integer equal to the sum of `a` and `b`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, each test case contains three integers `p_1`, `p_2` and `p_3` (0 <= `p_1` <= `p_2` <= `p_3` <= 30) â€” the scores of the three players, sorted non-decreasingly, the minimum of `x` and `y` is printed, where `x` is the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` divided by 2 and `y` is the sum of `a` and `b`, and -1 is printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. The values of the variables `t`, `_`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `x`, and `y` remain the same, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus three. The minimum of `x` and `y` is still printed, and -1 is still printed. The only change is that we move on to the next iteration of the loop.
