Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers (0 <= a <= b <= c <= 30), stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains three integers p_1, p_2 and p_3 (0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30) â€” the scores of the three players, sorted non-decreasingly.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values of the three integers from the input, which are the scores of the three players, sorted non-decreasingly. The stdin now contains one less test case, as one test case has been read and processed.
