Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers (0 <= `a` <= `b` <= `c` <= 30) and are equal to `p_1`, `p_2` and `p_3` respectively, `x` is an integer equal to the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` divided by 2, `y` is an integer equal to the sum of `a` and `b`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains three integers `p_1`, `p_2` and `p_3` (0 <= `p_1` <= `p_2` <= `p_3` <= 30) â€” the scores of the three players, sorted non-decreasingly.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to the scores of the three players in the current test case, while the values of `t`, `_`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. The number of test cases in the standard input is reduced by one.
