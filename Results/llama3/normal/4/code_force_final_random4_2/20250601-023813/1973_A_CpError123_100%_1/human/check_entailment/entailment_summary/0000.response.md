Reasoning:

The program is correct. Here's why:

*   The program first checks if the sum of the scores is odd. If it is, the program prints -1, because the sum of the scores must be even (each game contributes 2 points to the total sum of scores).
*   If the sum of the scores is even, the program calculates the minimum of two values: `x = (a + b + c) // 2` and `y = a + b`. The value `x` represents the maximum possible number of draws (because each draw contributes 1 point to the total sum of scores, and there are `x` points in total). The value `y` represents the maximum possible number of points that the first two players could have scored (because they can score at most `y` points in total).
*   The program then prints the minimum of `x` and `y`. This is because the maximum possible number of draws cannot exceed the maximum possible number of points that the first two players could have scored.

Correctness: **True**
