Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum number of draws that could have happened given the scores of three players after all games were played. The scores are guaranteed to be non-negative and in non-decreasing order.

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program first checks if the sum of the scores is odd. If it is, the program prints -1 and continues to the next test case. This is because the sum of the scores must be even, as each game can result in either a win (2 points), a loss (0 points), or a draw (1 point for each player). If the sum is odd, it's impossible to achieve the given scores.

2. If the sum of the scores is even, the program calculates the maximum possible number of draws. This is done by dividing the sum of the scores by 2, which gives the total number of points that can be distributed among the players. The program then calculates the sum of the scores of the first two players (a and b).

3. The program prints the minimum of the total number of points (x) and the sum of the scores of the first two players (y). This is because the maximum number of draws cannot exceed the total number of points, and it also cannot exceed the sum of the scores of the first two players, as they can only play against each other.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and provides the maximum number of draws that could have happened given the scores of the three players.

Correctness: **True**
