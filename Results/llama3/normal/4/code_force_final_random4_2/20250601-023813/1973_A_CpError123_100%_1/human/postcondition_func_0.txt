This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains three integers representing the scores of three players. It calculates the minimum of two values: the sum of the scores divided by 2, and the sum of the scores of the first two players. If the sum of the scores is odd, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the calculated minimum value. The function processes all test cases and leaves the standard input empty.
