Postcondition: ***t is at least 2, _ is 2, a, b, and c are integers (0 <= a <= b <= c <= 30) and are equal to p_1, p_2 and p_3 respectively, x is an integer equal to the sum of a, b, and c divided by 2, y is an integer equal to the sum of a and b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, each test case contains three integers p_1, p_2 and p_3 (0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30) â€” the scores of the three players, sorted non-decreasingly. If the sum of a, b, and c is odd, -1 is printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the minimum of x and y is printed.***
