Output State: **t is 0, _ is t, a, b, and c are integers (0 <= a <= b <= c <= 30) and are equal to p_1, p_2 and p_3 respectively, x is an integer equal to the sum of a, b, and c divided by 2, y is an integer equal to the sum of a and b, stdin is empty, and the minimum of x and y is printed, where x is the sum of a, b, and c divided by 2 and y is the sum of a and b.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable t will be 0, the variable _ will be equal to the initial value of t, the variables a, b, and c will be equal to the last set of input values, the variables x and y will be calculated based on these last input values, and the minimum of x and y will be printed. The stdin will be empty, indicating that all input test cases have been processed.
