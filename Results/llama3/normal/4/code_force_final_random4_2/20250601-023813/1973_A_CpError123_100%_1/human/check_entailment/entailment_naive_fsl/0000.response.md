Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle all cases. For example, when the input is 1 1 10, the program outputs 2, but the correct output should be -1. This is because it is impossible for the three players to have scores of 1, 1, and 10, as the total number of points is 12, which is not a multiple of 2 (the number of points awarded per game).

The program assumes that the maximum number of draws is the minimum of the total number of points divided by 2 and the sum of the scores of the first two players. However, this assumption is not always correct. In the case of 1 1 10, the program's assumption leads to an incorrect result.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider all possible combinations of wins, losses, and draws that could result in the given scores, and then find the maximum number of draws among these combinations. The program does not do this, and therefore it is incorrect.
