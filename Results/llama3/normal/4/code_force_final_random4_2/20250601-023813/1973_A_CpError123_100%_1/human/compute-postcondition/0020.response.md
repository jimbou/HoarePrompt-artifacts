The only variable in the loop head is variable  _ and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than t, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 1, t is at least 1. For the loop to execute again _ is increased by 1 so _ is 2 and for the loop to execute again t must be greater than 2.
State: **t is at least 2, _ is 2, a, b, and c are integers (0 <= a <= b <= c <= 30) and are equal to p_1, p_2 and p_3 respectively, x is an integer equal to the sum of a, b, and c divided by 2, y is an integer equal to the sum of a and b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, each test case contains three integers p_1, p_2 and p_3 (0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30) â€” the scores of the three players, sorted non-decreasingly, and the minimum of x and y is printed, where x is the sum of a, b, and c divided by 2 and y is the sum of a and b.**
