Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers (0 <= `a` <= `b` <= `c` <= 30) and are equal to `p_1`, `p_2` and `p_3` respectively, `x` is an integer equal to the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` divided by 2, `y` is an integer equal to the sum of `a` and `b`, we skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next one, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains three integers `p_1`, `p_2` and `p_3` (0 <= `p_1` <= `p_2` <= `p_3` <= 30) â€” the scores of the three players, sorted non-decreasingly, and -1 is printed**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next one. The values of the variables `t`, `_`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `x`, and `y` remain the same, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one, each with three integers representing the scores of the three players.
