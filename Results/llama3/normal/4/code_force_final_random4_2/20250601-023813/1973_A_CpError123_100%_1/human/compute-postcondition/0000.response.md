The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the stdin and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state contains multiple test cases, the first integer is accepted and assigned to `t`. The remaining test cases are still in the stdin.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains three integers p_1, p_2 and p_3 (0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30) â€” the scores of the three players, sorted non-decreasingly.**
