The code prints the minimum value between `x` and `y`. 

`x` is an integer equal to the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` divided by 2. Since `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers (0 <= a <= b <= c <= 30) and are equal to `p_1`, `p_2` and `p_3` respectively, `x` is the average of the three scores.

`y` is an integer equal to the sum of `a` and `b`. Since `a` and `b` are integers (0 <= a <= b <= 30) and are equal to `p_1` and `p_2` respectively, `y` is the sum of the first two scores.

Since `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers (0 <= a <= b <= c <= 30), the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is at most 90, and the average `x` is at most 45. The sum of `a` and `b` is at most 60, so `y` is at most 60.

Since `x` is the average of the three scores and `y` is the sum of the first two scores, `x` is less than or equal to `y`. Therefore, the minimum value between `x` and `y` is `x`.

Output: **the average of the three scores (which is the value of x)**
