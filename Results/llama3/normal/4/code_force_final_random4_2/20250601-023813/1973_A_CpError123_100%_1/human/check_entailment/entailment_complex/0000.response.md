Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly handles the case where the sum of the scores is odd. In this case, it prints -1, which is correct because the sum of the scores must be even (each game contributes 2 points to the total sum, and each draw contributes 1 point to the total sum, which is still even).

2.  The program correctly calculates the maximum number of draws that could have happened. The maximum number of draws is the minimum of two values: the sum of the scores divided by 2 (x), and the sum of the scores of the first two players (y).

    *   The sum of the scores divided by 2 (x) represents the maximum number of draws that could have happened if all games were draws. This is because each draw contributes 1 point to the total sum, so the maximum number of draws is the total sum divided by 2.

    *   The sum of the scores of the first two players (y) represents the maximum number of draws that could have happened between the first two players. This is because the first two players can play at most y games against each other, and each game can result in at most 1 draw.

    *   The minimum of x and y represents the maximum number of draws that could have happened overall. This is because the maximum number of draws that could have happened is limited by both the total sum of the scores and the sum of the scores of the first two players.

3.  The program correctly handles all possible inputs. The problem statement guarantees that the input scores are non-negative and that the first score is less than or equal to the second score, which is less than or equal to the third score. The program does not make any assumptions about the input scores beyond these guarantees.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
