Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers (0 <= a <= b <= c <= 30), stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains three integers p_1, p_2 and p_3 (0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30) â€” the scores of the three players, sorted non-decreasingly. The current value of the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is an odd number, and we skip the current iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip the current iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. The values of `t`, `_`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one. The sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is still an odd number, and -1 is still printed.
