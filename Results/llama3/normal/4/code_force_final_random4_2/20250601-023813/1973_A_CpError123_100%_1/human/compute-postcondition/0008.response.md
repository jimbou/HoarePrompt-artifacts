Output State: **t is at least 1, _ is 0, a, b, and c are integers (0 <= a <= b <= c <= 30), x is an integer equal to the sum of a, b, and c divided by 2, y is an integer equal to the sum of a and b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains three integers p_1, p_2 and p_3 (0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30) â€” the scores of the three players, sorted non-decreasingly. If the sum of a, b, and c is an odd number, the current iteration of the loop is skipped. Otherwise, the program continues to the next iteration.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are still integers between 0 and 30, inclusive, and their order is preserved. The new variables `x` and `y` are introduced, where `x` is the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` divided by 2, and `y` is the sum of `a` and `b`. The state of `stdin` is also updated, as one test case has been processed. The condition regarding the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` being odd or even is still applicable, determining whether the current iteration of the loop is skipped or continued.
