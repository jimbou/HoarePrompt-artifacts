The only objects in the loop head are variables  i and costs, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the costs.  If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, costs has 2 elements, i is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the i is the third element in the list.
State: **n is 0, k is a positive integer, costs is a list containing three elements: n - k + 1, 1 and the third element, h is n // (n - k + 1) + n, i is the third element in the list**
