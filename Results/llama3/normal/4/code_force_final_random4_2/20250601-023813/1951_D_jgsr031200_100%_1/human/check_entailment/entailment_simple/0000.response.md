Reasoning: The given program is correct. It correctly handles the cases where n equals k, n is less than k, and n is greater than or equal to k. In the case where n is greater than or equal to k, it calculates the costs for the two stalls and checks if the total number of jewels bought is greater than or equal to k. If it is, it prints 'YES' and the costs for the two stalls. If not, it prints 'NO'. The program also correctly handles the case where n equals k by printing 'YES' and the cost for one stall.

Correctness: **True**
