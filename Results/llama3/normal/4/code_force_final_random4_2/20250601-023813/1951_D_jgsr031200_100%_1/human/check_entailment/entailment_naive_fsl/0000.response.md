Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when n = 10 and k = 3, the program will output "YES" and print the costs as [8, 1], but this is incorrect because Alice will only buy 2 jewels at the first stall (costing 8 coins each) and will not have enough coins to buy any jewels at the second stall.

The issue with the program is that it assumes that the cost of the first stall will always be n - k + 1, which is not necessarily true. The correct approach would be to find the maximum cost of the first stall such that Alice can buy at least k jewels. This can be done by iterating over all possible costs from 1 to n and checking if Alice can buy at least k jewels. If she can, then the current cost is the maximum cost of the first stall.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n, k):
    if n == k:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(1)
        return
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
        return
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        curr = n // i
        if curr >= k:
            print('YES')
            print(2)
            print(i, 1)
            return
    print('NO')
```

This program iterates over all possible costs from 1 to n and checks if Alice can buy at least k jewels. If she can, then it prints "YES" and the costs of the two stalls. If it cannot find any cost that allows Alice to buy at least k jewels, then it prints "NO".
