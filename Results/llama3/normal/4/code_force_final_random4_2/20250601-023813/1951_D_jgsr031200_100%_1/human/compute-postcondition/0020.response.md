Output State: **n is 0, k is a positive integer, costs is a list containing three elements: n - k + 1, 1 and the third element, h is n // (n - k + 1) + n + curr, i is the third element in the list, curr is n // i**

The code snippet modifies the values of `h`, `n`, and introduces a new variable `curr`. The initial value of `n` is 0, `k` is a positive integer, and `costs` is a list containing three elements: `n - k + 1`, 1, and the third element. The initial value of `h` is `n // (n - k + 1) + n`, and `i` is the third element in the list.

The first line assigns the value of `n // i` to `curr`. Since `n` is 0, `curr` becomes 0.

The second line increments `h` by the value of `curr`, which is 0, so `h` remains unchanged.

The third line decrements `n` by the product of `i` and `curr`, which is 0, so `n` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the final output state is:

* `n` is still 0
* `k` is still a positive integer
* `costs` is still a list containing three elements: `n - k + 1`, 1, and the third element
* `h` is still `n // (n - k + 1) + n`, but now it's also equal to `n // (n - k + 1) + n + curr`
* `i` is still the third element in the list
* `curr` is now `n // i`, which is 0
