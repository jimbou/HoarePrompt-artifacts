Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly determines whether it is possible to achieve a target value `k` using a combination of two costs, `n - k + 1` and `1`, given an initial value `n`. 

The program first checks if `n` is equal to `k`, in which case it prints 'YES' and the cost 1. If `n` is less than `k`, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible to achieve `k` with a smaller `n`. 

Otherwise, it calculates the costs `n - k + 1` and `1`, and checks if the total number of items that can be bought with these costs is less than `k`. If it is, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES', the number of operations required (2), and the costs used.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible cases. 

Correctness: **True**
