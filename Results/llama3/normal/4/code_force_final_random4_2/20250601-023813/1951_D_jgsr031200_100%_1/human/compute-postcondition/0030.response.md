The code prints the elements of the list `costs`. The list `costs` contains two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1`. Since `n` is 0, the first element of the list `costs` is `0 - k + 1` which simplifies to `-k + 1`. The second element of the list `costs` is `1`.

Output: **-k + 1, 1 (where k is a positive integer)**
