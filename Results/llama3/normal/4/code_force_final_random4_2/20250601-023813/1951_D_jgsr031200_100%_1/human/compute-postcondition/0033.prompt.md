You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers.
    if (n == k) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        return
        #The program returns None, n and k are still positive integers and equal to each other, 'YES' has been printed, and the number 1 has been printed twice.
    #State: *n and k are positive integers, and n is not equal to k
    if (n < k) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
        return
        #The program returns nothing, as the return statement is empty. The values of n and k remain unchanged, with n being a positive integer less than k, and 'NO' is still being printed.
    #State: *n and k are positive integers, n is not equal to k, and n is larger than or equal to k
    costs = [n - k + 1, 1]
    h = 0
    for i in costs:
        curr = n // i
        
        h += curr
        
        n -= i * curr
        
    #State: n is 0, k is a positive integer, costs is a list containing two elements: n - k + 1 and 1, h is n // (n - k + 1) + n + curr, i is the last element in the list, curr is n // i
    if (h < k) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    else :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
        print(*costs)
        #This is printed: -k + 1, 1 (where k is a positive integer)
    #State: *n is 0, k is a positive integer, costs is a list containing two elements: n - k + 1 and 1, h is n // (n - k + 1) + n + curr, i is the last element in the list, curr is n // i. If h is less than k, 'NO' is printed. If h is greater than or equal to k, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, and the list costs containing the elements: n - k + 1 and 1 is printed.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns None, n and k are still positive integers and equal to each other, 'YES' has been printed, and the number 1 has been printed twice.

Case_2: The program returns nothing, as the return statement is empty. The values of n and k remain unchanged, with n being a positive integer less than k, and 'NO' is still being printed.

Case_3: n is 0, k is a positive integer, costs is a list containing two elements: n - k + 1 and 1, h is n // (n - k + 1) + n + curr, i is the last element in the list, curr is n // i. The current value of h is less than k, and 'NO' is printed

Case_4: n is 0, k is a positive integer, costs is a list containing two elements: n - k + 1 and 1, h is n // (n - k + 1) + n + curr, i is the last element in the list, curr is n // i, and h is greater than or equal to k, and 'YES' is printed, and the number 2 is printed, and the list costs containing the elements: n - k + 1 and 1 is printed


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
