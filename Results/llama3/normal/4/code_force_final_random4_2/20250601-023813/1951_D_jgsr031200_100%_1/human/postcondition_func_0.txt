This function determines whether it is possible to achieve a target value `k` using a combination of two costs, `n - k + 1` and `1`, given an initial value `n`. It prints 'YES' if possible, along with the number of operations required (1 or 2) and the costs used, or 'NO' if not possible. The function modifies the input value `n` to 0 in the process and leaves the value of `k` unchanged.
