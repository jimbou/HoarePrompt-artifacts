To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the list `costs`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if the list `costs` has at least one element. Since `costs` already contains two elements, we can conclude that the loop will execute.

However, we need to adjust the state of `i` to reflect its initial value. Since `i` will take on the value of each element in `costs` during the loop, its initial value should be the first element of `costs`, which is `n - k + 1`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`n` is a positive integer larger than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `costs` is a list containing two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1`, `h` is `0`, `i` is `n - k + 1`**
