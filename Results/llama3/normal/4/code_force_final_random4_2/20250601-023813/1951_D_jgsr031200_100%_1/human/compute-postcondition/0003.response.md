Based on the initial state, the code will print the number 1.

The initial state states that n and k are positive integers, and the current value of n is equal to the current value of k. However, this information is not relevant to the print statement, which simply prints the number 1.

The fact that 'YES' is being printed is also not relevant to the print statement, as it is a separate statement that is not connected to the print statement.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be the number 1, regardless of the values of n and k.

Output: **1**
