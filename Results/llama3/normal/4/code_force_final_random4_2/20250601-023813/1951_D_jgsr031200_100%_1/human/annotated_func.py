        return
        #The program returns nothing, as the return statement is empty. The values of n and k remain unchanged, with n being a positive integer less than k, and 'NO' is still being printed.

    costs = [n - k + 1, 1]
    h = 0
    for i in costs:
        curr = n // i
        
        h += curr
        
        n -= i * curr
        
    #State: n is 0, k is a positive integer, costs is a list containing two elements: n - k + 1 and 1, h is n // (n - k + 1) + n + curr, i is the last element in the list, curr is n // i

    #State: *n is 0, k is a positive integer, costs is a list containing two elements: n - k + 1 and 1, h is n // (n - k + 1) + n + curr, i is the last element in the list, curr is n // i. If h is less than k, 'NO' is printed. If h is greater than or equal to k, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, and the list costs containing the elements: n - k + 1 and 1 is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines whether it is possible to achieve a target value `k` using a combination of two costs, `n - k + 1` and `1`, given an initial value `n`. It prints 'YES' if possible, along with the number of operations required (1 or 2) and the costs used, or 'NO' if not possible. The function modifies the input value `n` to 0 in the process and leaves the value of `k` unchanged.
