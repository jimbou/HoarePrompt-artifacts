The code snippet consists of three lines that modify the variables `curr`, `h`, and `n`. Here's the combined effect of all lines on the program:

The first line assigns the value of `n // i` to `curr`. Since `n` is a positive integer larger than or equal to `k`, and `i` is `n - k + 1`, `curr` becomes the integer division of `n` by `n - k + 1`.

The second line increments `h` by the value of `curr`. Since `h` is initially `0`, `h` becomes equal to `curr`.

The third line subtracts `i * curr` from `n`. Since `i` is `n - k + 1`, and `curr` is the integer division of `n` by `n - k + 1`, `n` becomes `n - (n - k + 1) * (n // (n - k + 1))`.

The variables `k` and `costs` are not modified by the code.

Output State: **n is a positive integer larger than or equal to k, k is a positive integer, costs is a list containing two elements: n - k + 1 and 1, h is n // (n - k + 1), i is n - k + 1**
