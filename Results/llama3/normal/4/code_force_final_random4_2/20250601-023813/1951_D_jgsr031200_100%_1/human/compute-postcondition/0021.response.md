Output State: **n is 0, k is a positive integer, costs is a list containing two elements: n - k + 1 and 1, h is n // (n - k + 1) + n + curr, i is the last element in the list, curr is n // i**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable n becomes 0, the variable k remains a positive integer, the list costs still contains two elements: n - k + 1 and 1, the variable h is the sum of the initial value of n divided by the first element in the list costs, the initial value of n, and the last value of curr, the variable i is the last element in the list costs, and the variable curr is the last value of n divided by the last element in the list costs.
