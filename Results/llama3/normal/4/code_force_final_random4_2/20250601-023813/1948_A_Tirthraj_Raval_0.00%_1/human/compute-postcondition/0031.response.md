The code appends two elements to the `pattern` list. The first line appends the character at index `i % 2` in the string `'AB'`. Since `i` is 1, `i % 2` equals 1, and the character at index 1 in `'AB'` is `'B'`. The second line appends the character at index `i % 2 ^ 1` in the string `'AB'`. Since `i` is 1, `i % 2 ^ 1` equals 0, and the character at index 0 in `'AB'` is `'A'`. 

Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, _ is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, pattern is ['A', 'B', 'B', 'A'], stdin contains t-4 integers, 'YES' is being printed, i is 1**
