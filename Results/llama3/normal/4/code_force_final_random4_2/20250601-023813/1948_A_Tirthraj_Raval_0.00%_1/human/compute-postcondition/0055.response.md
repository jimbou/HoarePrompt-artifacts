Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 47 inclusive, _ is t, n is an integer between 1 and 49 inclusive, stdin contains 0 integers n (1 <= n <= 50). If n is odd, 'NO' is printed. If n is even, 'YES' is printed, a string of 'A's and 'B's of length n is printed, and pattern is a list of 'A's and 'B's of length n, with i being n // 2.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be between 0 and 47 (inclusive), the loop counter `_` will be equal to `t`, and the variable `n` will be between 1 and 49 (inclusive). The standard input `stdin` will be empty, containing no more integers. If the last value of `n` was odd, the string 'NO' will have been printed. If the last value of `n` was even, the string 'YES' will have been printed, followed by a string of 'A's and 'B's of length `n`, and the list `pattern` will contain 'A's and 'B's of length `n`, with the index `i` being `n // 2`.
