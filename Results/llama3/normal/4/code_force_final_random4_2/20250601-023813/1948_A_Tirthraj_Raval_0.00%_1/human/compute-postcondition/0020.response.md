Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, stdin contains `t-1` integers `n` (1 <= n <= 50). If `n` is odd, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is even, 'YES' is printed, and a pattern of 'A's and 'B's, alternating between 'A' and 'B' with 'A' appearing first, is printed as a string of length `n`.***
