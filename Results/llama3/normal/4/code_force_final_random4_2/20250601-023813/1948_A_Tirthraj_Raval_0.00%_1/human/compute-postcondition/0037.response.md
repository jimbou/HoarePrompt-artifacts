Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, stdin contains `t-3` integers `n` (1 <= n <= 50). If `n` is odd, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is even, 'YES' is printed, a pattern of 'A's and 'B's of length `n` is created, and the pattern is printed as a string of 'A's and 'B's.***
