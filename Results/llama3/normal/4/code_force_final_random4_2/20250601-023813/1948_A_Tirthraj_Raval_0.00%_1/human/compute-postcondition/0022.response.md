Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, stdin contains `t-3` integers `n` (1 <= n <= 50).**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to the next integer input from stdin, which is between 1 and 50 inclusive. The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged. The stdin now contains `t-3` integers `n` (1 <= n <= 50), as one integer has been consumed by the input operation.
