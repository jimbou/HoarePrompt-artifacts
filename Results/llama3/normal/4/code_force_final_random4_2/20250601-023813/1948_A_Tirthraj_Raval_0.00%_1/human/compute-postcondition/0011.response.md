The code appends two elements to the `pattern` list. The first line appends 'A' if `i` is even (i.e., `i % 2` is 0) or 'B' if `i` is odd (i.e., `i % 2` is 1). The second line appends 'B' if `i` is even (i.e., `i % 2 ^ 1` is 1) or 'A' if `i` is odd (i.e., `i % 2 ^ 1` is 0).

Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, _ is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive and is even, 'YES' is printed, stdin contains t-1 integers n (1 <= n <= 50), pattern is a list containing two elements: 'A' and 'B' in either order, i is 0**
