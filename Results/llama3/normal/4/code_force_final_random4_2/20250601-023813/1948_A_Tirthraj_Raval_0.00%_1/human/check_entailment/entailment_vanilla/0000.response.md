Reasoning:

1. The problem statement requires building a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly n special characters, where a character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

2. The provided Python program defines a function `func()` that takes no arguments and reads input from the standard input.

3. The program first reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases.

4. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the number of special characters required in the string.

5. If `n` is odd, the program prints 'NO' because it is impossible to construct a string with an odd number of special characters.

6. If `n` is even, the program prints 'YES' and constructs a string by repeating the pattern 'AB' (or 'BA') `n // 2` times. This pattern ensures that each character has exactly one neighbor that is the same, thus making it special.

7. The constructed string is then printed.

8. The program repeats this process for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
