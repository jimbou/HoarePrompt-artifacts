Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, _ is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, pattern is ['A', 'B'], stdin contains t-3 integers, 'YES' is being printed, i is 0**

The code appends 'A' and 'B' to the pattern list in an alternating manner, starting with 'A' since i is 0. The pattern list now contains ['A', 'B']. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
