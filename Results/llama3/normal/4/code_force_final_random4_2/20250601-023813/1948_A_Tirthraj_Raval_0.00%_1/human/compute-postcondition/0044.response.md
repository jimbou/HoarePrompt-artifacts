Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 49 inclusive, `pattern` is an empty list, stdin contains `t-5` integers `n` (1 <= n <= 50), and 'YES' is being printed**

In this output state, the code has introduced a new variable `pattern` which is an empty list. The values of the other variables, `t`, `_`, and `n`, remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-5` integers `n`, and 'YES' is still being printed.
