The code prints a string formed by joining all elements in the `pattern` list without any separator. The `pattern` list contains `n` elements, alternating between 'A' and 'B' with 'A' appearing first. Since `n` is an even integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, the length of the `pattern` list is even.

Output: **A string of length n, consisting of alternating 'A's and 'B's, starting with 'A', where n is an even integer between 2 and 50 inclusive**
