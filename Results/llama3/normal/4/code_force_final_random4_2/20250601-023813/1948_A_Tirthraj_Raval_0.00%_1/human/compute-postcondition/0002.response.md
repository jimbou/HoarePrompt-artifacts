Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, stdin contains `t-1` integers `n` (1 <= n <= 50)**.

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The value of `_` also remains 0. The value of `n` is now an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, as it was assigned the value of the first integer input from stdin. The stdin now contains `t-1` integers `n`, as one integer has been consumed by the `input()` function.
