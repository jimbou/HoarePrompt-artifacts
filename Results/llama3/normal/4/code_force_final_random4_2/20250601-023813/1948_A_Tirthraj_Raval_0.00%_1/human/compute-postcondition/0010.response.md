To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. Since the loop condition is `n // 2`, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 2 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive and is even, 'YES' is printed, stdin contains `t-1` integers `n` (1 <= n <= 50), `pattern` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
