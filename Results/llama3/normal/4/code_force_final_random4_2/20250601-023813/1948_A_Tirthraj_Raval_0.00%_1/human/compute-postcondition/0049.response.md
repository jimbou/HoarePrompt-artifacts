The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n // 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 49 inclusive. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n // 2` must be greater than 2. This means that `n` must be greater than 4.
State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 5 and 49 inclusive, `pattern` is ['A', 'B', 'B', 'A'], `stdin` contains `t-6` integers, 'YES' is being printed, `i` is 2**
