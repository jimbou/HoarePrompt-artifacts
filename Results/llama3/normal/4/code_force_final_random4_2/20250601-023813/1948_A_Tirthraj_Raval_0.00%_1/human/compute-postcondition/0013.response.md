The code snippet appends two elements to the `pattern` list based on the value of `i`. Since `i` is 1, `i % 2` equals 1, and `i % 2 ^ 1` equals 0. Therefore, the first line appends 'B' to `pattern`, and the second line appends 'A' to `pattern`.

Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, _ is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive and is even, 'YES' is printed, stdin contains t-1 integers n (1 <= n <= 50), pattern is a list containing four elements: 'A', 'B', 'B', and 'A' in that order, i is 1**
