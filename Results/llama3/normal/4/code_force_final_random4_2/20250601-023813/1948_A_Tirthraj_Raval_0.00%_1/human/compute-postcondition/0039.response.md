Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 49 inclusive, stdin contains `t-5` integers `n` (1 <= n <= 50)**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to be an integer between 1 and 49 inclusive, because one integer `n` has been read from the stdin. The stdin now contains `t-5` integers `n`, because one integer `n` has been read and removed from the stdin. The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged.
