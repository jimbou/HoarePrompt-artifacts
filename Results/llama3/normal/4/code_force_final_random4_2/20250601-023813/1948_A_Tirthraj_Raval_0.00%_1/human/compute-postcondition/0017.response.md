Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, _ is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive and is even, 'YES' is printed, stdin contains t-1 integers n (1 <= n <= 50), pattern is a list containing n elements: 'A', 'B', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'A', ... (alternating between 'A' and 'B' with 'A' appearing first), i is n // 2 - 1**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for `t`, `_`, `n`, and the contents of `stdin` as in the initial state. The variable `pattern` will be a list of `n` elements, where `n` is an even integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, and the list will contain alternating 'A's and 'B's, starting with 'A'. The variable `i` will be equal to `n // 2 - 1`, which is the last index of the loop.
