Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when n is even but not a multiple of 4. In this case, the program will print a string with n/2 pairs of 'A' and 'B', but this string will not have exactly n special characters. For example, when n = 6, the program will print "AABBAA", which has 4 special characters, not 6.
