Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive, _ is 2, n is an integer between 1 and 49 inclusive, pattern is a list of 'A's and 'B's of length n, stdin contains t-5 integers, 'YES' is being printed, i is n // 2**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `t` remains unchanged, `_` remains 2, `n` remains unchanged, `pattern` is a list of 'A's and 'B's of length `n`, stdin contains `t-5` integers, 'YES' is being printed, and `i` is `n // 2`.
