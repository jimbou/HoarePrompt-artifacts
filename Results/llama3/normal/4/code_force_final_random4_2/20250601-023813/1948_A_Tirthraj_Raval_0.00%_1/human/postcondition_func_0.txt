This function reads a series of integers from standard input, where the first integer t represents the number of subsequent integers n. For each n, if n is odd, it prints 'NO'. If n is even, it prints 'YES' followed by a string of alternating 'A's and 'B's of length n. The function processes all t integers and then concludes, leaving the input stream empty.
