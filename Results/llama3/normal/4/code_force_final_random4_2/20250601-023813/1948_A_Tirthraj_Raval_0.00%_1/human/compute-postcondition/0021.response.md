The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, stdin contains `t-2` integers `n` (1 <= n <= 50). If `n` is odd, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is even, 'YES' is printed, and a pattern of 'A's and 'B's, alternating between 'A' and 'B' with 'A' appearing first, is printed as a string of length `n`.**
