Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `pattern` is an empty list, stdin contains `t-3` integers `n` (1 <= n <= 50), and 'YES' is being printed**

The code creates an empty list called `pattern`. The values of the other variables, `t`, `_`, and `n`, remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-3` integers `n` (1 <= n <= 50), and 'YES' is still being printed.
