The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, which ensures that the loop will execute, so it does not need to be adjusted. However, `_` is not defined before the loop starts, so it needs to be adjusted to be 0 (the first value in the range of `t`).
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `_` is 0, stdin contains `t` integers `n` (1 <= n <= 50)**
