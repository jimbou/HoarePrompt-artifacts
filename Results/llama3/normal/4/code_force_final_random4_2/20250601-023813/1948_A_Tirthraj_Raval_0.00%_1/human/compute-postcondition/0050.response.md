Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive, _ is 2, n is an integer between 5 and 49 inclusive, pattern is ['A', 'B', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'A'], stdin contains t-6 integers, 'YES' is being printed, i is 2**

The code appends two elements to the `pattern` list. The first line appends 'AB'[i % 2], which is 'B' since i is 2 and 2 % 2 is 0. The second line appends 'AB'[i % 2 ^ 1], which is 'A' since i is 2 and 2 % 2 ^ 1 is 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
