Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, _ is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive and is even, 'YES' is printed, stdin contains t-1 integers n (1 <= n <= 50), pattern is a list containing six elements: 'A', 'B', 'B', 'A', 'B', and 'A' in that order, i is 2**

The code snippet appends two elements to the `pattern` list. The first line appends the character at index `i % 2` from the string `'AB'`, which is `'B'` since `i` is 2. The second line appends the character at index `i % 2 ^ 1` from the string `'AB'`, which is `'A'` since `i` is 2. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. The `stdin` state also remains the same.
