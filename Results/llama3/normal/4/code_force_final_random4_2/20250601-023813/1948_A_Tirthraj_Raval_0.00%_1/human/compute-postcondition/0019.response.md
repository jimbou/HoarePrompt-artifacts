Output: **t is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, _ is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive and is even, 'YES' is printed, stdin contains t-1 integers n (1 <= n <= 50), pattern is a list containing n elements: 'A', 'B', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'A', ... (alternating between 'A' and 'B' with 'A' appearing first), i is n // 2 - 1, and the pattern is printed as a string of 'A's and 'B's, alternating between 'A' and 'B' with 'A' appearing first, with a total length of n**
