To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Since `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `n // 2` will be an integer between 1 and 25 inclusive. For the loop to execute again, `n // 2` must be greater than 2.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 4 and 50 inclusive, `pattern` is ['A', 'B', 'B', 'A'], `stdin` contains `t-4` integers, 'YES' is being printed, `i` is 2**
