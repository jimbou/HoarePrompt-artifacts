The code snippet appends two elements to the `pattern` list. The first line appends the character at index `i % 2` in the string `'AB'`, which is equivalent to appending the character at index `1 % 2` since `i` is 1. This results in appending the character `'B'` to the `pattern` list. The second line appends the character at index `i % 2 ^ 1` in the string `'AB'`, which is equivalent to appending the character at index `1 % 2 ^ 1`. Since `1 % 2` is 1 and `1 ^ 1` is 0, this results in appending the character `'A'` to the `pattern` list.

Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive, _ is 2, n is an integer between 2 and 49 inclusive, pattern is ['A', 'B', 'B', 'A'], stdin contains t-6 integers, 'YES' is being printed, i is 1**
