Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly determines whether it's possible to build a tower with m cubes after n moves. The program checks three conditions:

1. If the number of moves (n) is equal to the number of cubes (m), it prints 'YES' because Nikita can simply put one cube on top of the tower n times.

2. If the number of moves (n) is less than the number of cubes (m), it prints 'NO' because Nikita cannot build a tower with more cubes than the number of moves.

3. If the number of moves (n) is greater than or equal to the number of cubes (m), it checks if the number of moves (n) and the number of cubes (m) have the same parity (i.e., both are even or both are odd). If they have the same parity, it prints 'Yes' because Nikita can build a tower with m cubes by putting one cube on top of the tower m times and then removing one cube from the top of the tower (n-m) times. If they do not have the same parity, it prints 'No' because Nikita cannot build a tower with m cubes.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
