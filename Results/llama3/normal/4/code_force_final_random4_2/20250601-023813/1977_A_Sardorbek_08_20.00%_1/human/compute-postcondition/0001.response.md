To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and `a`. The loop will execute if `a` is at least 1.

State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 100)**
