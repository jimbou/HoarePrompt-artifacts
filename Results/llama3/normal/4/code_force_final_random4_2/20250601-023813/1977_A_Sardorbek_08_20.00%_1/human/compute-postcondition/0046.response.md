Output State: **a is an integer between 0 and 99 (inclusive), i is a is an integer between 0 and 99 (inclusive), b is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), c is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), q is a tuple containing two integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100), b and c are updated to the values of the two integers from the last line of stdin. If b is equal to c, 'YES' is printed. If b is less than c, 'NO' is printed. If b is greater than or equal to c, then if a and b have the same parity, 'Yes' is printed, otherwise 'No' is printed.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the variables have been updated accordingly. The value of `a` has been decremented to 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The value of `i` is now equal to the initial value of `a`, indicating that the loop has iterated `a` times. The values of `b` and `c` have been updated to the values of the two integers from the last line of stdin. The output state also indicates that the loop has printed the appropriate messages based on the values of `b` and `c`, and the parity of `a` and `b`.
