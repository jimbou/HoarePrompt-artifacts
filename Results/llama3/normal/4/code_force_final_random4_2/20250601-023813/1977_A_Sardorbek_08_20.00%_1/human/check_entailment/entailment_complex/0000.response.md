Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine if it's possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, either 1 cube is added or removed from the top of the tower.

The program correctly handles the cases where n is equal to m (in which case the answer is always "Yes") and where n is less than m (in which case the answer is always "No").

However, the program incorrectly handles the cases where n is greater than m. The condition `a % 2 == b % 2` is used to determine if n and t (the number of test cases) have the same parity, but this is not relevant to the problem. The correct condition should be `b % 2 == c % 2`, which checks if n and m have the same parity.

Since the program does not correctly handle all cases, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
