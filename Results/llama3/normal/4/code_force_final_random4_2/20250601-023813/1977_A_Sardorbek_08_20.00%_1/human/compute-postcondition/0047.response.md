Functionality: **This function reads multiple lines of input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t, and each subsequent line contains two integers n and m. It then iterates through each line, comparing the values of n and m, and prints 'YES' if they are equal, 'NO' if n is less than m, 'Yes' if n is greater than or equal to m and n and t have the same parity, and 'No' otherwise. The function does not return any value, but modifies the state of the program by printing the results of the comparisons and updating the values of n and m to the last line of input.**
