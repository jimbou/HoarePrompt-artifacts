Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 100).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(a):
    b, c = map(int, input().split())
    q = b, c
    if b == c:
        print('YES')
    elif b < c:
        print('NO')
    elif a % 2 == b % 2:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *a is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), i is 0, b is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), c is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), q is a tuple containing two integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100). If b is equal to c, 'YES' is being printed. If b is not equal to c, then if b is less than c, 'NO' is being printed. If b is not less than c, then if the current value of a and b have the same parity (i.e., both are even or both are odd), 'Yes' is being printed. Otherwise, 'No' is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *a is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), i is 1, b is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), c is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), q is a tuple containing two integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100). If b is equal to c, 'YES' is printed. If b is not equal to c, then if b is less than c, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, if the remainder of a divided by 2 is equal to the remainder of b divided by 2, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: a is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), i is 2, b is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), c is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), q is a tuple containing two integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100), b and c are updated to the values of the two integers from the first line of stdin. If b is equal to c, 'YES' is printed. If b is less than c, 'NO' is printed. If b is greater than or equal to c, then if a and b have the same parity, 'Yes' is printed, otherwise 'No' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
