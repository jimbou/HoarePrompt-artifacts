Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when the input is 4 2, the program should output "Yes" because Nikita can put 2 cubes on top of the tower and then remove 2 cubes to end up with a tower of 2 cubes. However, the program outputs "No" because it only checks if the number of moves is equal to the number of cubes, or if the number of moves is greater than the number of cubes and the parity of the number of moves is the same as the parity of the number of cubes. It does not consider the case where the number of moves is greater than the number of cubes and the parity of the number of moves is different from the parity of the number of cubes.

The correct solution should check if the difference between the number of moves and the number of cubes is even, because Nikita can always add or remove 2 cubes to the tower in one move. If the difference is even, then Nikita can end up with the desired number of cubes. Otherwise, it is not possible.

Here is the correct code:

```
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if (b - c) % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```
