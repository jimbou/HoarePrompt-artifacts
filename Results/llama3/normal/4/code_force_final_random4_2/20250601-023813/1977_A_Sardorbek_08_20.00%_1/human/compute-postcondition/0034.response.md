Output State: **a is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), i is 2, b is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), c is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), q is a tuple containing two integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100), b and c are updated to the values of the two integers from the first line of stdin.**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `i` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The values of `b` and `c` are updated to the two integers from the first line of stdin, which are between 1 and 100 (inclusive). The tuple `q` is updated to contain these two new values of `b` and `c`. The stdin still contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 100), but the first line has been consumed by the `input()` function.
