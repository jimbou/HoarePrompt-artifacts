Postcondition: ***a is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), i is 1, b is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), c is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), q is a tuple containing two integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100). If b is equal to c, 'YES' is printed. If b is not equal to c, then if b is less than c, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, if the remainder of a divided by 2 is equal to the remainder of b divided by 2, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.***
