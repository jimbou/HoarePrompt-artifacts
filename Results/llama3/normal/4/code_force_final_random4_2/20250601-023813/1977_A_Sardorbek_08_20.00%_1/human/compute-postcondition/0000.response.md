The code `a = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `a`. The stdin contains multiple lines of input, and the first line contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 100). After executing the code, the first line of the input is consumed, and the remaining lines are still in the stdin. The value of `a` is now equal to the value of `t`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 100).**
