Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the strategy for Eve to remove numbers optimally to maximize the number of times Bob wins. The key insight is that Bob wins when the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers is zero, which happens when there are an even number of each type of number (1, 2, 3, and 4).

The program calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by counting the number of pairs of each type of number that can be removed, and then adding 1 if there are three remaining numbers of different types (which can be removed to make the XOR zero).

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including when there are no numbers of a particular type, when there is only one number of a particular type, and when there are multiple numbers of each type. The use of integer division (`//`) and modulo (`%`) operations ensures that the program correctly handles cases where there are an odd number of numbers of a particular type.

Overall, the program is correct because it accurately implements the optimal strategy for Eve to remove numbers to maximize the number of times Bob wins, and it handles all possible cases correctly.
