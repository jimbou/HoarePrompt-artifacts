Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally. The key to solving this problem is to understand the properties of bitwise XOR and how Eve can remove numbers to maximize Bob's chances of winning.

The given program calculates the sum of the integer divisions of the four numbers by 2, which represents the number of pairs of each number that can be removed by Eve. This is because each pair of numbers with the same value will result in a bitwise XOR of 0, allowing Bob to win.

The program also checks if the sum of the remainders of three of the numbers divided by 2 equals 3. If this condition is true, it means that Eve can remove one more number to make the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers 0, allowing Bob to win.

The program's logic is correct, and it accurately calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Correctness: **True**
