Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())
    print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers, `i` is 0, stdin contains at least one integer less than the initial amount of integers, and this is printed: the sum of the integer division of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` by 2, plus 1 if the sum of the remainders of `a`, `b`, `c` divided by 2 is 3, otherwise 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers, `i` is 1, stdin is empty, and this is printed: the sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, plus 1 if the sum of the remainders of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` divided by 2 is equal to 3, otherwise 0

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers, `i` is 2, stdin is not empty and has at least one more input, and this is printed: the sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, plus 1 if the sum of the remainders of `a`, `b`, and `c` divided by 2 equals 3, otherwise 0




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
