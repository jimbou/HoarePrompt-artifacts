To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the loop head and how it affects the state.

The loop head is `for i in range(int(input())):`. The key elements here are `i` and the input from `stdin`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `stdin` is empty. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (since it's a range-based loop), and there needs to be another input available in `stdin` to be read by `int(input())`.

Since `stdin` is empty, we need to assume that there is another input available for the loop to execute again. This means that the state of `stdin` needs to be adjusted to reflect that there is another input available.

The other variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are not directly related to the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers, `i` is 2, stdin is not empty and has at least one more input**
