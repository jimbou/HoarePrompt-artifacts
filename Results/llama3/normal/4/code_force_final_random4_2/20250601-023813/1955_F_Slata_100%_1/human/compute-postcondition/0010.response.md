The code prints the sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, plus 1 if the sum of the remainders of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` divided by 2 is exactly 3.

Output: **sum of integer divisions of a, b, c, and d by 2, plus 1 if the sum of the remainders of a, b, c, and d divided by 2 is exactly 3**
