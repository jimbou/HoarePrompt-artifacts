Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers, `i` is 0, stdin contains at least one integer less than the initial amount of integers.**

In this output state, the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are assigned the values of four integers from the input, where `input().split()` accepts a space-separated list of integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The stdin contains at least one integer less than the initial amount of integers. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 0.
