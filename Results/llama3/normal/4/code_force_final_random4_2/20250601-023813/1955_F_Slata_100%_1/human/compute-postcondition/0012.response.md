Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers, `i` is equal to the initial value of `t`, stdin is empty, and this is printed: the sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, plus 1 if the sum of the remainders of `a`, `b`, and `c` divided by 2 equals 3, otherwise 0**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` will still be integers, the loop counter `i` will be equal to the initial value of `t` (which represents the number of test cases), the standard input (stdin) will be empty because all the input lines have been processed, and the output will be the sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, plus 1 if the sum of the remainders of `a`, `b`, and `c` divided by 2 equals 3, otherwise 0.
