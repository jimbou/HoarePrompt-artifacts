The code prints the sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, plus the integer value of the expression `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3`. 

Since `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers, the expression `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2` will be equal to 3 if and only if exactly three of `a`, `b`, and `c` are odd. 

The `int()` function will convert the boolean result of the expression `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3` to an integer, where `True` becomes 1 and `False` becomes 0.

Output: **the sum of the integer divisions of a, b, c, and d by 2, plus 1 if exactly three of a, b, and c are odd, otherwise 0**
