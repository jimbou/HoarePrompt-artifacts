The code assigns the values from the input to the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. Since stdin contains at least one integer, the input will be a list of integers separated by spaces. The `map(int, ...)` function converts these integers to integers, and the `input().split()` function splits the input into a list of strings, which are then converted to integers.

The values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are now integers, and their values are determined by the input. The value of `i` is still 1, as it is not affected by the code.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers, `i` is 1, stdin is empty**
