To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and the input from `stdin`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input from `stdin`. If the input from `stdin` contains at least one integer, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the input from `stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by `t` lines, each containing four integers `p_i` (0 <= p_i <= 200). So for the loop to be executed, the input from `stdin` must contain at least one integer, and `i` is 0.

State: **stdin contains at least one integer, i is 0**
