This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of four integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the sum of the integer divisions of the four numbers by 2, plus 1 if the sum of the remainders of three of the numbers divided by 2 equals 3, otherwise 0. The function processes all test cases and then terminates, leaving the standard input empty.
