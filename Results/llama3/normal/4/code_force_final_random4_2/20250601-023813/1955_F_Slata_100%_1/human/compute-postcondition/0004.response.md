To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the loop head and how it affects the state.

The loop head is `for i in range(int(input())):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the integer read from the standard input.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `stdin` contains at least one integer less than the initial amount of integers. This means that the integer read from `stdin` is at least 1.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. Additionally, `stdin` must still contain at least one integer, since the loop condition depends on the integer read from `stdin`.

The other variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are not affected by the loop head, so their values remain the same.

State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers, `i` is 1, stdin contains at least one integer**
