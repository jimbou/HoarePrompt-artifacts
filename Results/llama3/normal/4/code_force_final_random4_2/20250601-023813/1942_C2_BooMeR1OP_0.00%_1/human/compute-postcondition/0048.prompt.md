Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `y` is an integer between 0 and `n - x`, `a` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 0 to `n - 1`, `present` is a set of `x` distinct integers from 0 to `n - 1`, `i` is `x - 1`, `t1` is an integer between 1 and `n - 1`, `t2` is an integer between 2 and `n - 1`, `ans` is an integer equal to `x - 1 + (x - 2)` if `t1` is not in the set `present` and `t2` is in the set `present`, otherwise `ans` is an integer equal to `x - 2 + (x - 2)`, `gaps` is a sorted list containing `x` integers, each integer is equal to `next_elem - a[i] - 1`, and `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases.
Code of the loop:
for gap in gaps:
    pairs = gap // 2
    if y >= pairs:
        ans += gap
        y -= pairs
    else:
        ans += 2 * y
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer greater than 0, y is an integer between 0 and n - x, a is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 0 to n - 1, present is a set of x distinct integers from 0 to n - 1, i is x - 1, t1 is an integer between 1 and n - 1, t2 is an integer between 2 and n - 1, gaps is a sorted list containing at least 1 integer, each integer is equal to next_elem - a[i] - 1, gap is the first element in the list gaps, pairs is an integer equal to gap // 2, and stdin contains t - 1 test cases. If y is greater than or equal to pairs, ans is an integer equal to x - 1 + (x - 2) + gap if t1 is not in the set present and t2 is in the set present, otherwise ans is an integer equal to x - 2 + (x - 2) + gap. If y is less than pairs, ans is an integer equal to x - 1 + (x - 2) + 2 * y if t1 is not in the set present and t2 is in the set present, otherwise ans is an integer equal to x - 2 + (x - 2) + 2 * y.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer greater than 0, y is an integer between 0 and n - x, a is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 0 to n - 1, present is a set of x distinct integers from 0 to n - 1, i is x - 1, t1 is an integer between 1 and n - 1, t2 is an integer between 2 and n - 1, gaps is a sorted list containing at least 2 integers, each integer is equal to next_elem - a[i] - 1, gap is the second element in the list gaps, pairs is an integer equal to gap // 2, ans is an integer equal to x - 1 + (x - 2) + gap + gap if y is greater than or equal to pairs and t1 is not in the set present and t2 is in the set present, otherwise ans is an integer equal to x - 2 + (x - 2) + gap + gap if y is greater than or equal to pairs, otherwise ans is an integer equal to x - 1 + (x - 2) + 2 * y + gap if t1 is not in the set present and t2 is in the set present, otherwise ans is an integer equal to x - 2 + (x - 2) + 2 * y + gap if y is greater than or equal to pairs, otherwise ans is an integer equal to x - 1 + (x - 2) + 2 * y + 2 * y if t1 is not in the set present and t2 is in the set present, otherwise ans is an integer equal to x - 2 + (x - 2) + 2 * y + 2 * y, and stdin contains t - 1 test cases if y is greater than or equal to pairs, otherwise stdin contains t - 2 test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer greater than 0, y is an integer between 0 and n - x, a is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 0 to n - 1, present is a set of x distinct integers from 0 to n - 1, i is x - 1, t1 is an integer between 1 and n - 1, t2 is an integer between 2 and n - 1, gaps is a sorted list containing at least 3 integers, each integer is equal to next_elem - a[i] - 1, gap is the third element in the list gaps, pairs is an integer equal to gap // 2. If y is greater than or equal to pairs, then ans is an integer equal to its original value plus gap, y is an integer equal to its original value minus pairs, and stdin contains t - 1 test cases. Otherwise, ans is an integer equal to x - 1 + (x - 2) + gap + gap if t1 is not in the set present and t2 is in the set present, otherwise ans is an integer equal to x - 2 + (x - 2) + gap + gap, and stdin contains t - 2 test cases if y is greater than or equal to pairs, otherwise stdin contains t - 2 test cases.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
