Output State: **n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer greater than 0, y is an integer between 0 and n - x, a is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 0 to n - 1, present is a set of x distinct integers from 0 to n - 1, i is x - 1, t1 is an integer between 1 and n - 1, t2 is an integer between 2 and n - 1, gaps is an empty list, stdin contains t - 1 test cases if y is greater than or equal to pairs, otherwise stdin contains t - (number of iterations) test cases. If y is greater than or equal to pairs, then ans is an integer equal to its original value plus the sum of all gaps, y is an integer equal to its original value minus the sum of all pairs. Otherwise, ans is an integer equal to its original value plus 2 * y, and stdin contains t - (number of iterations) test cases.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop will continue to execute until the list `gaps` is empty. In each iteration, if `y` is greater than or equal to `pairs` (which is half of the current gap), `ans` will be incremented by the current gap and `y` will be decremented by `pairs`. If `y` is less than `pairs`, `ans` will be incremented by twice the value of `y` and the loop will break.

After the loop finishes executing, the state of the variables will be as follows:

* `n`, `x`, `a`, `present`, `i`, `t1`, and `t2` will remain unchanged.
* `gaps` will be an empty list.
* `stdin` will contain `t - 1` test cases if `y` is greater than or equal to `pairs`, otherwise it will contain `t - (number of iterations)` test cases.
* `ans` will be incremented by the sum of all gaps if `y` is greater than or equal to `pairs`, otherwise it will be incremented by twice the value of `y`.
* `y` will be decremented by the sum of all pairs if `y` is greater than or equal to `pairs`.
