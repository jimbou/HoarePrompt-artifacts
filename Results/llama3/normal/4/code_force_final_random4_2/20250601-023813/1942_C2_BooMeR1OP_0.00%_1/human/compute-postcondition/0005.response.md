Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5) and must be at least 1, `y` is an integer between 0 and n - x, `a` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 0 to n - 1, `present` is a set of x distinct integers from 0 to n - 1, `i` is 0, `t1` is an integer between 1 and n, `t2` is an integer between 2 and n, stdin contains t - 1 test cases. If `t1` is not in the set `present` and `t2` is in the set `present`, then `ans` is an integer equal to x - 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains an integer equal to x - 2.***
