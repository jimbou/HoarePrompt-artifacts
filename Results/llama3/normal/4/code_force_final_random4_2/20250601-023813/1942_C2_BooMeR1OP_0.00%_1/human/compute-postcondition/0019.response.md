Output State: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `y` is an integer between 0 and `n - x`, `a` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 0 to `n - 1`, `present` is a set of `x` distinct integers from 0 to `n - 1`, `i` is 0, `t1` is an integer between 1 and `n - 1`, `t2` is an integer between 2 and `n - 1`, `ans` is an integer equal to `x - 1 + (x - 2)` if `t1` is not in the set `present` and `t2` is in the set `present`, otherwise `ans` is an integer equal to `x - 2 + (x - 2)`, `gaps` is a list containing two integers, the first integer is equal to `next_elem - a[0] - 1` and the second integer is equal to `next_elem - a[0] - 1`, `next_elem` is an integer equal to `a[1] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0)`, and the current value of `gap` is an integer greater than 0, which is equal to `next_elem - a[0] - 1`, stdin contains `t - 1` test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `gaps` now contains two integers, both of which are equal to the current value of `gap`, which is `next_elem - a[0] - 1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
