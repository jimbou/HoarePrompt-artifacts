Output State: **n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer greater than 0, y is an integer between 0 and n - x, a is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 0 to n - 1, present is a set of x distinct integers from 0 to n - 1, i is x - 1, t1 is an integer between 1 and n - 1, t2 is an integer between 2 and n - 1, ans is an integer equal to x - 1 + (x - 2) + gap if t1 is not in the set present and t2 is in the set present, otherwise ans is an integer equal to x - 2 + (x - 2) + gap, gaps is a sorted list containing at least 1 integer, each integer is equal to next_elem - a[i] - 1, gap is the first element in the list gaps, pairs is an integer equal to gap // 2, and stdin contains t - 1 test cases.**

The code adds the value of `gap` to `ans` and subtracts `pairs` from `y`. Since `y` is greater than or equal to `pairs`, the value of `y` remains non-negative. The value of `ans` is updated by adding `gap` to its previous value. The value of `gap` is the first element in the list `gaps`, which is a sorted list containing at least 1 integer, each integer is equal to `next_elem - a[i] - 1`. The value of `pairs` is equal to `gap // 2`.
