Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5) and must be at least 2, `y` is an integer between 0 and n - x, `a` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 0 to n - 1, `present` is a set of x distinct integers from 0 to n - 1, `i` is 1, `t1` is an integer between 1 and n, `t2` is an integer between 2 and n, `ans` is an integer equal to x - 1 + 1 if t1 is not in the set present and t2 is in the set present, otherwise ans is an integer equal to x - 2 + 1, stdin contains t - 1 test cases.**
