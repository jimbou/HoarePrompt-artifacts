Correctness: **True**.

The program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description. It correctly calculates the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be obtained by choosing additional vertices.

The program first calculates the number of triangular pieces that can be obtained using the already chosen vertices. It then calculates the number of gaps between these vertices and sorts them in ascending order. The program then iterates over the gaps and calculates the maximum number of pairs that can be formed in each gap. If the number of pairs is less than or equal to the remaining number of vertices that can be chosen (y), it adds the number of pairs to the answer and subtracts the number of pairs from y. If the number of pairs is greater than y, it adds 2*y to the answer and breaks the loop.

The program correctly handles the case where the number of chosen vertices (x) is 2, in which case the number of triangular pieces is x-2. It also correctly handles the case where the number of gaps is 0, in which case the number of triangular pieces is x-2.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
