The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and x, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `x` is an integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `x` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than 1, `y` is an integer between 0 and `n - x`, `a` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 0 to `n - 1`, `present` is a set of `x` distinct integers from 0 to `n - 1`, `i` is 1, `t1` is an integer between 1 and `n - 1`, `t2` is an integer between 2 and `n - 1`, `ans` is an integer equal to `x - 1 + (x - 2)` if `t1` is not in the set `present` and `t2` is in the set `present`, otherwise `ans` is an integer equal to `x - 2 + (x - 2)`, `gaps` is a list containing one or two integers, if the current value of `gap` is greater than 0, then `gaps` contains two integers, the first integer is equal to `next_elem - a[0] - 1` and the second integer is equal to `next_elem - a[0] - 1`, otherwise `gaps` contains one integer, `next_elem` is an integer equal to `a[1] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0)`, and stdin contains `t - 1` test cases.**
