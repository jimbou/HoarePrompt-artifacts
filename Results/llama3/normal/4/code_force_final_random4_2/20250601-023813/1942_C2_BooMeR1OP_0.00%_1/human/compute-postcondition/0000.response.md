Output State: **n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is an integer between 0 and n - x, a is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 0 to n - 1, present is a set of x distinct integers from 0 to n - 1, ans is an integer equal to x - 2, stdin contains t - 1 test cases.**

The code executes as follows:

- The first line reads three integers from stdin, assigning them to n, x, and y, respectively. This reduces the number of test cases in stdin by 1.
- The second line reads x distinct integers from stdin, assigning them to a. This reduces the number of test cases in stdin by 1.
- The third line subtracts 1 from each integer in a, effectively shifting the range of integers from 1 to n to 0 to n - 1.
- The fourth line sorts the list a in ascending order.
- The fifth line creates a set present from the list a, containing the same x distinct integers from 0 to n - 1.
- The sixth line assigns the value of x - 2 to ans.

After the code executes, the state of the variables is as follows:

- n is an integer between 4 and 10^9.
- x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5).
- y is an integer between 0 and n - x.
- a is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 0 to n - 1.
- present is a set of x distinct integers from 0 to n - 1.
- ans is an integer equal to x - 2.
- stdin contains t - 1 test cases.
