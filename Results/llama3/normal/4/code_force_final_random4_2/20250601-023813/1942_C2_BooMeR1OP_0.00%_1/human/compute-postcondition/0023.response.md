Output State: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than 1, `y` is an integer between 0 and `n` - `x`, `a` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 0 to `n` - 1, `present` is a set of `x` distinct integers from 0 to `n` - 1, `i` is 1, `t1` is an integer between 1 and `n` - 1, `t2` is an integer between 2 and `n` - 1, `ans` is an integer equal to `x` - 1 + (`x` - 2) if `t1` is not in the set `present` and `t2` is in the set `present`, otherwise `ans` is an integer equal to `x` - 2 + (`x` - 2), `gaps` is a list containing one or two integers, if the current value of `gap` is greater than 0, then `gaps` contains two integers, the first integer is equal to `next_elem` - `a[0]` - 1 and the second integer is equal to `next_elem` - `a[0]` - 1, otherwise `gaps` contains one integer, `next_elem` is an integer equal to `a[(i + 1) % x]` + (`n` if `i` == `x` - 1 else 0), `gap` is an integer equal to `next_elem` - `a[i]` - 1, and `stdin` contains `t` - 1 test cases.**

The code appends the value of `gap` to the list `gaps`. The value of `gap` is calculated as `next_elem` - `a[i]` - 1, where `next_elem` is the next element in the list `a` after the current element `a[i]`, wrapping around to the start of the list if necessary, and adding `n` if `i` is equal to `x` - 1. The list `gaps` now contains one or two integers, depending on the value of `gap`. If `gap` is greater than 0, `gaps` contains two integers, both equal to `next_elem` - `a[0]` - 1. Otherwise, `gaps` contains one integer. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
