Output: **n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer greater than 0, y is an integer between 0 and n - x, a is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 0 to n - 1, present is a set of x distinct integers from 0 to n - 1, i is x - 1, t1 is an integer between 1 and n - 1, t2 is an integer between 2 and n - 1, gaps is an empty list, stdin contains t - 1 test cases if y is greater than or equal to pairs, otherwise stdin contains t - (number of iterations) test cases. If y is greater than or equal to pairs, then ans is an integer equal to its original value plus the sum of all gaps, y is an integer equal to its original value minus the sum of all pairs. Otherwise, ans is an integer equal to its original value plus 2 * y, and stdin contains t - (number of iterations) test cases, and ans is printed**
