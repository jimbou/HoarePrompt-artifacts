Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 3 and min(n, 2 * 10^5) and must be at least 3, y is an integer between 0 and n - x, a is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 0 to n - 1, present is a set of x distinct integers from 0 to n - 1, i is 2, t1 is an integer between 1 and n - 1, t2 is an integer between 2 and n - 1, ans is an integer equal to x - 1 + 2 if t1 is not in the set present and t2 is in the set present, otherwise ans is an integer equal to x - 2 + 2, stdin contains t - 1 test cases.***
