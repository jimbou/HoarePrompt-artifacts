Output State: **n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5) and must be at least 1, y is an integer between 0 and n - x, a is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 0 to n - 1, present is a set of x distinct integers from 0 to n - 1, ans is an integer equal to x - 2, i is 0, t1 is an integer between 1 and n, t2 is an integer between 2 and n, stdin contains t - 1 test cases.**

The code assigns the value of `(a[i] + 1) % n` to `t1` and the value of `(a[i] + 2) % n` to `t2`. Since `a[i]` is an integer between 0 and `n - 1`, `t1` and `t2` will be integers between 1 and `n`. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `present`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `t1` and `t2` are newly introduced and calculated based on the value of `a[i]`. Stdin remains unchanged as no input operations are performed.
