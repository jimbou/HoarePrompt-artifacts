Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an integer between 0 and n - x, `a` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 0 to n - 1, `present` is a set of x distinct integers from 0 to n - 1, `i` is x - 1, `t1` is an integer between 1 and n - 1, `t2` is an integer between 2 and n - 1, `ans` is an integer equal to x - 1 + (x - 2) if t1 is not in the set present and t2 is in the set present, otherwise ans is an integer equal to x - 2 + (x - 2), `gaps` is an empty list, stdin contains t - 1 test cases.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(x):
    next_elem = a[(i + 1) % x] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0)
    gap = next_elem - a[i] - 1
    if gap > 0:
        gaps.append(gap)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `y` is an integer between 0 and `n - x`, `a` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 0 to `n - 1`, `present` is a set of `x` distinct integers from 0 to `n - 1`, `i` is 0, `t1` is an integer between 1 and `n - 1`, `t2` is an integer between 2 and `n - 1`, `ans` is an integer equal to `x - 1 + (x - 2)` if `t1` is not in the set `present` and `t2` is in the set `present`, otherwise `ans` is an integer equal to `x - 2 + (x - 2)`, `gaps` is a list containing one or two integers, if the current value of `gap` is greater than 0, then `gaps` contains two integers, the first integer is equal to `next_elem - a[0] - 1` and the second integer is equal to `next_elem - a[0] - 1`, otherwise `gaps` contains one integer, `next_elem` is an integer equal to `a[1] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0)`, and stdin contains `t - 1` test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than 1, `y` is an integer between 0 and `n` - `x`, `a` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 0 to `n` - 1, `present` is a set of `x` distinct integers from 0 to `n` - 1, `i` is 1, `t1` is an integer between 1 and `n` - 1, `t2` is an integer between 2 and `n` - 1, `ans` is an integer equal to `x` - 1 + (`x` - 2) if `t1` is not in the set `present` and `t2` is in the set `present`, otherwise `ans` is an integer equal to `x` - 2 + (`x` - 2), `gaps` is a list containing one or two integers, if the current value of `gap` is greater than 0, then `gaps` contains two integers, the first integer is equal to `next_elem` - `a[0]` - 1 and the second integer is equal to `next_elem` - `a[0]` - 1, otherwise `gaps` contains one integer, `next_elem` is an integer equal to `a[(i + 1) % x]` + (`n` if `i` == `x` - 1 else 0), `gap` is an integer equal to `next_elem` - `a[i]` - 1, and `stdin` contains `t` - 1 test cases. If `gap` > 0, then `gaps` contains two integers, otherwise `gaps` contains one integer.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer greater than 2, y is an integer between 0 and n - x, a is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 0 to n - 1, present is a set of x distinct integers from 0 to n - 1, i is 2, t1 is an integer between 1 and n - 1, t2 is an integer between 2 and n - 1, ans is an integer equal to x - 1 + (x - 2) if t1 is not in the set present and t2 is in the set present, otherwise ans is an integer equal to x - 2 + (x - 2), gaps is a list containing one or two integers, next_elem is an integer equal to a[(i + 1) % x] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0), and stdin contains t - 1 test cases. If the gap between the current element and the next element in the list a is greater than 0, then gaps contains two integers. Otherwise, gaps contains one integer.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
