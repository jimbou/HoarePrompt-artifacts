Output State: **n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 3 and min(n, 2 * 10^5) and must be at least 3, y is an integer between 0 and n - x, a is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 0 to n - 1, present is a set of x distinct integers from 0 to n - 1, i is 2, t1 is an integer between 1 and n - 1, t2 is an integer between 2 and n - 1, ans is an integer equal to x - 1 + 1 if t1 is not in the set present and t2 is in the set present, otherwise ans is an integer equal to x - 2 + 1, stdin contains t - 1 test cases.**

The code assigns the value of `(a[i] + 1) % n` to `t1` and the value of `(a[i] + 2) % n` to `t2`. Since `a` is a sorted list of distinct integers from 0 to `n - 1`, and `i` is 2, `a[i]` is the third smallest integer in the list. The expression `(a[i] + 1) % n` will result in an integer between 1 and `n - 1`, and `(a[i] + 2) % n` will result in an integer between 2 and `n - 1`. The values of `t1` and `t2` are now determined by these expressions. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
