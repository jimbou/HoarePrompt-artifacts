Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `y` is an integer between 0 and `n - x`, `a` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 0 to `n - 1`, `present` is a set of `x` distinct integers from 0 to `n - 1`, `i` is `x - 1`, `t1` is an integer between 1 and `n - 1`, `t2` is an integer between 2 and `n - 1`, `ans` is an integer equal to `x - 1 + (x - 2)` if `t1` is not in the set `present` and `t2` is in the set `present`, otherwise `ans` is an integer equal to `x - 2 + (x - 2)`, `gaps` is a sorted list containing at least 1 integer, each integer is equal to `next_elem - a[i] - 1`, `gap` is the first element in the list `gaps`, `pairs` is an integer equal to `gap // 2`, and `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases. The current value of `y` is greater than or equal to `pairs`***
