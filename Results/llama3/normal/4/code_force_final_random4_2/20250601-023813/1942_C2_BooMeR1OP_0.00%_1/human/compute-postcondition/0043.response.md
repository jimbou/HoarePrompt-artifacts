The only object in the loop head is variable gap and list gaps, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list gaps.  If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, gaps is a sorted list containing at least 2 integers, each integer is equal to next_elem - a[i] - 1, gap is the second element in the list gaps. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the gap is the third element in the list.
State: **n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer greater than 0, y is an integer between 0 and n - x, a is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 0 to n - 1, present is a set of x distinct integers from 0 to n - 1, i is x - 1, t1 is an integer between 1 and n - 1, t2 is an integer between 2 and n - 1, gaps is a sorted list containing at least 3 integers, each integer is equal to next_elem - a[i] - 1, gap is the third element in the list gaps, pairs is an integer equal to gap // 2, ans is an integer equal to x - 1 + (x - 2) + gap + gap if y is greater than or equal to pairs and t1 is not in the set present and t2 is in the set present, otherwise ans is an integer equal to x - 2 + (x - 2) + gap + gap if y is greater than or equal to pairs, otherwise ans is an integer equal to x - 1 + (x - 2) + 2 * y + gap if t1 is not in the set present and t2 is in the set present, otherwise ans is an integer equal to x - 2 + (x - 2) + 2 * y + gap if y is greater than or equal to pairs, otherwise ans is an integer equal to x - 1 + (x - 2) + 2 * y + 2 * y if t1 is not in the set present and t2 is in the set present, otherwise ans is an integer equal to x - 2 + (x - 2) + 2 * y + 2 * y, and stdin contains t - 1 test cases if y is greater than or equal to pairs, otherwise stdin contains t - 2 test cases.**
