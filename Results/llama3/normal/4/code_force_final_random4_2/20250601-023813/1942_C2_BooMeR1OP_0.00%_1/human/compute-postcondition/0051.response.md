Functionality: **This function calculates the maximum number of pairs that can be formed from a given set of integers, considering the constraints of the problem. It takes as input the number of test cases, the number of integers in each test case, and the integers themselves. It then calculates the maximum number of pairs that can be formed by considering the gaps between the integers and the remaining available pairs. The function prints the maximum number of pairs that can be formed for each test case.**
