Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, a is a string, b is a string, ans is an empty string, i is 0, work is True, j is undefined, counter is undefined, t is undefined, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a):
    if work:
        ans += a[i]
        if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
            work = False
        elif i + 1 == len(a):
            ans += b[i]
            break
        else:
            i += 1
    else:
        ans += b[i]
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string containing the first character of `a` and the last character of `b` if `i + 1` is equal to `len(a)`, otherwise `ans` is a string containing the first character of `a`. `i` is equal to the last index of `a` if `i + 1` is equal to `len(a)`, otherwise `i` is 1. If `work` is True, `work` remains True. If `work` is False, `work` remains False. `j` is undefined, `counter` is undefined, `t` is undefined, `stdin` is empty. If `work` is False, `ans` is a string equal to the first character of `b`, `i` is 1, and `work` is False.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty string and len(a) is greater than 1, `b` is a string, `i` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to the last index of `a`. If `work` is True, `ans` is a string containing the first character of `a` and the character at index `i` of `a`. If `i` is the second last index of `a`, `ans` also contains the character at index `i` of `b`. If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, then `work` is False. Otherwise, `work` is True or False. If `work` is False, `ans` is a string containing the first character of `a` and the character at index `i` of `b`. `j`, `counter`, `t` are undefined, `stdin` is empty.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty string and len(a) is greater than 1, `b` is a string, `i` is greater than 1 and less than the last index of `a`, `j`, `counter`, `t` are undefined, `stdin` is empty. If `work` is True, `ans` is a string containing the first character of `a` and the character at index `i` of `a`. If `i` is the second last index of `a`, `ans` also contains the character at index `i` of `b`. If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, then `work` is False and `ans` is a string containing the first character of `a` and the character at index `i` of `b`. If `work` is False, `ans` is a string containing the first character of `a` and the character at index `i` of `b`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
