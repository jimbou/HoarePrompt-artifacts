Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a string with at least 3 characters, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string and its value is being printed, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is False, `t` is greater than 1, `j` is equal to the length of `a` - 1, `counter` is 1**

In this output state, a new variable `counter` is introduced and assigned the value 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The variable `n` is still an integer, `a` is a string with at least 3 characters, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string and its value is being printed, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is False, `t` is greater than 1, and `j` is equal to the length of `a` - 1.
