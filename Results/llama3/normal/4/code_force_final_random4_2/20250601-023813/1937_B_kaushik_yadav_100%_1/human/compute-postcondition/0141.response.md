Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string containing the first character of `a` and the last character of `b` if `i + 1` is equal to `len(a)`, otherwise `ans` is a string containing the first character of `a`. `i` is equal to the last index of `a` if `i + 1` is equal to `len(a)`, otherwise `i` is 1. `work` is True, `j` is undefined, `counter` is undefined, `t` is undefined, stdin is empty. Either `i` is less than `len(a)` or `b[i - 1]` is less than `a[i]` if `i + 1` is not equal to `len(a)`.***
