Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty string and len(a) is greater than 1, `b` is a string, `i` is greater than 1 and less than the last index of `a`, `work` is False, `ans` is a string containing the first character of `a`, the character at index `i` of `a` and the character at index `i` of `b`, `j`, `counter`, `t` are undefined, `stdin` is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `work` has been changed to False. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is a string containing the first character of `a`, the character at index `i` of `a` and the character at index `i` of `b`, because `work` is False.
