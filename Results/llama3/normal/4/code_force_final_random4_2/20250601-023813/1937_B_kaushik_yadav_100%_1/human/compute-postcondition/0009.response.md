Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string that is the first character of `a`, `i` is 0, `work` is True, and either `i + 1` is not less than the length of `a` or `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`. The current value of `i + 1` equals the length of `a`.***
