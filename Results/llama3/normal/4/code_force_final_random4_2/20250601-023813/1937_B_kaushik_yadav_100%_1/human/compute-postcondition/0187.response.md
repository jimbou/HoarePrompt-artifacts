Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string containing the characters of `a` and `b` in an alternating pattern, `i` is equal to the last index of `a`, `work` is False, `j` is 2, `counter` is either 1, 2, or 3, `t` is undefined, `stdin` is empty, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all the variables retain their initial values since the break statement does not modify any variables. The only change is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement we were directly inside.
