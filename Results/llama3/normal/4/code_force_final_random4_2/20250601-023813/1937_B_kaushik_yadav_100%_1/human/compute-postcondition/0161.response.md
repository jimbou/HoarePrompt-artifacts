Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty string and len(a) is greater than 1, `b` is a string, `i` is greater than 1 and less than the last index of `a`, `j`, `counter`, `t` are undefined, `stdin` is empty. If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, then `work` is False and `ans` is a string containing the first character of `a`, the character at index `i` of `a` and the character at index `i` of `b`. If `i + 1 == len(a)`, then `work` is True and `ans` is a string containing the first character of `a`, the character at index `i` of `a`, the character at index `i` of `a`, and the character at index `i` of `b`. Otherwise, if `work` is True, `ans` is a string containing the first character of `a`, the character at index `i-1` of `a` and the character at index `i-1` of `a`. If `i-1` is the second last index of `a`, `ans` also contains the character at index `i-1` of `b`. If `i < len(a)` and `b[i-1] < a[i]`, then `work` is False. Otherwise, `work` is True or False. If `work` is False, `ans` is a string containing the first character of `a`, the character at index `i-1` of `a` and the character at index `i-1` of `b`.***
