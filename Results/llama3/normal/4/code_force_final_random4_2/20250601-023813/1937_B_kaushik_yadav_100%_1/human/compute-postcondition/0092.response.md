Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a string with at least `i + 1` characters, `b` is a string, `t` is greater than 1, `ans` is increased by the character at index `i` of string `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by appending the character at index `i` of string `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin is still empty.
