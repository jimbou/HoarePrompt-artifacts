This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer and two binary strings of the same length. It then generates a new string by alternating characters from the two input strings, starting with the first string, and prints this new string. Additionally, it counts the number of consecutive occurrences of a specific pattern in the input strings and prints this count. The function repeats this process for all test cases, consuming all input from standard input.
