Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string containing the characters of `a` and `b` in an alternating pattern, `i` is equal to the last index of `a`, `work` is False, `j` is undefined, `counter` is 1, `t` is undefined, `stdin` is empty, and the string `ans` containing the characters of `a` and `b` in an alternating pattern is being printed.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(len(a) - 1):
    if a[j + 1] == b[j]:
        counter += 1
    elif a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1':
        counter = 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string containing the characters of `a` and `b` in an alternating pattern, `i` is equal to the last index of `a`, `work` is False, `j` is 0, `counter` is either 1 or 2, `t` is undefined, `stdin` is empty, and the string `ans` containing the characters of `a` and `b` in an alternating pattern is being printed. If the character at index `j + 1` of string `a` is equal to the character at index `j` of string `b`, then `counter` is 2. Otherwise, if the character at index `j + 1` of string `a` is '0' and the character at index `j` of string `b` is '1', then the current values of `a[j + 1]` and `b[j]` are '0' and '1' respectively. In all other cases, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string containing the characters of `a` and `b` in an alternating pattern, `i` is equal to the last index of `a`, `work` is False, `j` is 1, `counter` is either 1, 2, or 3, `t` is undefined, `stdin` is empty, and the string `ans` containing the characters of `a` and `b` in an alternating pattern is being printed. If the character at index `j + 1` of string `a` is equal to the character at index `j` of string `b`, then `counter` is 3. If the character at index `j + 1` of string `a` is '0' and the character at index `j` of string `b` is '1', then the current values of `a[j + 1]` and `b[j]` are '0' and '1' respectively, and `counter` is 1. In all other cases, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string containing the characters of `a` and `b` in an alternating pattern, `i` is equal to the last index of `a`, `work` is False, `j` is 2, `stdin` is empty, and the string `ans` containing the characters of `a` and `b` in an alternating pattern is being printed. If `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]`, then `counter` is either 2, 3, or 4. Otherwise, if `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', then `counter` is 1. In all other cases, `counter` is either 1, 2, or 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
