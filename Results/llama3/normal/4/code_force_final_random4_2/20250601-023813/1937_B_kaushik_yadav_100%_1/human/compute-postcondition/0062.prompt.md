Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string that is the first character of `a` plus the character at index `i - 1` of `a` plus the character at index `i` of `a` if `work` is True, otherwise `ans` is a string consisting of the first character of `b` plus the character at index `i` of `a`, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is a boolean, `counter` is 1, and the string `ans` is being printed, stdin contains no inputs.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(len(a) - 1):
    if a[j + 1] == b[j]:
        counter += 1
    elif a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1':
        counter = 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string with a length of at least 2, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string that is the first character of `a` plus the character at index `i - 1` of `a` plus the character at index `i` of `a` if `work` is True, otherwise `ans` is a string consisting of the first character of `b` plus the character at index `i` of `a`, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is a boolean, `counter` is 2 if the character at index `j + 1` of `a` is equal to the character at index `j` of `b`, otherwise `counter` is 1, `j` is 0, and the string `ans` is being printed, stdin contains no inputs. Additionally, if the character at index `j + 1` of `a` is not equal to the character at index `j` of `b`, and `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', then the current values of `a[j + 1]` and `b[j]` are noted, otherwise we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string with a length of at least 2, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string that is the first character of `a` plus the character at index `i - 1` of `a` plus the character at index `i` of `a` if `work` is True, otherwise `ans` is a string consisting of the first character of `b` plus the character at index `i` of `a`, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is a boolean, `j` is 1, and the string `ans` is being printed, stdin contains no inputs. If the character at index `j + 1` of `a` is equal to the character at index `j` of `b`, then `counter` is 3. If the character at index `j + 1` of `a` is not equal to the character at index `j` of `b`, and `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', then the current values of `a[j + 1]` and `b[j]` are noted and `counter` is 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `counter` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string with a length of at least 2, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string that is the first character of `a` plus the character at index `i - 1` of `a` plus the character at index `i` of `a` if `work` is True, otherwise `ans` is a string consisting of the first character of `b` plus the character at index `i` of `a`, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is a boolean, `j` is 2, and the string `ans` is being printed, stdin contains no inputs. If the character at index `j + 1` of `a` is equal to the character at index `j` of `b`, then `counter` is either 4, 2, or 2. If the character at index `j + 1` of `a` is not equal to the character at index `j` of `b`, and `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', then `counter` is 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `counter` is 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
