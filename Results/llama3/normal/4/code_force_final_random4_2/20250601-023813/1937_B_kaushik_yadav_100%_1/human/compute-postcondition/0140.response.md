The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Since `i` was 0, it is now 1. The other variables are not affected. The condition "Either `i + 1` is less than `len(a)` or `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`" is still valid, but now it is "Either `i` is less than `len(a)` or `b[i - 1]` is less than `a[i]`". 

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string containing the first character of `a`, `i` is 1, `work` is True, `j` is undefined, `counter` is undefined, `t` is undefined, stdin is empty. Either `i` is less than `len(a)` or `b[i - 1]` is less than `a[i]`.**
