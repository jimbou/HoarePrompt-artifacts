The code prints the value of the variable `counter`.
Since `counter` is either 1 or greater than 1, we can't determine its exact value. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the current value of `counter`.
Output: **1 or a value greater than 1 (where the value is the current value of counter)**
