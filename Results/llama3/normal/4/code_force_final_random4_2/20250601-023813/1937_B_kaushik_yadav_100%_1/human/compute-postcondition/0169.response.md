Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string containing the characters of `a` and `b` in an alternating pattern, `i` is equal to the last index of `a`, `work` is False, `j` is 0, `counter` is 1, `t` is undefined, `stdin` is empty, and the string `ans` containing the characters of `a` and `b` in an alternating pattern is being printed. The current value of `a` at index `j + 1` is equal to the current value of `b` at index `j`.**
