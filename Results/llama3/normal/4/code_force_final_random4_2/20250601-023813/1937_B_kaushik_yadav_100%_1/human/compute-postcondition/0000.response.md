Output State: **t is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one input.**

The first line imports the readline function from the sys module, allowing for more efficient input reading. The second line reads the first input from stdin, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable t. This reduces the number of test cases in stdin by one. No other variables are affected.
