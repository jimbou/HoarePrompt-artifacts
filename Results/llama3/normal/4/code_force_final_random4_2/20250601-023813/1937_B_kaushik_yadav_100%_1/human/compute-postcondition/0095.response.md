The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` was used to access the character at index `i` of string `a` and add it to `ans`. Now, `i` is increased by 1, so the next character in string `a` will be accessed. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a string with at least `i + 1` characters, `b` is a string, `t` is greater than 1, `ans` is increased by the character at index `i - 1` of string `a`, `i` is increased by 1**
