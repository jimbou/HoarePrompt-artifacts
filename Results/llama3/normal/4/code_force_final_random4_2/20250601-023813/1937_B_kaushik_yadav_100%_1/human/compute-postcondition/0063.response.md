The code prints the value of `counter`, which is equal to the number of times the character at index `j + 1` of `a` is equal to the character at index `j` of `b` plus 1.

Since `j` is equal to the length of `a` minus 1, `j + 1` is equal to the length of `a`. However, since indexing in Python starts at 0, the character at index `j + 1` of `a` does not exist (it is out of range).

Therefore, the comparison `a[j + 1] == b[j]` will not be executed, and `counter` will be equal to 1 (the initial value of 0 plus 1).

Output: **1**
