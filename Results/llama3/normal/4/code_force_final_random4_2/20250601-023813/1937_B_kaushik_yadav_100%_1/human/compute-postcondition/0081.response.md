Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a string, `t` is greater than 1, `stdin` is empty. If `work` is True, then if `i + 1` is less than `len(a)` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`, then `work` is False. Otherwise, if `i + 1` is equal to `len(a)`, then `ans` is a string with the first character of `a` and the character at index `i` of `b`, and `i` is 0. Otherwise, `ans` is a string with the first character of `a`, `i` is 1, and either `i + 1` is not less than `len(a)` or `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`. If `work` is False, then `ans` is a string equal to the first character of `b`, `i` is 1, and `work` is False.***
