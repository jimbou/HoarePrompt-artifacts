Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string with a length of at least 2, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string that is the first character of `a` plus the character at index `i - 1` of `a` plus the character at index `i` of `a` if `work` is True, otherwise `ans` is a string consisting of the first character of `b` plus the character at index `i` of `a`, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is a boolean, `j` is 1, and the string `ans` is being printed, stdin contains no inputs. If the character at index `j + 1` of `a` is equal to the character at index `j` of `b`, then `counter` is 2. If the character at index `j + 1` of `a` is not equal to the character at index `j` of `b`, and `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', then the current values of `a[j + 1]` and `b[j]` are noted and `counter` is 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `counter` is 1.***
