Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` has at least `i + 1` characters, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string that is the first character of `a` plus the character at index `i - 1` of `a` plus the character at index `i` of `a` if `work` is True, otherwise `ans` is a string consisting of the first character of `b` plus the character at index `i` of `a`, `i` is less than the length of `a` and is increased by 1, `work` is False if the current value of `i` plus one is less than the length of `a` and the character at index `i` in `b` is less than the character at index `i` plus one in `a`, otherwise `work` is True, stdin contains no inputs.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` is still greater than 0, `n` is still an integer, `a` still has at least `i + 1` characters, `b` is still a string, `ans` is still a string that is the first character of `a` plus the character at index `i - 1` of `a` plus the character at index `i` of `a` if `work` is True, otherwise `ans` is still a string consisting of the first character of `b` plus the character at index `i` of `a`. The value of `i` is increased by 1, and `work` is still False if the current value of `i` plus one is less than the length of `a` and the character at index `i` in `b` is less than the character at index `i` plus one in `a`, otherwise `work` is still True. There are no inputs in stdin.
