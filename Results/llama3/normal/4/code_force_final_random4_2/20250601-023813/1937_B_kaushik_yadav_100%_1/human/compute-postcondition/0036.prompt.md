Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 0, n is an integer, a is a string, b is a string, ans is an empty string, i is 0, work is True, stdin contains no inputs
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a):
    if work:
        ans += a[i]
        if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
            work = False
        elif i + 1 == len(a):
            ans += b[i]
            break
        else:
            i += 1
    else:
        ans += b[i]
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string, `i` is an integer, `work` is a boolean, stdin contains no inputs. If `work` is True, then `ans` is a string that is the first character of `a` plus the character at index `i` of `b` if `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, otherwise `ans` is a string that is the first character of `a`. `i` is 0 if `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, otherwise `i` is 1. If the current value of `i` plus one is less than the length of `a` and the character at index `i` in `b` is less than the character at index `i` plus one in `a`, then `work` is False. Otherwise, `work` is True. If `work` is False, then `ans` is a string consisting of the first character of `b`, `i` is 1, and `work` is False.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` has at least `i + 1` characters, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string, `i` is less than the length of `a`, `work` is a boolean, stdin contains no inputs. If `work` is True, then `ans` is a string that is the first character of `a` plus the character at index `i` of `a` plus the character at index `i` of `b` if `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, otherwise `ans` is a string that is the first character of `a` plus the character at index `i - 1` of `a`. `i` is less than the length of `a` and is increased by 1 if `i + 1` is not equal to the length of `a`, otherwise `i` is not changed. If `work` is False, then `ans` is a string consisting of the first character of `b`, `i` is 1, and `work` is False. If the current value of `i` plus one is less than the length of `a` and the character at index `i` in `b` is less than the character at index `i` plus one in `a`, then `work` is False. Otherwise, `work` is True.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` has at least `i + 1` characters, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string that is the first character of `a` plus the character at index `i - 1` of `a` plus the character at index `i` of `a` if `work` is True, otherwise `ans` is a string consisting of the first character of `b` plus the character at index `i` of `a`. If `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, `ans` is a string that is the first character of `a` plus the character at index `i - 1` of `a` plus the character at index `i` of `a` plus the character at index `i` of `b` if `work` is True, otherwise `ans` is a string consisting of the first character of `b` plus the character at index `i` of `a` plus the character at index `i` of `b`. `i` is less than the length of `a` and is increased by 1 if `i + 1` is not equal to the length of `a`, otherwise `i` is not changed. `work` is False if the current value of `i` plus one is less than the length of `a` and the character at index `i` in `b` is less than the character at index `i` plus one in `a`, otherwise `work` is True. stdin contains no inputs.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
