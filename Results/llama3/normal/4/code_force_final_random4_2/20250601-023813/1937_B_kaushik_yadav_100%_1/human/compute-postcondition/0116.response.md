Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a string with at least 3 characters, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string and its value is being printed, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is False, `t` is greater than 1, `counter` is 1, `j` is equal to the length of `a`, `stdin` is empty**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `counter` has been set to 1. The values of all other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The string `a` still has at least 3 characters, and the string `ans` is still being printed. The variable `i` and `j` are still equal to the length of string `a`. The variable `t` is still greater than 1, and `work` is still False. The standard input `stdin` is still empty.
