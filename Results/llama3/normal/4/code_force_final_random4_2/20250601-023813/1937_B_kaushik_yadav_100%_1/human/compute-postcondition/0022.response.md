Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` has at least `i + 2` characters, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string that is the first character of `a` plus the character at index `i - 1` of `a`, `i` is less than the length of `a` and is increased by 1, `work` is a boolean, stdin contains no inputs. If `work` is True, then `i` is 1 if `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, otherwise `i` is 2. If the current value of `i` plus one is less than the length of `a` and the character at index `i - 1` in `b` is less than the character at index `i` plus one in `a`, then `work` is False. Otherwise, `work` is True. If `work` is False, then `i` is 2, and `work` is False.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` is still greater than 0, `n` is still an integer, `a` still has at least `i + 1` characters, `b` is still a string, `ans` is still a string that is the first character of `a` plus the character at index `i - 1` of `a`, `i` is still less than the length of `a` but is now increased by 1, `work` is still a boolean, and stdin still contains no inputs. The conditions for `work` being True or False are also updated accordingly.
