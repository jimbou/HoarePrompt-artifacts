Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string containing the characters of `a` and `b` in an alternating pattern, `i` is equal to the last index of `a`, `work` is False, `j` is 2, `stdin` is empty, and the string `ans` containing the characters of `a` and `b` in an alternating pattern is being printed. If `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]`, then `counter` is either 2, 3, or 4. Otherwise, if `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', then `counter` is 1. In all other cases, `counter` is either 1, 2, or 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
