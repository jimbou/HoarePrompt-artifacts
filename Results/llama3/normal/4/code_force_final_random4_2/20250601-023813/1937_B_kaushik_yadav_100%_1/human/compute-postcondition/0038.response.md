Output: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string that is the first character of `a` plus the character at index `i - 1` of `a` plus the character at index `i` of `a` if `work` is True, otherwise `ans` is a string consisting of the first character of `b` plus the character at index `i` of `a`. `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is a boolean, stdin contains no inputs, and the string `ans` is being printed**
