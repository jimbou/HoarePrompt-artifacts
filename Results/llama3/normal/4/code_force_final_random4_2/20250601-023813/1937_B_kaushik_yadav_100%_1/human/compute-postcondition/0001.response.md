According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one input. So for the loop to be executed `t` must be greater than 0.
State: **`t` is greater than 0**
