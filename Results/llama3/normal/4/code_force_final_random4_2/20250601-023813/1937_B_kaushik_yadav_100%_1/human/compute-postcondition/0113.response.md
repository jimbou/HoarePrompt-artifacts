Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `a` is a string with at least 2 characters, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string and its value is being printed, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is False, `t` is greater than 1, `stdin` is empty. If the character at index `j + 1` of `a` is equal to the character at index `j` of `b`, then `j` is 0 and `counter` is 2. If the character at index `j + 1` of `a` is not equal to the character at index `j` of `b`, then either the character at index `j + 1` of `a` is '0' and the character at index `j` of `b` is '1', in which case the current values of `a` and `b` at these indices are maintained and `j` is 0 and `counter` is 1, or the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, maintaining the current values of `a` and `b` at these indices and `j` is 0 and `counter` is 1.***
