Output State: **n is an integer, a is a string with at least 2 characters, b is a string, t is greater than 1, ans is a string equal to its original value plus the character at index i of b, i is an integer equal to its original value plus 1, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been modified by appending the character at index `i` of string `b`. The value of `i` has also been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
