Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` has at least `i + 1` characters, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string that is the first character of `a` plus the character at index `i - 1` of `a` plus the character at index `i` of `a` if `work` is True, otherwise `ans` is a string consisting of the first character of `b` plus the character at index `i` of `a`, `i` is less than the length of `a` and is increased by 1 if `i + 1` is not equal to the length of `a`, otherwise `i` is not changed, `work` is False if the current value of `i` plus one is less than the length of `a` and the character at index `i` in `b` is less than the character at index `i` plus one in `a`, otherwise `work` is True, stdin contains no inputs. If `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, `ans` is a string that is the first character of `a` plus the character at index `i - 1` of `a` plus the character at index `i` of `a` plus the character at index `i` of `b` if `work` is True, otherwise `ans` is a string consisting of the first character of `b` plus the character at index `i` of `a` plus the character at index `i` of `b`.***
