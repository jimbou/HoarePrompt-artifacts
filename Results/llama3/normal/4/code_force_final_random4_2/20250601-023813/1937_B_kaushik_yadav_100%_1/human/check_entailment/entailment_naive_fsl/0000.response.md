Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when the lexicographically smallest string is not the one that can be attained by always choosing the top or bottom path. 

For example, consider the input:

3
2
10
01

The lexicographically smallest string is "001", but the program will output "100" and "1", which is incorrect.

The issue is that the program only checks if the current character in the top path is greater than the next character in the bottom path, and if so, it switches to the bottom path. However, this is not sufficient to guarantee that the lexicographically smallest string is always chosen. 

A correct solution would need to consider all possible paths and choose the one that yields the lexicographically smallest string.
