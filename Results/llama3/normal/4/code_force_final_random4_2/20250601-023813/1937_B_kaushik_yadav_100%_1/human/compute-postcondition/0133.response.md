The code `ans += a[i]` appends the character at index `i` of string `a` to the string `ans`. Since `i` is 0, the first character of string `a` is appended to `ans`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string containing the first character of `a`, `i` is 0, `work` is True, `j` is undefined, `counter` is undefined, `t` is undefined, `stdin` is empty.**
