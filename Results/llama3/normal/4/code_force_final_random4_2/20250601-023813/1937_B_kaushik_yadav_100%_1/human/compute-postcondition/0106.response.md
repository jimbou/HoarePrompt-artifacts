The value of `counter` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `counter` was 1, so the new value of `counter` is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a string with at least 2 characters, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string and its value is being printed, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is False, `j` is 0, `counter` is 2, `t` is greater than 1, `stdin` is empty. The current value of `a` at index `j + 1` is equal to the current value of `b` at index `j`.**
