Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string with the first character of `a`, `i` is 0, `work` is True, `j` is not defined, `counter` is not defined, `t` is greater than 1, `stdin` is empty. The current value of `i` is less than the length of `a` minus 1, and the character at index `i` in `b` is less than the character at index `i + 1` in `a`.**
