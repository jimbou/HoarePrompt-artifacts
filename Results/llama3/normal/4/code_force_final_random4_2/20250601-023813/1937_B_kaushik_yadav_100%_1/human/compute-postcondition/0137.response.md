Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string containing the first character of `a`, `i` is equal to the last index of `a`, `work` is True, `j` is undefined, `counter` is undefined, `t` is undefined, `stdin` is empty. Either `i + 1` is not less than `len(a)` or `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`. The current value of `i` is equal to the length of `a`.**
