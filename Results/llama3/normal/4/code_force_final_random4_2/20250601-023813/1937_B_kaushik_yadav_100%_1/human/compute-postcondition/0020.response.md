Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` has at least `i + 1` characters, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string that is the first character of `a` plus the character at index `i` of `a`, `i` is less than the length of `a`, `work` is False, stdin contains no inputs.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables maintain their initial properties, but the value of `work` is now False. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
