Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string with the first character of `a`, `i` is 0, `work` is True, `j` is not defined, `counter` is not defined, `t` is greater than 1, `stdin` is empty. Either `i + 1` is not less than `len(a)` or `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`.***
