Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string that is the first character of `a`, `i` is 0, and `work` is True. The current value of `i` plus one is less than the length of `a` and the character at index `i` in `b` is less than the character at index `i` plus one in `a`.***
