Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer from stdin, a is a string from stdin, b is a string from stdin, ans is an empty string, i is 0, work is True, j is not defined, counter is not defined, t is greater than 1, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a):
    if work:
        ans += a[i]
        if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
            work = False
        elif i + 1 == len(a):
            ans += b[i]
            break
        else:
            i += 1
    else:
        ans += b[i]
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a string, `t` is greater than 1, `stdin` is empty. If `work` is True, then if `i + 1` is less than `len(a)` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`, then `work` is False. Otherwise, if `i + 1` is equal to `len(a)`, then `ans` is a string with the first character of `a` and the character at index `i` of `b`, and `i` is 0. Otherwise, `ans` is a string with the first character of `a`, `i` is 1, and either `i + 1` is not less than `len(a)` or `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`. If `work` is False, then `ans` is a string equal to the first character of `b`, `i` is 1, and `work` is False.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`n` is an integer, `a` is a string with at least 2 characters, `b` is a string, `t` is greater than 1, `stdin` is empty. If `work` is True, then `ans` is increased by the character at index `i` in string `a`. If `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`, then `work` is `False`. Otherwise, if `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, the state of the variables remains unchanged. Otherwise, `i` is increased by 1. If `work` is False, then `ans` is a string equal to its original value plus the character at index `i` of `b`, and `i` is an integer equal to its original value plus 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`n` is an integer, `a` is a string with at least `i + 1` characters, `b` is a string, `t` is greater than 1, `stdin` is empty. If `work` is true, then if `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`, `ans` is increased by the character at index `i` of string `a` and `work` is `False`. If `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a`, `ans` is increased by the character at index `i` of string `b`. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by the character at index `i - 1` of string `a`, and `i` is increased by 1. If `work` is false, then `ans` is updated by adding the character at index `i` of string `b`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `stdin` remains empty.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
