Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string containing the characters of `a` and `b` in an alternating pattern, `i` is equal to the last index of `a`, `work` is False, `j` is 0, `counter` is 1, `t` is undefined, `stdin` is empty, and the string `ans` containing the characters of `a` and `b` in an alternating pattern is being printed. Additionally, if the character at index `j + 1` of string `a` is '0' and the character at index `j` of string `b` is '1', then the current values of `a[j + 1]` and `b[j]` are '0' and '1' respectively. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the character at index `j + 1` of string `a` is not equal to '0' or the character at index `j` of string `b` is not equal to '1'.***
