Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `a` is a string with at least 3 characters, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string and its value is being printed, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is False, `t` is greater than 1, `stdin` is empty, `j` is equal to the length of `a`. If `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]`, then `counter` is increased by 1. If `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', then `counter` is 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
