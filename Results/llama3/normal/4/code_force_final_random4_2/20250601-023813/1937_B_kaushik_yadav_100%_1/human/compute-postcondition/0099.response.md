Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `a` is a string with at least `i + 1` characters, `b` is a string, `t` is greater than 1, `stdin` is empty. If `work` is true, then if `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`, `ans` is increased by the character at index `i` of string `a` and `work` is `False`. If `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a`, `ans` is increased by the character at index `i` of string `b`. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by the character at index `i - 1` of string `a`, and `i` is increased by 1. If `work` is false, then `ans` is updated by adding the character at index `i` of string `b`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `stdin` remains empty.***
