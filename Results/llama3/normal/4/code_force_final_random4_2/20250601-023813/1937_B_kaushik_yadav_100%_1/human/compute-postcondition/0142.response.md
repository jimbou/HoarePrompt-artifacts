Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string containing the first character of `a` and the last character of `b` if `i + 1` is equal to `len(a)`, otherwise `ans` is a string containing the first character of `a`. `i` is equal to the last index of `a` if `i + 1` is equal to `len(a)`, otherwise `i` is 1. `work` is False if the current value of `i` plus one is less than the length of `a`, and the character at index `i` in `b` is less than the character at index `i` plus one in `a`. Otherwise, `work` is True. `j` is undefined, `counter` is undefined, `t` is undefined, `stdin` is empty.***
