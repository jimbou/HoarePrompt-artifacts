Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string containing the first character of `a` and the last character of `b` if `i + 1` is equal to `len(a)`, otherwise `ans` is a string containing the first character of `a`. `i` is equal to the last index of `a` if `i + 1` is equal to `len(a)`, otherwise `i` is 1. If `work` is True, `work` remains True. If `work` is False, `work` remains False. `j` is undefined, `counter` is undefined, `t` is undefined, `stdin` is empty. If `work` is False, `ans` is a string equal to the first character of `b`, `i` is 1, and `work` is False.***
