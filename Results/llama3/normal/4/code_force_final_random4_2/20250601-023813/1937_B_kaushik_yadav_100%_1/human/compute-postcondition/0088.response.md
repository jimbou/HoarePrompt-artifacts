Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `a` is a string with at least 2 characters, `b` is a string, `t` is greater than 1, `ans` is increased by the character at index `i` in string `a`, `stdin` is empty. If `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`, then `work` is `False`. Otherwise, if `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, the state of the variables remains unchanged. Otherwise, `i` is increased by 1.***
