Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` has at least `i + 1` characters, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string that is the first character of `a` plus the character at index `i` of `a` plus the character at index `i` of `b` if `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, otherwise `ans` is a string that is the first character of `a` plus the character at index `i - 1` of `a`. `i` is less than the length of `a` and is increased by 1 if `i + 1` is not equal to the length of `a`, otherwise `i` is not changed. `work` is a boolean, stdin contains no inputs. If `work` is True, then `i` is 0 if `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, otherwise `i` is 1 or 2. If the current value of `i` plus one is less than the length of `a` and the character at index `i` in `b` is less than the character at index `i` plus one in `a`, then `work` is False. Otherwise, `work` is True. If `work` is False, then `i` is 1 or 2, and `work` is False.***
