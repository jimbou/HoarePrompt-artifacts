The code assigns the value `False` to the variable `work`. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer, `a` is a string with at least `i + 1` characters, `b` is a string, `t` is greater than 1, `ans` is increased by the character at index `i` of string `a`, and `work` is `False`.
