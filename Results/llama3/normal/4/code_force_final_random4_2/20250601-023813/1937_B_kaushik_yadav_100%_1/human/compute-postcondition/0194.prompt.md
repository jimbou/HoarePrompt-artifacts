Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one input.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = input().strip()
    b = input().strip()
    ans = ''
    i = 0
    work = True
    while i < len(a):
        if work:
            ans += a[i]
            if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
                work = False
            elif i + 1 == len(a):
                ans += b[i]
                break
            else:
                i += 1
        else:
            ans += b[i]
            i += 1
    print(ans)
    counter = 1
    for j in range(len(a) - 1):
        if a[j + 1] == b[j]:
            counter += 1
        elif a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1':
            counter = 1
        else:
            break
    print(counter)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string with a length of at least 2, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string that is the first character of `a` plus the character at index `i - 1` of `a` plus the character at index `i` of `a` if `work` is True, otherwise `ans` is a string consisting of the first character of `b` plus the character at index `i` of `a`, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is a boolean, `j` is equal to the length of `a` minus 1, `counter` is equal to the number of times the character at index `j + 1` of `a` is equal to the character at index `j` of `b` plus 1, the string `ans` is being printed, stdin contains no inputs, and the counter which is equal to the number of times the character at index `j + 1` of `a` is equal to the character at index `j` of `b` plus 1 is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string and its value is being printed, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is False, `j` is equal to the length of `a` - 1, `counter` is either 1 or greater than 1, `t` is greater than 1, `stdin` is empty, and the value of `counter` which is either 1 or greater than 1 is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a string, `ans` is a string containing the characters of `a` and `b` in an alternating pattern, `i` is equal to the last index of `a`, `work` is False, `j` is equal to the last index of `a` minus 1, `counter` is either 1, 2, or 3, `t` is undefined, `stdin` is empty, and the string `ans` containing the characters of `a` and `b` in an alternating pattern is being printed, and the value of `counter` which is either 1, 2, or 3 depending on the values of `a[j + 1]` and `b[j]` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
