The variable in the loop head is variable i and a, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i and a.  If i is less than len(a), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is 1 and a is a non-empty string, So for the loop to be executed one more time a must have at least 2 characters.
State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a string with at least 2 characters, `b` is a string, `t` is greater than 1, `stdin` is empty.**
