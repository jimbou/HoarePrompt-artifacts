You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: start and target are integers representing nodes in the tree, tree is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes, and all nodes are non-negative integers less than the number of nodes in the tree.
    queue = deque([(start, 0)])
    visited = set([start])
    while queue:
        current, dist = queue.popleft()
        
        if current == target:
            return dist
        
        for neighbor in tree[current]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing, and the queue is empty. The visited set contains all nodes that were reachable from the start node. If the target node was reachable from the start node, the function returned the distance from the start node to the target node. Otherwise, the function did not return any value.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1, indicating that the target node was not reachable from the start node.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The loop has finished executing, and the queue is empty. The visited set contains all nodes that were reachable from the start node. If the target node was reachable from the start node, the function returned the distance from the start node to the target node. Otherwise, the function did not return any value.

Case_2: The program returns -1, indicating that the target node was not reachable from the start node.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
