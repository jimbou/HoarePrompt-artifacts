Postcondition: ***The program has removed the front element from the queue and assigned its value to `current` and `dist`, and the queue is not empty. If `current` is equal to the target node, the program returns the value of `dist`, which is the distance from the starting node to the target node. Otherwise, the program continues to execute without returning any value.***
