#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, edges is a list of pairs of integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), and start is an integer between 1 and n (inclusive).
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)

    #State: n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, edges is an empty list, start is an integer between 1 and n (inclusive), tree is a dictionary with n key-value pairs: each key is an integer between 1 and n (inclusive) and is associated with a list containing all the other integers between 1 and n (inclusive).
    leaves = [node for node in tree if len(tree[node]) == 1]

        #The program returns the string 'Hermione'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines the winner of a game based on the distance from a starting node to the leaves of a tree. It constructs a tree from a list of edges, identifies the leaves, calculates the distance from the start node to each leaf using BFS, and returns 'Ron' if either distance is even, otherwise returns 'Hermione'.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: start and target are integers representing nodes in the tree, tree is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes, and all nodes are non-negative integers less than the number of nodes in the tree.
    queue = deque([(start, 0)])

    while queue:
        current, dist = queue.popleft()

            return dist

            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing, and the queue is empty. The visited set contains all nodes that were reachable from the start node. If the target node was reachable from the start node, the function returned the distance from the start node to the target node. Otherwise, the function did not return any value.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1, indicating that the target node was not reachable from the start node.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the shortest distance between two nodes in a tree. It accepts three parameters: the start node, the target node, and the tree represented as a dictionary. The function returns the distance from the start node to the target node if the target node is reachable from the start node. If the target node is not reachable, the function returns -1. The function modifies the input tree by marking all nodes reachable from the start node as visited.
