Output State: **The program returns -1, indicating that the target node was not reachable from the start node.**

In this case, the function did not return any value when the target node was not reachable from the start node, and the code explicitly returns -1. This suggests that the target node was not reachable, and the function is now returning -1 to indicate this.
