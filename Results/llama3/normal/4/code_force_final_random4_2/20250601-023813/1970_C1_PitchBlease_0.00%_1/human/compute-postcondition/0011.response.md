The code `current, dist = queue.popleft()` removes the front element from the queue and assigns its value to the variables `current` and `dist`. Since the queue must not be empty, this operation is valid.

Output State: **The program has removed the front element from the queue and assigned its value to `current` and `dist`, and the queue is not empty. If `current` is equal to the target node, the program returns the value of `dist`. Otherwise, the program continues to execute without returning any value.**
