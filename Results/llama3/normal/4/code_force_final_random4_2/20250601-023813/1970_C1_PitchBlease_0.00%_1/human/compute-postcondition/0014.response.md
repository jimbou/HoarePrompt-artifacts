Output State: **The loop has finished executing, and the queue is empty. The visited set contains all nodes that were reachable from the start node. If the target node was reachable from the start node, the function returned the distance from the start node to the target node. Otherwise, the function did not return any value.**

In natural language, this output state means that the loop has completed its execution, and the queue is now empty. The visited set contains all nodes that were reachable from the start node, indicating that the loop has explored all possible paths from the start node. If the target node was reachable from the start node, the function returned the distance from the start node to the target node. If the target node was not reachable, the function did not return any value.
