Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
This is the easy version of the problem. The difference in this version is
that t=1 and we work on an array-like tree.

Ron and Hermione are playing a game on a tree of n nodes that are initially
inactive. This tree is special because it has exactly two leaves. It can thus
be seen as an array. The game consists of t rounds, each of which starts with
a stone on exactly one node, which is considered as activated. A move consists
of picking an inactive neighbor of the node with a stone on it and moving the
stone there (thus activating this neighbor). Ron makes the first move, after
which he alternates with Hermione until no valid move is available. The player
that cannot make a move loses the round. If both players play optimally, who
wins each round of this game?

Note that all the rounds are played with the same tree; only the starting node
changes. Moreover, after each round, all active nodes are considered inactive
again.

Input

The first line contains integers n (2 \leq n \leq 2\times 10^5 ), t (t=1 ),
the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively.

The next n-1 lines contain two integers 1 \leq u, v \leq n each, corresponding
to an edge of the tree. It is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves.

The next line contains t integers 1 \leq u_1 , \dots, u_t \leq n ,
corresponding to the node where the stone is initially put.

Output

The output consists of t=1 line which is either "Ron" or "Hermione".

# Annotated Functions:
from collections import deque, defaultdict

(n, t) = map(int, input().split())
edges = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n - 1)]
starts = list(map(int, input().split()))
start = starts[0]
print(func_1(n, edges, start))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, edges is a list of pairs of integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), and start is an integer between 1 and n (inclusive).
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        
        tree[v].append(u)
        
    #State: n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, edges is an empty list, start is an integer between 1 and n (inclusive), tree is a dictionary with n key-value pairs: each key is an integer between 1 and n (inclusive) and is associated with a list containing all the other integers between 1 and n (inclusive).
    leaves = [node for node in tree if len(tree[node]) == 1]
    dist1 = bfs(start, leaves[0])
    dist2 = bfs(start, leaves[1])
    if (dist1 % 2 == 0 or dist2 % 2 == 0) :
        return 'Ron'
        #The program returns the string 'Ron'.
    else :
        return 'Hermione'
        #The program returns the string 'Hermione'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines the winner of a game based on the distance from a starting node to the leaves of a tree. It constructs a tree from a list of edges, identifies the leaves, calculates the distance from the start node to each leaf using BFS, and returns 'Ron' if either distance is even, otherwise returns 'Hermione'.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: start and target are integers representing nodes in the tree, tree is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes, and all nodes are non-negative integers less than the number of nodes in the tree.
    queue = deque([(start, 0)])
    visited = set([start])
    while queue:
        current, dist = queue.popleft()
        
        if current == target:
            return dist
        
        for neighbor in tree[current]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing, and the queue is empty. The visited set contains all nodes that were reachable from the start node. If the target node was reachable from the start node, the function returned the distance from the start node to the target node. Otherwise, the function did not return any value.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1, indicating that the target node was not reachable from the start node.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the shortest distance between two nodes in a tree. It accepts three parameters: the start node, the target node, and the tree represented as a dictionary. The function returns the distance from the start node to the target node if the target node is reachable from the start node. If the target node is not reachable, the function returns -1. The function modifies the input tree by marking all nodes reachable from the start node as visited.
