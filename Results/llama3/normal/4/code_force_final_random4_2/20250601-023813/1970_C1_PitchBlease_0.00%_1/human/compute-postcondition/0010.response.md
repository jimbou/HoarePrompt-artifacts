The only variable in the loop head is variable queue, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable queue.  If queue is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the program returns the distance of the current node that was at the front of the queue if the current node is equal to the target node. Otherwise, the program continues to execute without returning any value. This means that the current node is not equal to the target node, so the queue must not be empty.
State: **The program returns the distance of the current node that was at the front of the queue if the current node is equal to the target node. Otherwise, the program continues to execute without returning any value and queue must not be empty**
