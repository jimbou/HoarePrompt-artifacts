The only variable in the loop head is variable queue, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable queue.  If queue is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, queue is a deque containing tuples of nodes and their distances. So for the loop to be executed one more time the queue must not be empty.
State: **`start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree, `tree` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes, `queue` is a non-empty deque containing tuples of nodes and their distances, `visited` is a set containing the start node, `current` is the start node, and `dist` is 0. The current node is not equal to the target node.**
