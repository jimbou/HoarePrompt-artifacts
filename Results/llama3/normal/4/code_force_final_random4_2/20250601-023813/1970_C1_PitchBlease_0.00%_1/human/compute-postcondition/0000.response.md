Output State: **start and target are integers representing nodes in the tree, tree is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes, queue is a deque containing a tuple of the start node and 0, and visited is a set containing the start node.**

In this output state, the initial state remains valid, with start and target still being integers representing nodes in the tree, and tree still being a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes. The code introduces two new variables: queue and visited. The queue is a deque containing a tuple of the start node and 0, indicating that the start node is the first node to be processed with a distance of 0. The visited set contains the start node, indicating that it has been marked as visited.
