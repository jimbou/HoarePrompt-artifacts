Functionality: This function calculates the shortest distance between two nodes in a tree, represented as a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes. It takes three parameters: the start node, the target node, and the tree. The function returns the distance from the start node to the target node if the target node is reachable from the start node. If the target node is not reachable, the function returns -1.
