Postcondition: ***`start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree, `tree` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes, `queue` is a deque containing tuples of nodes and their distances, `visited` is a set containing the start node, `current` is the start node, and `dist` is 0. The current node is not equal to the target node.***
