Output State: **`start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree, `tree` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes, `queue` is a deque containing tuples of nodes and their distances with one less element, `visited` is a set containing the start node, `current` is the node that was at the front of the queue and `dist` is the distance of the node that was at the front of the queue. The current node is not equal to the target node.**

In this output state, the code has removed the front element from the queue and assigned its node and distance to the variables `current` and `dist`, respectively. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
