Postcondition: **`start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree, `tree` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes, `queue` is a deque containing tuples of nodes and their distances, `visited` is a set containing the start node, the current value of `current` is equal to `target`, and the current value of `dist` is 0.**
