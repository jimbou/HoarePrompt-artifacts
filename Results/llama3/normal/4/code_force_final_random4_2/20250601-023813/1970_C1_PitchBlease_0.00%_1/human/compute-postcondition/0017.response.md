Functionality: **This function calculates the shortest distance between two nodes in a tree. It accepts three parameters: the start node, the target node, and the tree represented as a dictionary. The function returns the distance from the start node to the target node if the target node is reachable from the start node. If the target node is not reachable, the function returns -1. The function modifies the input tree by marking all nodes reachable from the start node as visited.**
