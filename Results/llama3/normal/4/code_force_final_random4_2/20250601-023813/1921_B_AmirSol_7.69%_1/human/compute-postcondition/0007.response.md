Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `s1` and `s2` are strings of `n` characters consisting of '0's and '1's, `counter` is 1. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, `s1[i + 1]` is not equal to `s2[i + 1]`, and `s1[i]` is not equal to `s1[i + 1]`, then `i` is 2 and `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`. Otherwise, `i` is 1, and either `i` is not less than `n - 1`, or `s1[i + 1]` is equal to `s2[i + 1]`, or `s1[i]` is equal to `s1[i + 1]`, and `s1[i]` is equal to `s2[i]`.***
