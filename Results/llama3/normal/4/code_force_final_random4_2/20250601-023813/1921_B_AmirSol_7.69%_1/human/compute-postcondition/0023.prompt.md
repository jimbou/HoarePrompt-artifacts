Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, s1 and s2 are strings of n characters consisting of '0's and '1's, counter is 0, i is 0
Code of the loop:
while i < n:
    if s1[i] != s2[i]:
        if i < n - 1 and s1[i + 1] != s2[i + 1] and s1[i] != s1[i + 1]:
            counter += 1
            i += 2
        else:
            counter += 1
            i += 1
    else:
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive integer, `s1` and `s2` are strings of `n` characters consisting of '0's and '1's. If `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, then `counter` is 1 and `i` is either 1 or 2, and either `i` is not less than `n - 1`, or `s1[i + 1]` is equal to `s2[i + 1]`, or `s1[i]` is equal to `s1[i + 1]`, and `s1[i]` is equal to `s2[i]`. If `s1[i]` is equal to `s2[i]`, then `counter` is 0 and `i` is 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`n` is a positive integer, `s1` and `s2` are strings of `n` characters consisting of '0's and '1's. If `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, then `counter` is either 1 or 2 and `i` is either 2 or 3, and either `i` is not less than `n - 1`, or `s1[i + 1]` is equal to `s2[i + 1]`, or `s1[i]` is equal to `s1[i + 1]`, and `s1[i]` is equal to `s2[i]`. If `s1[i]` is equal to `s2[i]`, then `counter` is either 0 or 1 and `i` is either 1 or 2, and `n` is greater than 1 or 2.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`n` is a positive integer, `s1` and `s2` are strings of `n` characters consisting of '0's and '1's. If `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, then `counter` is either 1, 2, or 3 and `i` is either 2, 3, or 4, and either `i` is not less than `n - 1`, or `s1[i + 1]` is equal to `s2[i + 1]`, or `s1[i]` is equal to `s1[i + 1]`, and `s1[i]` is equal to `s2[i]`. If `s1[i]` is equal to `s2[i]`, then `counter` is either 0 or 1 and `i` is either 2 or 3, and `n` is greater than 2 or 3 and `n` is greater than 4. If `i` is less than `n - 1` and `s1[i + 1]` is not equal to `s2[i + 1]` and `s1[i]` is not equal to `s1[i + 1]`, then if `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, `counter` is either 2 or 3 and `i` is either 4 or 5, and either `i` is not less than `n - 1`, or `s1[i + 1]` is equal to `s2[i + 1]`, or `s1[i]` is equal to `s1[i + 1]`, and `s1[i]` is equal to `s2[i]`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
