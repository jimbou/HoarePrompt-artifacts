Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state of the boxes into the desired state. The function `func_1` iterates through the two binary strings `s1` and `s2` and counts the number of positions where the strings differ. It considers consecutive differing positions as a single difference, which is in line with the problem description. The function returns the total count of such differences, which represents the minimum number of operations required.

The program also handles the edge cases correctly. For example, if the two strings are identical, the function returns 0, indicating that no operations are required. If the strings differ at every position, the function returns the length of the strings divided by 2 (rounded up), which is the minimum number of operations required to transform one string into the other.

The execution summary also confirms that the function works as expected. It correctly counts the number of differing positions in the two strings and returns the total count.

Correctness: **True**
