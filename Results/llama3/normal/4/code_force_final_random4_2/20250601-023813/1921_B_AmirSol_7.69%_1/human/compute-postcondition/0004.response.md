Output State: **n is a positive integer, s1 and s2 are strings of n characters consisting of '0's and '1's, counter is 1, i is 2, the current value of s1[i] is not equal to the current value of s2[i], the current value of i is less than n - 1, the current value of s1[i + 1] is not equal to the current value of s2[i + 1], and the current value of s1[i] is not equal to the current value of s1[i + 1].**

In this final state, the value of `counter` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `i` has been incremented by 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The strings `s1` and `s2` still consist of `n` characters, which are '0's and '1's. The conditions regarding the inequality of characters at indices `i` and `i + 1` in both strings also remain valid.
