Output State: **n is a positive integer, s1 and s2 are strings of n characters consisting of '0's and '1's. If s1[i] is not equal to s2[i], then counter is 2 and i is either 2 or 3, and either i is not less than n - 1, or s1[i + 1] is equal to s2[i + 1], or s1[i] is equal to s1[i + 1], and s1[i] is equal to s2[i]. If s1[i] is equal to s2[i], then counter is 1 and i is 2, and n is greater than 1 or 2**

The code increments the value of `counter` by 1 and the value of `i` by 1. If `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, then `counter` was 1 and is now 2, and `i` was either 1 or 2 and is now either 2 or 3. If `s1[i]` is equal to `s2[i]`, then `counter` was 0 and is now 1, and `i` was 1 and is now 2. The values of `n`, `s1`, and `s2` remain unchanged.
