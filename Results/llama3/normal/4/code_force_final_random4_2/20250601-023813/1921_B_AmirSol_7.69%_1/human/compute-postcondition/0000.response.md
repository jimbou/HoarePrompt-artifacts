Output State: **n is a positive integer, s1 and s2 are strings of n characters consisting of '0's and '1's, counter is 0, i is 0**

The code initializes two new variables, `counter` and `i`, and assigns them the value 0. The initial state of `n`, `s1`, and `s2` remains unchanged, as the code does not modify these variables. The final state includes the new variables `counter` and `i` with their assigned values, along with the unchanged values of `n`, `s1`, and `s2`.
