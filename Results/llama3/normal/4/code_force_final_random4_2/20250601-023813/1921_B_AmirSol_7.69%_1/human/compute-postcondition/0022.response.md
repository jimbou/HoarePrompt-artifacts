Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `s1` and `s2` are strings of `n` characters consisting of '0's and '1's. If `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, then `counter` is either 1, 2, or 3 and `i` is either 2, 3, or 4, and either `i` is not less than `n - 1`, or `s1[i + 1]` is equal to `s2[i + 1]`, or `s1[i]` is equal to `s1[i + 1]`, and `s1[i]` is equal to `s2[i]`. If `s1[i]` is equal to `s2[i]`, then `counter` is either 0 or 1 and `i` is either 2 or 3, and `n` is greater than 2 or 3 and `n` is greater than 4. If `i` is less than `n - 1` and `s1[i + 1]` is not equal to `s2[i + 1]` and `s1[i]` is not equal to `s1[i + 1]`, then if `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, `counter` is either 2 or 3 and `i` is either 4 or 5, and either `i` is not less than `n - 1`, or `s1[i + 1]` is equal to `s2[i + 1]`, or `s1[i]` is equal to `s1[i + 1]`, and `s1[i]` is equal to `s2[i]`.***
