Output State: **n is a positive integer, s1 and s2 are strings of n characters consisting of '0's and '1's. If s1[i] is not equal to s2[i], then counter is either 2 or 3 and i is either 4 or 5, and either i is not less than n - 1, or s1[i + 1] is equal to s2[i + 1], or s1[i] is equal to s1[i + 1], and s1[i] is equal to s2[i]. If s1[i] is equal to s2[i], then counter is either 1 or 2 and i is either 3 or 4, and n is greater than 1 or 2 and n is greater than 3.**

In this output state, the value of `counter` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `i` has been incremented by 2. The conditions related to `s1`, `s2`, and `n` remain the same as in the initial state, but the values of `counter` and `i` have been updated accordingly.
