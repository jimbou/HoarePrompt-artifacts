Output State: **n is a positive integer, s1 and s2 are strings of n characters consisting of '0's and '1's, counter is 1, i is 1, the current value of s1[i] is equal to the current value of s2[i], and either i is not less than n - 1, or s1[i + 1] is equal to s2[i + 1], or s1[i] is equal to s1[i + 1].**

In this final state, the value of `counter` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `i` has been incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `s1`, and `s2` remain unchanged. The condition that the current value of `s1[i]` is not equal to the current value of `s2[i]` is no longer true, as `i` has been incremented and the new values of `s1[i]` and `s2[i]` are equal. The condition that either `i` is not less than `n - 1`, or `s1[i + 1]` is equal to `s2[i + 1]`, or `s1[i]` is equal to `s1[i + 1]` remains true.
