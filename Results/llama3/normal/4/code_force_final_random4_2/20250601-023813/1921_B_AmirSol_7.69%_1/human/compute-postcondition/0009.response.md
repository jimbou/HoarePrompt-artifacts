The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` was 0, so the new value of `i` is 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The character at index `i` in `s1` is not necessarily equal to the character at index `i` in `s2` anymore, because `i` has changed. However, we still know that `n` is a positive integer, `s1` and `s2` are strings of `n` characters consisting of '0's and '1's, and `counter` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s1` and `s2` are strings of `n` characters consisting of '0's and '1's, `counter` is 0, `i` is 1**
