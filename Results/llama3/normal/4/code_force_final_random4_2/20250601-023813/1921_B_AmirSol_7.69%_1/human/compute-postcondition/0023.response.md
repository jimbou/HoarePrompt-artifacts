Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s1` and `s2` are strings of `n` characters consisting of '0's and '1's. `counter` is a non-negative integer and `i` is equal to `n`.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations and has terminated. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop. The strings `s1` and `s2` also remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. The variable `counter` has been incremented based on the conditions within the loop and now holds a non-negative integer value, indicating the number of times the loop executed. The variable `i` has been incremented in each iteration and now equals `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations and has terminated.
