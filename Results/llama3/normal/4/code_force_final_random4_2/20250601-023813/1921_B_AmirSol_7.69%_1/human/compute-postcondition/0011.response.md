The only variable in the loop head is variable i and n, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i and n. If i is less than n, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is either 1 or 2, and n is a positive integer. For the loop to be executed one more time, i must be less than n. So, n must be greater than 1 or 2.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s1` and `s2` are strings of `n` characters consisting of '0's and '1's. If `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, then `counter` is 1 and `i` is either 1 or 2, and either `i` is not less than `n - 1`, or `s1[i + 1]` is equal to `s2[i + 1]`, or `s1[i]` is equal to `s1[i + 1]`, and `s1[i]` is equal to `s2[i]`. If `s1[i]` is equal to `s2[i]`, then `counter` is 0 and `i` is 1, and n is greater than 1 or 2**
