Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s1` and `s2` are strings of `n` characters consisting of '0's and '1's. If `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, then `counter` is either 1 or 2 and `i` is either 3 or 4, and either `i` is not less than `n - 1`, or `s1[i]` is equal to `s2[i]`, or `s1[i - 1]` is equal to `s1[i]`, and `s1[i - 1]` is equal to `s2[i - 1]`. If `s1[i]` is equal to `s2[i]`, then `counter` is either 0 or 1 and `i` is either 2 or 3, and `n` is greater than 2 or 3 and n is greater than 4**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` has been incremented by 1. The conditions related to `s1`, `s2`, `counter`, and `n` remain the same, but the value of `i` has changed. If `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, then `i` is either 3 or 4, and the other conditions related to `i` and the strings are updated accordingly. If `s1[i]` is equal to `s2[i]`, then `i` is either 2 or 3, and the other conditions related to `i` and `n` are updated accordingly.
