Output State: **n is a positive integer, s1 and s2 are strings of n characters consisting of '0's and '1's, counter is either 1 or 2 or 3 and i is either 2 or 3 or 4, and either i is not less than n - 1, or s1[i + 1] is equal to s2[i + 1], or s1[i] is equal to s1[i + 1], and s1[i] is equal to s2[i].**

The code increments the value of `counter` by 1 and increments the value of `i` by 1. The initial state of `counter` is either 1 or 2, so after the increment, it becomes either 2 or 3. The initial state of `i` is either 2 or 3, so after the increment, it becomes either 3 or 4. The conditions related to `s1`, `s2`, and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
