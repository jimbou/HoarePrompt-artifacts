Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `s1` and `s2` are strings of `n` characters consisting of '0's and '1's, `counter` is 0, `i` is 0, the current value of `s1[i]` is not equal to the current value of `s2[i]`, and either `i` is not less than `n - 1`, or `s1[i + 1]` is equal to `s2[i + 1]`, or `s1[i]` is equal to `s1[i + 1]`.***
