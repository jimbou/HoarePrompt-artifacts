The variable in the loop head is variable i and n, so we can only adjust those two.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables i and n.  If i is less than n, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is either 2 or 3 and n is a positive integer. n being a positive integer does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to n is greater than 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s1` and `s2` are strings of `n` characters consisting of '0's and '1's. If `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, then `counter` is either 1 or 2 and `i` is either 2 or 3, and either `i` is not less than `n - 1`, or `s1[i + 1]` is equal to `s2[i + 1]`, or `s1[i]` is equal to `s1[i + 1]`, and `s1[i]` is equal to `s2[i]`. If `s1[i]` is equal to `s2[i]`, then `counter` is either 0 or 1 and `i` is either 1 or 2, and `n` is greater than 1 or 2 and n is greater than 3**
