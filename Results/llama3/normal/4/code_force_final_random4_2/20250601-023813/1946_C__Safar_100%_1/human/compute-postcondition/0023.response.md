Output State: **A is a positive integer, g is a dictionary where the keys are nodes in a tree and the values are lists of neighboring nodes, k is a non-negative integer representing the number of edges to be removed from the tree, stack is a list containing a tuple (1, 1), visited is a set containing the element 1, d is a dictionary containing a key-value pair (1, 1 + d[x]), r is 0, p is 1, and x is not equal to 1 and the value of d[x] is less than A.**

In this output state, the value of d[p] has been updated to be the sum of its previous value and the value of d[x]. The other variables remain unchanged.
