#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer less than n, and edges is a list of pairs of integers (a, b) such that 1 <= a, b <= n and each pair represents an edge in the tree.
    g = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for (a, b) in edges:
        g[a].append(b)
        
        g[b].append(a)
        
    #State: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer less than n, edges is an empty list, g is a list of n+1 lists where the first list is empty and the rest are lists of integers, for every pair (a, b) in the initial edges list, g[a] contains b and g[b] contains a.
    c = 0
    l = 1
    r = n // k
    while l <= r:
        mid = l + (r - l) // 2
        
        if check(mid):
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid - 1
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer less than `n`, `edges` is an empty list, `g` is a list of `n+1` lists where the first list is empty and the rest are lists of integers, for every pair `(a, b)` in the initial `edges` list, `g[a]` contains `b` and `g[b]` contains `a`, `c` is 0, `l` is `n // k + 1`, and `r` is the largest integer `x` such that `check(x)` is false.
    print(r)
    #This is printed: the largest integer x such that check(x) is false

#Overall this is what the function does:The function constructs an adjacency list representation of a tree from a given list of edges, and then performs a binary search to find the largest integer x such that a certain condition (checked by the function check(x)) is false. It prints this largest integer x. The function takes as input a positive integer n, a positive integer k less than n, and a list of edges, and does not return any value.
