Output State: **A is a positive integer, g is a dictionary where the keys are nodes in a tree and the values are lists of neighboring nodes, and g[1] must have at least 1 neighboring node, k is a non-negative integer representing the number of edges to be removed from the tree, stack is a list containing tuples (1, 1) and (node, x), visited is a set containing the value of 1, d is a dictionary containing a key-value pair (1, 1), r is 0, the current value of x is 1, and the current value of p is 1. Additionally, the current node is not equal to p.**

In this output state, the only change is that the stack now contains an additional tuple (node, x), where node is the current node and x is the current value of x, which is 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
