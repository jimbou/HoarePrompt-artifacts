Postcondition: ***A is a positive integer, g is a dictionary where the keys are nodes in a tree and the values are lists of neighboring nodes, and g[1] must have at least 2 neighboring nodes, k is a non-negative integer representing the number of edges to be removed from the tree, visited is a set containing the value of 1, d is a dictionary containing a key-value pair (1, 1), r is 0, the current value of x is 1, and the current value of p is 1. If node is not equal to p, then stack is a list containing tuples (1, 1) and (node, x). Otherwise, stack remains the same.***
