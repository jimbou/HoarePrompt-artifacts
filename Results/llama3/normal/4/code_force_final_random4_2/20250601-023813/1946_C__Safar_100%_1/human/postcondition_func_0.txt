The function constructs an adjacency list representation of a tree from a given list of edges, and then performs a binary search to find the largest integer x such that a certain condition (checked by the function check(x)) is false. It prints this largest integer x. The function takes as input a positive integer n, a positive integer k less than n, and a list of edges, and does not return any value.
