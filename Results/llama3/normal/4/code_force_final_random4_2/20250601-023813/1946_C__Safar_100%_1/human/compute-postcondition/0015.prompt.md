Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: A is a positive integer, g is a dictionary where the keys are nodes in a tree and the values are lists of neighboring nodes, k is a non-negative integer representing the number of edges to be removed from the tree, stack is a list containing a tuple (1, 1), visited is a set containing the value of x, d is a dictionary containing a key-value pair (1, 1), r is 0, the current value of x is 1, and the current value of p is 1.
Code of the loop:
for node in g[x]:
    if node != p:
        stack.append((node, x))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: A is a positive integer, g is a dictionary where the keys are nodes in a tree and the values are lists of neighboring nodes, and g[1] must have at least 1 neighboring node, k is a non-negative integer representing the number of edges to be removed from the tree, stack is a list containing tuples (1, 1) and (node, x) if node is not equal to p, otherwise stack remains the same, visited is a set containing the value of 1, d is a dictionary containing a key-value pair (1, 1), r is 0, the current value of x is 1, and the current value of p is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *A is a positive integer, g is a dictionary where the keys are nodes in a tree and the values are lists of neighboring nodes, and g[1] must have at least 2 neighboring nodes, k is a non-negative integer representing the number of edges to be removed from the tree, visited is a set containing the value of 1, d is a dictionary containing a key-value pair (1, 1), r is 0, the current value of x is 1, and the current value of p is 1. If node is not equal to p, then stack is a list containing tuples (1, 1) and (node, x). Otherwise, stack remains the same.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *A is a positive integer, g is a dictionary where the keys are nodes in a tree and the values are lists of neighboring nodes, and g[1] must have at least 2 neighboring nodes, k is a non-negative integer representing the number of edges to be removed from the tree, visited is a set containing the value of 1, d is a dictionary containing a key-value pair (1, 1), r is 0, the current value of x is y, and the current value of p is 1. If node is not equal to p, then stack is a list containing tuples (1, 1), (node, y), and (node, x). Otherwise, stack remains the same, and node is y.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
