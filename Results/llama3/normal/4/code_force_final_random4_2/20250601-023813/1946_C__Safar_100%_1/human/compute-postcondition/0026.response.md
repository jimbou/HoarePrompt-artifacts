Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer less than `n`, `edges` is an empty list, `g` is a list of `n+1` lists where the first list is empty and the rest are lists of integers, for every pair `(a, b)` in the initial `edges` list, `g[a]` contains `b` and `g[b]` contains `a`, `c` is 0, `l` is `n // k + 1`, and `r` is the largest integer `x` such that `check(x)` is false.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the variables `n`, `k`, `edges`, `g`, and `c` remain unchanged. The variable `l` is set to `n // k + 1`, and the variable `r` is set to the largest integer `x` such that `check(x)` is false. This means that the loop continues to execute until `l` is greater than `r`, at which point it terminates. The final values of `l` and `r` depend on the behavior of the `check` function, which is not specified in the problem.
