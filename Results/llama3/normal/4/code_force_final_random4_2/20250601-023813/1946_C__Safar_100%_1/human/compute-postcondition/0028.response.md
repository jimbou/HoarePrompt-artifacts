Output: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer less than `n`, `edges` is an empty list, `g` is a list of `n+1` lists where the first list is empty and the rest are lists of integers, for every pair `(a, b)` in the initial `edges` list, `g[a]` contains `b` and `g[b]` contains `a`, `c` is 0, `l` is `n // k + 1`, and `r` is the largest integer `x` such that `check(x)` is false, and the largest integer `r` such that `check(r)` is false is being printed**
