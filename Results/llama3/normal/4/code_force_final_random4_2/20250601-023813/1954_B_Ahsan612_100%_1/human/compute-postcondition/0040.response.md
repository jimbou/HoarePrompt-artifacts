Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer and is at least 2, `ar` is a list of integers and its length is at least 3, `num` is an integer and is either the first, second or third element of `ar`, `i` is either 2, 3 or 4, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `minn` is either positive infinity, 1 or 2. If the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 3. Otherwise, if the initial value of `same` is 2, then `same` is 2. Otherwise, `same` is 1.***
