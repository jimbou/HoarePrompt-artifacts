The code prints the value of `minn`, which is the minimum of positive infinity and the length of the longest contiguous subsequence of equal elements in `ar` and 1. Since `minn` is not equal to infinity and `minn` is not equal to the length of `ar`, it means that `minn` is the length of the longest contiguous subsequence of equal elements in `ar` that is less than the length of `ar` and greater than 1.

Output: **the length of the longest contiguous subsequence of equal elements in `ar` that is less than the length of `ar` and greater than 1**
