Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `stdin` is empty. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is the third element of `ar` if `i` was 2, or the fourth element of `ar` if `i` was 3, and `i` is either 3 or 4. In both cases, `minn` is either 1 or infinity. ***
