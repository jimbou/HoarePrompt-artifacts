The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `int(input())`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `int(input())`. If `_` is less than `int(input())`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `int(input())` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `int(input())` must be greater than 1 and stdin contains at least 1 line remaining.
State: **`n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `same` is 1, `num` is an integer and is the last element of `ar`, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `_` is 1, stdin contains at least 1 line remaining, `int(input())` is at least 2. If `minn` is either infinity or equal to the length of `ar`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the minimum of positive infinity and the length of the longest contiguous subsequence of equal elements in `ar` and 1, which is `minn`, is printed.**
