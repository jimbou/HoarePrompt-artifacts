Output State: **n is an integer, ar is a list of integers, same is 1, num is an integer and is the last element of ar, minn is the minimum of positive infinity and the length of the longest contiguous subsequence of equal elements in ar, i is equal to the length of ar, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input with at least 1 line remaining.**

This output state means that after the loop has finished executing, the value of `n` remains unchanged, `ar` is still a list of integers, `same` is reset to 1, `num` is the last element of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of positive infinity and the length of the longest contiguous subsequence of equal elements in `ar`, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, and `_` is still 0. The state of `stdin` remains unchanged, with multiple lines of input and at least 1 line remaining.
