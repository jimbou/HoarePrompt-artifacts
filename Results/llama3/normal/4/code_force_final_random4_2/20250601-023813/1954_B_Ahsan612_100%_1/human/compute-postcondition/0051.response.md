Output: **`n` is an integer and is at least 2, `ar` is a list of integers, `same` is a positive integer, `num` is an integer and is the last element of `ar`, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, `_` is 1, `minn` is the minimum of its previous value and `same`, stdin is empty. The current value of `minn` is either infinity or equal to the length of `ar`, and -1 is being printed**
