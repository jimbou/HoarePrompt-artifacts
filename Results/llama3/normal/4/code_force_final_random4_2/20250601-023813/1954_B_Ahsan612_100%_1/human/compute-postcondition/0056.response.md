To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects within it.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The objects in the loop head are `_` and the `range` object created by `int(input())`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:

* `n` is an integer and is at least 2
* `ar` is a list of integers
* `same` is a positive integer
* `num` is an integer and is the last element of `ar`
* `i` is equal to `len(ar)`
* `_` is 1
* `minn` is the minimum of its previous value and `same`
* stdin is empty

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

* `_` is the loop variable, which will be incremented by 1 in each iteration. Since `_` is currently 1, it will become 2 in the next iteration.
* The `range` object created by `int(input())` will not change, as it is determined by the input value, which is not affected by the loop iteration.

The other variables (`n`, `ar`, `same`, `num`, `i`, `minn`) are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is an integer and is at least 2, `ar` is a list of integers, `same` is a positive integer, `num` is an integer and is the last element of `ar`, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, `_` is 2, `minn` is the minimum of its previous value and `same`, stdin is empty**
