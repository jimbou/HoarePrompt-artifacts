Output State: **`n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `same` is either 2 or 3, `num` is either undefined or the second element of `ar`, `i` is either 2 or 3, `minn` is either 1 or infinity**

In this output state, the value of `same` has been incremented by 1, so it can now be either 2 or 3. The other variables remain unchanged.
