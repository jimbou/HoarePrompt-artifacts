The variables in the loop head are i and ar, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `ar`. If `i` is less than `len(ar)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 3, 4 or 5, `ar` is a list of integers and its length is at least 3. `i` being either 3, 4 or 5 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is less than `len(ar)`. Also, `ar` being a list of integers and its length is at least 3 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `ar` is a list of integers and its length is greater than `i`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer and is at least 2, `ar` is a list of integers and its length is greater than `i`, `num` is an integer and is either the first, second or third element of `ar`, `i` is less than `len(ar)`, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `minn` is either positive infinity, 1 or 2. If the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 3. Otherwise, if the initial value of `same` is 2, then `same` is 2. Otherwise, `same` is 1.**
