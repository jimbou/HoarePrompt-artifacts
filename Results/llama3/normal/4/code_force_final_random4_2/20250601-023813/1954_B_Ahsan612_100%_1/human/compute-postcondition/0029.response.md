Output State: **n is an integer and is at least 2, ar is a list of integers, same is 1, num is an integer and is the first element of ar, i is 1, _ is 1, stdin is empty, minn is positive infinity.**

The code first assigns the integer value of the input to `n`, which is at least 2. Then, it assigns a list of integers from the input to `ar`. The variable `same` is set to 1, and `num` is set to the first element of `ar`. The variable `minn` is set to positive infinity, and `i` is set to 1. The variable `_` remains unchanged at 1. After the code executes, stdin is empty because two lines of input have been consumed.
