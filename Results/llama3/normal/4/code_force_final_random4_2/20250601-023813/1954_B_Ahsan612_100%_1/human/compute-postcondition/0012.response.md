Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `ar` must have at least `i+1` elements, `num` is an integer and is the element at index `i+1` of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of positive infinity and 1 if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, otherwise `minn` is the minimum of positive infinity, 1, and `same`, `i` is the original value of `i` plus 1 if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, otherwise `i` is the original value of `i` plus 2, `same` is 2 if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, otherwise `same` is 1, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input with at least 1 line remaining***
