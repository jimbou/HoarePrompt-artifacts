The code prints the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any element in the list `ar`, which is the minimum of the previous minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any element in `ar` and the number of consecutive occurrences of the last element of `ar`. This minimum number is not equal to infinity and not equal to the length of `ar`.
Output: **minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any element in the list ar (which is not equal to infinity and not equal to the length of ar)**
