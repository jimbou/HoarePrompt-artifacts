Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it not beautiful. The program iterates through the array, keeping track of the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any element. If all elements are the same or if there is only one element, it prints -1, indicating that it is impossible to make the array not beautiful. Otherwise, it prints the minimum number of elements that need to be removed.

Correctness: **True**
