Output State: **`n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of integers with more than 5 elements, `i` is either 5, 6, or 7, `num` is the third element of `ar` if `i` was 2, the fourth element of `ar` if `i` was 3, the fifth element of `ar` if `i` was 4, the sixth element of `ar` if `i` was 5, or the seventh element of `ar` if `i` was 6, `minn` is either 1, infinity, or the minimum of its original value and `same`, `same` is either 1, 2, 3, or 4 depending on whether `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it can now be 5, 6, or 7. The other variables remain unchanged, but their relationships with `i` have been updated accordingly. For example, `num` is now the fifth element of `ar` if `i` was 4, the sixth element of `ar` if `i` was 5, or the seventh element of `ar` if `i` was 6. The value of `same` still depends on whether `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`, but now `i-1` can be 4, 5, or 6.
