Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `same` is 1, `num` is an integer and is the last element of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of positive infinity and the length of the longest contiguous subsequence of equal elements in `ar` and 1, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input with at least 1 line remaining. `minn` is not equal to infinity and `minn` is not equal to the length of `ar`***
