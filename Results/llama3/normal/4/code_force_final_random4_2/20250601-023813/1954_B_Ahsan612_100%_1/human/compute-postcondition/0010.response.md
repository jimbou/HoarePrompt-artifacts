Output State: **`n` is an integer, `ar` must have at least `i+1` elements, `num` is an integer and is the element at index `i+1` of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of positive infinity and 1, `i` is the original value of `i` plus 1, `same` is 2 if the current value of `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, otherwise `same` is 3, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input with at least 1 line remaining**

In this output state, the value of `same` has been incremented by 1. If the current value of `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, then `same` is now 2, otherwise it is now 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
