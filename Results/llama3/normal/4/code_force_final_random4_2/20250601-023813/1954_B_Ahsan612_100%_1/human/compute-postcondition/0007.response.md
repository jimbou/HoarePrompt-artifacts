Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `ar` must have at least one element, `num` is an integer, `minn` is positive infinity, `i` is 1, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input with at least 1 line remaining. If the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 2. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is the element at index `i+1` of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of positive infinity and 1, and `i` is the original value of `i` plus 1.***
