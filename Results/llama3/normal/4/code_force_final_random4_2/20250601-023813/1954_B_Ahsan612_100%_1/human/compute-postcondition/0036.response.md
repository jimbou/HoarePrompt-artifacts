Output State: **`n` is an integer and is at least 2, `ar` is a list of integers and its length is at least 2, `num` is an integer and is either the first or the second element of `ar`, `i` is either 2 or 3, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `minn` is either positive infinity or 1. If the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 2. Otherwise, `same` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now either 2 or 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for `same` is still dependent on the value of `ar[i]` and `num`, but now `i` has a new value.
