Output State: **`n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `stdin` is empty. If the second element of `ar` is equal to the first element of `ar`, then `same` is 2, `i` is 2, `minn` is infinity. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is the second element of `ar`, `i` is 3, `minn` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1. If the second element of `ar` is equal to the first element of `ar`, then `i` is now 2. Otherwise, `i` is now 3. The values of the other variables remain the same.
