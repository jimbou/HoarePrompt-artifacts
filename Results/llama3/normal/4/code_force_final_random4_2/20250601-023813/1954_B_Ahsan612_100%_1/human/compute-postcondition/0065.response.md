To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `i` and `ar` (since `len(ar)` is involved in the condition).

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of `ar`. If `i` is less than the length of `ar`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 2 or 3, and `ar` has at least 2 elements.

To guarantee the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `i` is less than the length of `ar`. Since `i` can be either 2 or 3, we need to adjust the length of `ar` to be at least 3.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `stdin` is empty, `same` is either 1 or 2, `num` is either undefined or the second element of `ar`, `i` is either 2 or 3, `minn` is either 1 or infinity**
