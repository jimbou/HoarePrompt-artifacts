Output State: **`n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `same` is the number of consecutive occurrences of the last element of `ar`, `num` is the last element of `ar`, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any element in `ar`, `stdin` is empty.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `n` remains an integer, `ar` remains a list of integers, `same` is the number of consecutive occurrences of the last element of `ar`, `num` is the last element of `ar`, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any element in `ar`, and `stdin` remains empty.
