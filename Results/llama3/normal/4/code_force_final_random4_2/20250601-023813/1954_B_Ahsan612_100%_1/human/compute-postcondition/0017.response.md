Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `ar` must have at least `i+3` elements, `num` is an integer and is the element at index `i+2` of `ar`. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `minn` is the minimum of positive infinity and 1, `i` is the original value of `i` plus 2, and `same` is 3. Otherwise, `minn` is the minimum of positive infinity, 1, and `same`, `i` is the original value of `i` plus 3, and `same` is 1. In both cases, `_` is 0, and stdin contains multiple lines of input with at least 1 line remaining.***
