Output State: **`n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is either 4 or 5, `num` is the third element of `ar` if `i` was 2, or the fourth element of `ar` if `i` was 3, `minn` is either 1 or infinity, `same` is either 1, 2, or 3 depending on whether `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now either 4 or 5. The other variables remain unchanged, but the condition for `same` now depends on whether `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`, since `i` has been incremented.
