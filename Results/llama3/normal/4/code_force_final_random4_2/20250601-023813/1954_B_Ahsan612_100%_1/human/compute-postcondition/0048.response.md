Output State: **`n` is an integer and is at least 2, `ar` is a list of integers, `same` is a positive integer, `num` is an integer and is the last element of `ar`, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, `_` is 1, `minn` is the minimum of its previous value and `same`, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `minn` has been updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `same`. The previous value of `minn` was a positive integer, and `same` is also a positive integer. Therefore, the new value of `minn` is also a positive integer, and it is the minimum of the two values. The other variables remain unchanged.
