Output State: **`n` is an integer, `ar` must have at least one element, `num` is an integer and is the element at index `i+1` of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of positive infinity and 1, `i` is the original value of `i` plus 1, `same` is 1 if the current value of `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, otherwise `same` is 2, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input with at least 1 line remaining.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1. The value of `num` is still the element at index `i+1` of `ar`, and the value of `minn` is still the minimum of positive infinity and 1. The value of `same` depends on whether the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`. The values of `n`, `ar`, and `_` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple lines of input with at least 1 line remaining.
