Output State: **n is an integer, ar must have at least i+2 elements, num is an integer and is the element at index i of ar, minn is the minimum of positive infinity, 1, and same, i is the original value of i plus 3, same is 1, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input with at least 1 line remaining**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as an integer. The array `ar` still has at least `i+2` elements, but the index `i` has been incremented by 1, so `num` is now the element at index `i` of `ar`. The value of `minn` is updated to be the minimum of positive infinity, 1, and `same`, which is now 1. The variable `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now the original value of `i` plus 3. The variable `same` is reset to 1. The variable `_` remains unchanged at 0. The stdin still contains multiple lines of input with at least 1 line remaining.
