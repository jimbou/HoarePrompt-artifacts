Output State: **`n` is an integer, `ar` must have at least `i+2` elements, `num` is an integer and is the element at index `i+1` of `ar`. If `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`, then `minn` is the minimum of positive infinity and 1, `same` is 3. Otherwise, `minn` is the minimum of positive infinity, 1, and `same`, and `same` is 1. In both cases, `_` is 0, `i` is the original value of `i` plus 1, and stdin contains multiple lines of input with at least 1 line remaining.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, and the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to `minn`, `same`, and `_` are still valid, but the index `i` has been updated. The array `ar` still has at least `i+2` elements, and `num` is still the element at index `i+1` of `ar`. The stdin still contains multiple lines of input with at least 1 line remaining.
