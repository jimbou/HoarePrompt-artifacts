Output State: **n is an integer, ar must have at least i+1 elements, num is an integer and is the element at index i of ar, minn is the minimum of positive infinity, 1, and same, i is the original value of i plus 2, same is 1, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input with at least 1 line remaining**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, making it the original value of `i` plus 2. The value of `num` has been updated to the element at index `i` of `ar`, which is the new value of `i` after the increment. The value of `minn` has been updated to the minimum of positive infinity, 1, and the original value of `same`. The value of `same` has been reset to 1. The values of `n`, `ar`, and `_` remain unchanged. Stdin still contains multiple lines of input with at least 1 line remaining.
