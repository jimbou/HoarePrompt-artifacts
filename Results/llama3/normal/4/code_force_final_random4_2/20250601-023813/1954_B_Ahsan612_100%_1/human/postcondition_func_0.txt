This function reads multiple lines of input from stdin, where the first line contains the number of test cases, and each test case consists of a line with an integer n followed by a line with n integers. It then finds the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any element in each test case and prints this minimum number, or -1 if all elements are the same or if there is only one element.
