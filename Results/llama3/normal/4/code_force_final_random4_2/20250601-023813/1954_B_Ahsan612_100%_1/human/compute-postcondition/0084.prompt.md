Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4). Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5), and the line after that contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
    same = 1
    num = ar[0]
    minn = inf
    i = 1
    while i < len(ar):
        if ar[i] == num:
            same += 1
        else:
            i += 1
            num = ar[i]
            minn = min(minn, same)
            same = 1
        i += 1
    minn = min(minn, same)
    if minn == inf or minn == len(ar):
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(minn)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `same` is 1, `num` is an integer and is the last element of `ar`, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input with at least 1 line remaining. If `minn` is either infinity or equal to the length of `ar`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the minimum of positive infinity and the length of the longest contiguous subsequence of equal elements in `ar` and 1, which is `minn`, is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer and is at least 2, `ar` is a list of integers, `same` is a positive integer, `num` is an integer and is the last element of `ar`, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, `_` is 1, `minn` is the minimum of its previous value and `same`, stdin is empty. If `minn` is infinity or equal to the length of `ar`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the value of `minn` which is less than infinity and not equal to the length of `ar` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `same` is the number of consecutive occurrences of the last element of `ar`, `num` is the last element of `ar`, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of the previous minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any element in `ar` and the number of consecutive occurrences of the last element of `ar`, `stdin` is empty. If `minn` is either infinity or equal to the length of `ar`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any element in `ar` which is `minn` is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
