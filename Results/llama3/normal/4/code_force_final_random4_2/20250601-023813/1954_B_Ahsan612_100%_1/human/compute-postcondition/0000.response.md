According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and the input. If the input has at least 1 line, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains multiple lines of input. So for the loop to be executed  the input must have at least 1 line and the variable `_` is 0.
State: **stdin contains multiple lines of input that must have at least 1 line, `_` is 0**
