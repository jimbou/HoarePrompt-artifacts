The code block increments the value of `i` by 1, updates the value of `num` to the element at the new index `i` in the list `ar`, updates the value of `minn` to the minimum between its current value and `same`, and resets the value of `same` to 1.

Output State: **n is an integer, ar has at least one element, same is 1, num is the element at index i+1 of ar, minn is the minimum of positive infinity and 1, i is the original value of i plus 1, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input with at least 1 line remaining.**
