Output State: **n is an integer and is at least 2, ar is a list of integers and its length is at least 3, num is an integer and is either the first, second or third element of ar, i is either 3 or 4, _ is 1, stdin is empty, minn is either positive infinity, 1 or 2, same is 1.**

The code increments `i` by 1, making it either 3 or 4. Then, it updates `num` to be the element of `ar` at the new index `i`, which can be either the first, second, or third element of `ar`. The value of `minn` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `same`, which can result in `minn` being positive infinity, 1, or 2. Finally, `same` is reset to 1. The values of `n`, `ar`, `_`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
