Based on the precondition, we can determine the value of `minn` as follows:

* `minn` is less than `inf` (infinity) and not equal to `len(ar)`.
* Since `inf` is a very large number, `minn` must be a finite number.
* `minn` is not equal to `len(ar)`, which means it is not equal to the length of the list `ar`.

However, we cannot determine the exact value of `minn` because the precondition does not provide enough information. We only know that it is a finite number less than infinity and not equal to the length of the list `ar`.

Therefore, the output will be a finite number, but we cannot specify its exact value.

Output: **a finite number less than infinity and not equal to the length of the list ar**
