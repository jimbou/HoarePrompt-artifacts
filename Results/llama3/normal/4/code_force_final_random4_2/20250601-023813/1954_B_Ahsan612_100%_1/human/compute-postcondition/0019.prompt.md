Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, ar is a list of integers, same is 1, num is an integer, minn is positive infinity, i is 1, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input with at least 1 line remaining
Code of the loop:
while i < len(ar):
    if ar[i] == num:
        same += 1
    else:
        i += 1
        num = ar[i]
        minn = min(minn, same)
        same = 1
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `ar` must have at least one element, `num` is an integer and is the element at index `i+1` of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of positive infinity and 1, `i` is the original value of `i` plus 1, `same` is 1 if the current value of `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, otherwise `same` is 2, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input with at least 1 line remaining.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is an integer, `ar` must have at least `i+2` elements, `num` is an integer and is the element at index `i+2` of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of positive infinity and 1 if `ar[i+1]` is equal to `num`, otherwise `minn` is the minimum of positive infinity, 1, and `same`, `i` is the original value of `i` plus 2, `same` is 2 if `ar[i+1]` is equal to `num`, otherwise `same` is 1, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input with at least 1 line remaining
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is an integer, `ar` must have at least `i+2` elements, `num` is an integer and is the element at index `i+1` of `ar`. If `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`, then `minn` is the minimum of positive infinity and 1, `same` is 3. Otherwise, `minn` is the minimum of positive infinity, 1, and `same`, and `same` is 1. In both cases, `_` is 0, `i` is the original value of `i` plus 1, and stdin contains multiple lines of input with at least 1 line remaining.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
