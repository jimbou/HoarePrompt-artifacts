The variable in the loop head is `i` and `ar`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `ar`. If `i` is less than `len(ar)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the original value of `i` plus 2, `ar` must have at least `i+2` elements. `ar` having at least `i+2` elements does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `ar` must have at least `i+3` elements. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer, `ar` must have at least `i+3` elements, `num` is an integer and is the element at index `i+2` of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of positive infinity and 1 if `ar[i+1]` is equal to `num`, otherwise `minn` is the minimum of positive infinity, 1, and `same`, `i` is the original value of `i` plus 2, `same` is 2 if `ar[i+1]` is equal to `num`, otherwise `same` is 1, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input with at least 1 line remaining**
