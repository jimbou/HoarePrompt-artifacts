Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `stdin` is empty. If the second element of `ar` is equal to the first element of `ar`, then `same` is 2, `i` is 1, `minn` is infinity. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is the second element of `ar`, `i` is 2, `minn` is 1.***
