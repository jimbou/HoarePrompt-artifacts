Output State: **`n` is an integer, `ar` must have at least `i+2` elements, `num` is an integer and is the element at index `i+2` of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of positive infinity and 1 if `ar[i+1]` is equal to `num`, otherwise `minn` is the minimum of positive infinity, 1, and `same`, `i` is the original value of `i` plus 2, `same` is 2 if `ar[i+1]` is equal to `num`, otherwise `same` is 1, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input with at least 1 line remaining**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, and the other variables have been updated accordingly. The value of `minn` and `same` depend on whether `ar[i+1]` is equal to `num`. The value of `n` and the contents of `ar` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple lines of input with at least 1 line remaining.
