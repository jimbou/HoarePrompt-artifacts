To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the loop condition: `i < len(ar)`. This means we need to focus on adjusting the states of `i` and `ar` since these are the variables involved in the loop condition.

Given the initial states:
- `n` is an integer
- `ar` is a list of integers
- `same` is 1
- `num` is an integer
- `minn` is positive infinity
- `i` is 1
- `_` is 0
- `stdin` contains multiple lines of input with at least 1 line remaining

We need to adjust the state of `ar` and `i` to ensure the loop can execute at least once. Since `i` is already 1, we need to ensure that `ar` has at least one element to satisfy the condition `i < len(ar)`.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
- `n` is an integer
- `ar` must have at least one element
- `same` is 1
- `num` is an integer
- `minn` is positive infinity
- `i` is 1
- `_` is 0
- `stdin` contains multiple lines of input with at least 1 line remaining

State: **`n` is an integer, `ar` must have at least one element, `same` is 1, `num` is an integer, `minn` is positive infinity, `i` is 1, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input with at least 1 line remaining**
