Output State: **n is an integer, ar is a list of integers, same is 1, num is the first element of ar, i is 1, minn is infinity, stdin is empty**

The code snippet modifies the initial state in the following ways:

*   The first line assigns a new integer value to `n`, overwriting its previous value.
*   The second line assigns a new list of integers to `ar`, overwriting its previous value.
*   The third line assigns the value 1 to `same`, overwriting its previous value.
*   The fourth line assigns the first element of `ar` to `num`, overwriting its previous value.
*   The fifth line assigns the value infinity to `minn`, overwriting its previous value.
*   The sixth line assigns the value 1 to `i`, overwriting its previous value.

The values of `_` are not affected by the code snippet, so they remain the same. Stdin is empty after the execution of the code snippet.
