Output State: **`n` is an integer and is at least 2, `ar` is a list of integers and its length is at least 3, `num` is an integer and is either the first, second or third element of `ar`, `i` is either 3, 4 or 5, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `minn` is either positive infinity, 1 or 2. If the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 3. Otherwise, if the initial value of `same` is 2, then `same` is 2. Otherwise, `same` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it can now be 3, 4, or 5. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `ar` still has at least 3 elements, and `num` is still one of the first three elements of `ar`. The value of `n` is still at least 2, and `_` is still 1. The `stdin` is still empty, and `minn` is still either positive infinity, 1, or 2. The value of `same` depends on whether the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, and its initial value.
