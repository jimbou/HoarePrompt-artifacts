Output State: **`n` is an integer and is at least 2, `ar` is a list of integers and its length is greater than `i`, `num` is an integer and is either the first, second or third element of `ar`, `i` is less than `len(ar)`, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `minn` is either positive infinity, 1 or 2. If the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 4. Otherwise, if the initial value of `same` is 2, then `same` is 3. Otherwise, `same` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `same` has been incremented by 1. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is now 4. If the initial value of `same` was 2, then it is now 3. Otherwise, `same` is now 2. The values of the other variables remain the same.
