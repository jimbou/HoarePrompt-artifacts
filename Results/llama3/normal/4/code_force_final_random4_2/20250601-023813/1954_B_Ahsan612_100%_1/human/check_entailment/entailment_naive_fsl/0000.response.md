Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input array has only one element. In this case, the program will output -1, but the correct output should be -1 only if it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that it stops being beautiful. If the array has only one element, it is already not beautiful, so the correct output should be 0.

For example, if the input is:

1
1

The program will output -1, but the correct output should be 0.

The program also does not work correctly when the input array has two elements and they are the same. In this case, the program will output -1, but the correct output should be 1.

For example, if the input is:

2
2 2

The program will output -1, but the correct output should be 1.

The program also does not work correctly when the input array has two elements and they are different. In this case, the program will output 1, but the correct output should be 0.

For example, if the input is:

2
1 2

The program will output 1, but the correct output should be 0.

The program also does not work correctly when the input array has more than two elements and they are all the same. In this case, the program will output -1, but the correct output should be the length of the array minus one.

For example, if the input is:

3
2 2 2

The program will output -1, but the correct output should be 2.

The program also does not work correctly when the input array has more than two elements and they are not all the same. In this case, the program will output the minimum length of the subarrays that have the same elements, but the correct output should be the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array not beautiful.

For example, if the input is:

5
1 2 1 2 1

The program will output 1, but the correct output should be 1.

The program also does not work correctly when the input array has more than two elements and they are all different. In this case, the program will output 1, but the correct output should be 0.

For example, if the input is:

5
1 2 3 4 5

The program will output 1, but the correct output should be 0.

The program also does not work correctly when the input array has more than two elements and they are all the same except for one element. In this case, the program will output the minimum length of the subarrays that have the same elements, but the correct output should be the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array not beautiful.

For example, if the input is:

7
3 3 3 5 3 3 3

The program will output 3, but the correct output should be 3.

The program also does not work correctly when the input array has more than two elements and they are all the same except for two elements. In this case, the program will output the minimum length of the subarrays that have the same elements, but the correct output should be the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array not beautiful.

For example, if the input is:

7
3 3 3 5 5 3 3

The program will output 3, but the correct output should be 2.

The program also does not work correctly when the input array has more than two elements and they are all the same except for three elements. In this case, the program will output the minimum length of the subarrays that have the same elements, but the correct output should be the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array not beautiful.

For example, if the input is:

7
3 3 3 5 5 5 3

The program will output 3, but the correct output should be 1.

The program also does not work correctly when the input array has more than two elements and they are all the same except for four elements. In this case, the program will output the minimum length of the subarrays that have the same elements, but the correct output should be the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array not beautiful.

For example, if the input is:

7
3 3 3 5 5 5 5

The program will output 3, but the correct output should be 0.

The program also does not work correctly when the input array has more than two elements and they are all the same except for five elements. In this case, the program will output the minimum length of the subarrays that have the same elements, but the correct output should be the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array not beautiful.

For example, if the input is:

7
3 3 3 5 5 5 5 5

The program will output 3, but the correct output should be -1.

The program also does not work correctly when the input array has more than two elements and they are all the same except for six elements. In this case, the program will output the minimum length of the subarrays that have the same elements, but the correct output should be the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array not beautiful.

For example, if the input is:

7
3 3 3 5 5 5 5 5 5

The program will output 3, but the correct output should be -1.

The program also does not work correctly when the input array has more than two elements and they are all the same except for seven elements. In this case, the program will output the minimum length of the subarrays that have the same elements, but the correct output should be the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array not beautiful.

For example, if the input is:

7
3 3 3 5 5 5 5 5 5 5

The program will output 3, but the correct output should be -1.

The program also does not work correctly when the input array has more than two elements and they are all the same except for eight elements. In this case, the program will output the minimum length of the subarrays that have the same elements, but the correct output should be the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array not beautiful.

For example, if the input is:

7
3 3 3 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5

The program will output 3, but the correct output should be -1.

The program also does not work correctly when the input array has more than two elements and they are all the same except for nine elements. In this case, the program will output the minimum length of the subarrays that have the same elements, but the correct output should be the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array not beautiful.

For example, if the input is:

7
3 3 3 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5

The program will output 3, but the correct output should be -1.

The program also does not work correctly when the input array has more than two elements and they are all the same except for ten elements. In this case, the program will output the minimum length of the subarrays that have the same elements, but the correct output should be the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array not beautiful.

For example, if the input is:

7
3 3 3 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5

The program will output 3, but the correct output should be -1.

The program also does not work correctly when the input array has more than two elements and they are all the same except for eleven elements. In this case, the program will output the minimum length of the subarrays that have the same elements, but the correct output should be the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array not beautiful.

For example, if the input is:

7
3 3 3 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5

The program will output 3, but the correct output should be -1.

The program also does not work correctly when the input array has more than two elements and they are all the same except for twelve elements. In this case, the program will output the minimum length of the subarrays that have the same elements, but the correct output should be the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array not beautiful.

For example, if the input is:

7
3 3 3 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5

The program will output 3, but the correct output should be -1.

The program also does not work correctly when the input array has more than two elements and they are all the same except for thirteen elements. In this case, the program will output the minimum length of the subarrays that have the same elements, but the correct output should be the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array not beautiful.
