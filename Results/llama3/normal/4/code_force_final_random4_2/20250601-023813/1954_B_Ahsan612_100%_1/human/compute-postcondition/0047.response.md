Output State: **n is an integer and is at least 2, ar is a list of integers, same is a positive integer, num is an integer and is the last element of ar, i is equal to len(ar), _ is 1, stdin is empty, minn is a positive integer.**

This output state indicates that the loop has finished executing all its iterations. The variable `i` has reached the end of the list `ar`, and the variable `num` is now the last element of `ar`. The variable `same` is a positive integer, indicating the number of consecutive occurrences of the last element in `ar`. The variable `minn` is a positive integer, representing the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any element in `ar`. The other variables, `n`, `_`, and `stdin`, remain unchanged.
