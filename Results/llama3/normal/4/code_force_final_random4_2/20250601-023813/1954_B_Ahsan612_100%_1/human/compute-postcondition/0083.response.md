Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `same` is the number of consecutive occurrences of the last element of `ar`, `num` is the last element of `ar`, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of the previous minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any element in `ar` and the number of consecutive occurrences of the last element of `ar`, `stdin` is empty. If `minn` is either infinity or equal to the length of `ar`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any element in `ar` which is `minn` is printed.***
