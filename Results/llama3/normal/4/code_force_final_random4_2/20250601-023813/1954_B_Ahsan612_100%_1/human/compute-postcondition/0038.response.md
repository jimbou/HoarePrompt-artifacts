Output State: **`n` is an integer and is at least 2, `ar` is a list of integers and its length is at least 3, `num` is an integer and is either the first or the second element of `ar`, `i` is either 2 or 3, `_` is 1, `minn` is either positive infinity or 1, `same` is either 2 or 3. If the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 3. Otherwise, `same` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `same` has been incremented by 1. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is now 3; otherwise, it is 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
