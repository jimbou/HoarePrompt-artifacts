According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `ar`. If `i` is less than the length of `ar`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 2 or 3, and the length of `ar` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than the length of `ar`, so the length of `ar` must be at least 3 if `i` is 2, or `i` must be 2 if the length of `ar` is 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer and is at least 2, `ar` is a list of integers and its length is at least 3, `num` is an integer and is either the first or the second element of `ar`, `i` is either 2 or 3, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `minn` is either positive infinity or 1. If the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 2. Otherwise, `same` is 1.**
