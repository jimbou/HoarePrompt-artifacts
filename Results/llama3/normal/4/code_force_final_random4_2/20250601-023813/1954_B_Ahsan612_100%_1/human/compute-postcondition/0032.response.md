Output State: **`n` is an integer and is at least 2, `ar` is a list of integers and its length is at least 2, `same` is 2, `num` is an integer and is the first element of `ar`, `i` is 1, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `minn` is positive infinity. The current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`**

The value of `same` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 2. The values of the other variables are not affected. The output state includes all the information of the precondition that is still valid after the code has been executed, with the updated value of `same`.
