Output State: **`n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of integers with more than 5 elements, `i` is either 4 or 5, `num` is the third element of `ar` if `i` was 2, or the fourth element of `ar` if `i` was 3, `minn` is either 1 or infinity, `same` is either 2, 3, or 4 depending on whether `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`.**

In this output state, the value of `same` has been incremented by 1, so it can now be 2, 3, or 4, depending on whether `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
