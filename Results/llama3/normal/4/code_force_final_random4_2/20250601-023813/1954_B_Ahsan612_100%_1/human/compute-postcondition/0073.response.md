Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of integers with more than 5 elements, `i` is either 4, 5, or 6, `num` is the third element of `ar` if `i` was 2, the fourth element of `ar` if `i` was 3, the fifth element of `ar` if `i` was 4, or the sixth element of `ar` if `i` was 5, `minn` is either 1, infinity, or the minimum of its original value and `same`, `same` is either 1, 2, 3, or 4 depending on whether `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`.***
