Output State: **`n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `same` is the number of consecutive occurrences of the last element of `ar`, `num` is the last element of `ar`, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any element in `ar`, `_` is equal to the number of iterations of the loop, stdin is empty. If `minn` is either infinity or equal to the length of `ar`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any element in `ar` which is `minn` is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has processed all the input lines, and the variables `n`, `ar`, `same`, `num`, `i`, and `minn` have their final values. The variable `_` is equal to the number of iterations of the loop, and the standard input `stdin` is empty. If the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any element in `ar` is either infinity or equal to the length of `ar`, then the output is -1. Otherwise, the output is the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any element in `ar`, which is stored in `minn`.
