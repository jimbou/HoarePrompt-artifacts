Output State: **`n` is an integer, `ar` must have at least `i+1` elements, `num` is an integer and is the element at index `i` of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of positive infinity and 1 if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, otherwise `minn` is the minimum of positive infinity, 1, and `same`, `i` is the original value of `i` plus 2, `same` is 3 if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, otherwise `same` is 2, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input with at least 1 line remaining**

In this output state, the value of `same` has been incremented by 1. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is now 3; otherwise, `same` is now 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple lines of input with at least 1 line remaining.
