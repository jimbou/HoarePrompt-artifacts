Output State: **n is an integer, ar is a list of integers with more than 5 elements, i is either 5 or 6, num is the fifth element of ar if i was 4, or the sixth element of ar if i was 5, minn is either 1 or the minimum of its original value and same, same is 1.**

The code increments `i` by 1, making it either 5 or 6. Then, it assigns the value of the element at index `i` in `ar` to `num`. Since `i` is now either 5 or 6, `num` becomes the fifth or sixth element of `ar`, respectively. The third line updates `minn` to be the minimum of its original value and `same`, which can be either 1 or the original value of `minn` if `same` was greater than 1. Finally, `same` is reset to 1.
