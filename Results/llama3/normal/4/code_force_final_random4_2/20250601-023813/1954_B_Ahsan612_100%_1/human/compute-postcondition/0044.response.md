Output State: **n is an integer and is at least 2, ar is a list of integers and its length is greater than i, num is an integer and is the (i+1)th element of ar, i is less than len(ar) and is one more than its initial value, _ is 1, stdin is empty, minn is either positive infinity, 1 or 2 and is either its initial value or same, same is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it. The list `ar` also remains unchanged, but the index `i` is incremented by 1. The value of `num` is updated to be the (i+1)th element of `ar`. The value of `_` remains 1 as it is not modified by the code. The value of `minn` is updated to be the minimum of its initial value and the initial value of `same`. The value of `same` is reset to 1.
