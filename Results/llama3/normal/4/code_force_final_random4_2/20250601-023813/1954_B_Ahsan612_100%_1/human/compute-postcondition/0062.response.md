Output State: **n is an integer, ar is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, same is 1, num is the second element of ar, i is 2, minn is 1, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as an integer. The list `ar` still contains at least 2 elements, with its composition unchanged except for the fact that we now know `num` is the second element of `ar`. The variable `same` has been reset to 1. The value of `num` has been updated to be the second element of `ar`, which is different from the first element. The index `i` has been incremented to 2. The variable `minn`, initially infinity, has been updated to 1, which is the minimum value between its original value and the value of `same` (which was 1). The state of `stdin` remains empty, as no input operations were performed.
