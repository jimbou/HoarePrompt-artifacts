Output State: **`n` is an integer, `ar` must have at least one element, `same` is 2, `num` is an integer, `minn` is positive infinity, `i` is 1, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input with at least 1 line remaining. The current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`**

In this output state, the value of `same` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `same` being 2. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and conditions. The stdin still contains multiple lines of input with at least one line remaining, and the relationship between `ar[i]` and `num` remains the same.
