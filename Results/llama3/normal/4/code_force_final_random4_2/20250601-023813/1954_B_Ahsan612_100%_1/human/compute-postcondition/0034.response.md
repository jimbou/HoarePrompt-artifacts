Output State: **n is an integer and is at least 2, ar is a list of integers and its length is at least 2, same is 1, num is the second element of ar, i is 2, _ is 1, stdin is empty, minn is 1.**

The code increments `i` by 1, making it 2. It then assigns the second element of `ar` to `num`. Since the second element of `ar` is not equal to the first element of `ar`, `num` is now different from its initial value. The code then assigns the minimum value between `minn` and `same` to `minn`. Since `minn` is initially positive infinity and `same` is 1, `minn` becomes 1. Finally, the code assigns 1 to `same`. No other variables are affected.
