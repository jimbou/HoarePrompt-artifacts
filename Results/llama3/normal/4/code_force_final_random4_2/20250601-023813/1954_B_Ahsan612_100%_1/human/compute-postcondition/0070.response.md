The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `ar`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `ar`.  If `i` is less than `len(ar)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 4 or 5, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements. For the loop to be executed one more time `i` must be less than `len(ar)`, so `len(ar)` must be greater than 5.
State: **`n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of integers with more than 5 elements, `i` is either 4 or 5, `num` is the third element of `ar` if `i` was 2, or the fourth element of `ar` if `i` was 3, `minn` is either 1 or infinity, `same` is either 1, 2, or 3 depending on whether `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`.**
