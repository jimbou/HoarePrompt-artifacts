To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `ar`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `i < len(ar)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the original value of `i` plus 1, and `ar` must have at least one element.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the state of `ar` to have at least one more element than the current value of `i`. This is because `i` has already been incremented by 1, so we need to ensure that `ar` has enough elements to satisfy the condition `i < len(ar)`.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer, `ar` must have at least `i+1` elements, `num` is an integer and is the element at index `i+1` of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of positive infinity and 1, `i` is the original value of `i` plus 1, `same` is 1 if the current value of `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, otherwise `same` is 2, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input with at least 1 line remaining**
