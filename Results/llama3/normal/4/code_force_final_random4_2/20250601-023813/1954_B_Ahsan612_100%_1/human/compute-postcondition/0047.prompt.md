Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer and is at least 2, ar is a list of integers, same is 1, num is an integer and is the first element of ar, i is 1, _ is 1, stdin is empty, minn is positive infinity.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(ar):
    if ar[i] == num:
        same += 1
    else:
        i += 1
        num = ar[i]
        minn = min(minn, same)
        same = 1
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer and is at least 2, `ar` is a list of integers and its length is at least 2, `num` is an integer and is either the first or the second element of `ar`, `i` is either 2 or 3, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `minn` is either positive infinity or 1. If the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 2. Otherwise, `same` is 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is an integer and is at least 2, `ar` is a list of integers and its length is at least 3, `num` is an integer and is either the first, second or third element of `ar`, `i` is either 3, 4 or 5, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `minn` is either positive infinity, 1 or 2. If the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 3. Otherwise, if the initial value of `same` is 2, then `same` is 2. Otherwise, `same` is 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is an integer and is at least 2, `ar` is a list of integers and its length is greater than `i`, `num` is an integer and is either the first, second or third element of `ar`, `i` is one more than its initial value and is less than `len(ar)`, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `minn` is either positive infinity, 1, 2, or `same`, `same` is either 1, 2, 3, or 4.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
