Output State: **`n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `same` is 2, `num` is the first element of `ar`, `i` is 1, `minn` is infinity, `ar[i]` is equal to `num`**.

In this output state, the value of `same` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `same` being 2. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and relationships.
