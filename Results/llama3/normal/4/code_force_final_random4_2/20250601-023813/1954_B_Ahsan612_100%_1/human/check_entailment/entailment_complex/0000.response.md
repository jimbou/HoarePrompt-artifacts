Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it not beautiful.

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the input from stdin, parsing the number of test cases, the size of each array, and the elements of each array.

2. It initializes variables to keep track of the number of consecutive occurrences of the same element (`same`), the current element (`num`), and the minimum number of consecutive occurrences seen so far (`minn`).

3. The program then iterates through each array, updating the `same` count whenever it encounters the same element, and updating `minn` whenever it encounters a different element.

4. After iterating through each array, it updates `minn` one last time to account for the last sequence of consecutive elements.

5. Finally, it checks if `minn` is either infinity (indicating that all elements were the same) or equal to the length of the array (indicating that there was only one element). If either condition is true, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the minimum number of consecutive occurrences, which is the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array not beautiful.

Correctness: **True**
