Output State: **`n` is an integer and is at least 2, `ar` is a list of integers and its length is greater than `i`, `num` is an integer and is either the first, second or third element of `ar`, `i` is one more than its initial value and is less than `len(ar)`, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `minn` is either positive infinity, 1, 2, or `same`, `same` is either 1, 2, 3, or 4.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, and its new value is one more than its initial value. The value of `num` is still either the first, second, or third element of `ar`. The value of `minn` is either its initial value or `same`, and the value of `same` is either 1, 2, 3, or 4, depending on the initial values of `ar[i]` and `same`. The values of `n`, `ar`, and `_` remain unchanged, and `stdin` is still empty.
