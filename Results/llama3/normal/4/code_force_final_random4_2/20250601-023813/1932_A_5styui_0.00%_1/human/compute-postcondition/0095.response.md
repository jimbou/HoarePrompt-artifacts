Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `s` is 1 if the first character of `b` is '@', otherwise `s` is 0. `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, `i` is 2, `d` is an integer equal to the input value, `b` is a string that must have at least 3 characters. If the character at index `j` of `b` is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if the character at index `j+1` of `b` is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `j` is 3.***
