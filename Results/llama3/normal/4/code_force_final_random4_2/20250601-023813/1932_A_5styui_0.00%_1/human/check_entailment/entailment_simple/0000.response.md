Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The issue lies in the way it handles the case when it encounters a '*' (thorn) in the path. The program breaks out of the inner loop as soon as it encounters a '*', which means it will not count any coins that come after the first '*'. However, according to the problem description, it is possible to move over a '*' if the destination cell is not a '*'. Therefore, the program should not break out of the loop when it encounters a '*'. Instead, it should continue to the next character and check if it is a '@' (coin) or not.

Correctness: **False**
