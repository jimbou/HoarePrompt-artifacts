Output: **a is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, s is 0 or a positive integer, stdin contains t-2 test cases, i is 0, d is an integer, b is a string, j is equal to the length of string b. If the string b contains '@', then s is equal to the number of '@' in string b. If the string b contains '*', then if the string b is not empty, we are no longer inside the innermost loop or conditional statement. If the string b is empty, if the character at index j + 1 in string b is '*', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes occur, and the value of s is being printed**
