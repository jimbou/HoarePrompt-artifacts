Output State: **a is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, s is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of n characters, where each character is either '.', '@', or '*'.**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `a`. Since `a` is between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `a` becomes an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive. The second line assigns the value of 0 to `s`. No other variables are affected.
