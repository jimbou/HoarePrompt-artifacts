Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `s` is either 1, 2 or 3 depending on whether the first character of `b` is '@' or not, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, `i` is 2, `d` is an integer equal to the input value, `b` is a string that must have at least 4 characters, `j` is 3. If the character at index `j` in `b` is '@', no changes are made. If the character at index `j` in `b` is not '@', then if the first character of `b` is '@' or the character at index `j + 1` in `b` is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
