Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `s` is 1, 2 or 3, `stdin` contains t-4 or t-5 test cases, `i` is 1, `d` is an integer, `b` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, `j` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been incremented by 1, so it can now be 1, 2, or 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
