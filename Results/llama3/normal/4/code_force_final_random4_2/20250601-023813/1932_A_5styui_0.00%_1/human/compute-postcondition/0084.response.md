Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `s` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, `i` is 2, `d` is an integer equal to the input value, `b` is a string with at least 2 characters where the second character is '*', `j` is 0, and the current value of `b[j + 1]` is '*', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their initial values and properties. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, which means the program will exit the current loop or conditional block.
