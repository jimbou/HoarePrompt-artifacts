Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `s` is equal to the number of '@' characters in `b`, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, `i` is 2, `d` is an integer equal to the input value, `b` is a string, `j` is equal to the length of `b`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `a` remains an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `s` is equal to the total number of '@' characters in the string `b`, `stdin` still contains `t-5` test cases, `i` remains 2, `d` is still equal to the input value, `b` is the same string, and `j` is equal to the length of the string `b`.
