The code `s = s + 1` increments the value of `s` by 1. Since `s` is initially 0 or 1, its new value will be 1 or 2, respectively. The other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `s` is 1 or 2, `stdin` contains t-4 test cases, `i` is 1, `d` is an integer, `b` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `j` is 1**
