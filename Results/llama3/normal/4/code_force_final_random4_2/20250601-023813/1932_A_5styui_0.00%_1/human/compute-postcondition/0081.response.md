Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `s` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, `i` is 2, `d` is an integer equal to the input value, `b` is a string that must have at least 1 character and the first character of `b` is not '@', `j` is 0. The current value of `j` is 0 and the character at index `j` of string `b` is '*', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. The string `b` is not empty and the character at index `j` of string `b` is '*'. All other conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
