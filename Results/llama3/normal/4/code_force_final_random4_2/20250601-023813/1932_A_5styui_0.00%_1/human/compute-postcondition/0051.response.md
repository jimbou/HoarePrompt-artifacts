Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `s` is 0, `stdin` contains t-4 test cases, `i` is 1, `d` is an integer, `b` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `j` is 0. If the first character of `b` is '*', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `b` is not empty. If `b` is empty, the program checks the next character in `b`. If the next character is '*', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
