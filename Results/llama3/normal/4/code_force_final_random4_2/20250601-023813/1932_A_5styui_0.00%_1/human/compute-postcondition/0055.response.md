Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `s` is 0 or 1, `stdin` contains t-5 test cases, `i` is 1, `d` is an integer, `b` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `j` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `a`, `s`, `i`, `d`, `b`, and `j` remain unchanged. The `stdin` now contains t-5 test cases, as one test case has been processed. The `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or if statement it is directly inside, but does not affect the values of the variables.
