Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `s` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `i` is 0, `d` is an integer, `b` is a string with at least 2 characters, `j` is 0. If the character at index `j + 1` of `b` is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
