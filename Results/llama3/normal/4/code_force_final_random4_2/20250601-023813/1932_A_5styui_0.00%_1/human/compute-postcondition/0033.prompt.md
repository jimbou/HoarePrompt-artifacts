Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, s is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, i is 0, d is an integer, b is a string
Code of the loop:
for j in range(len(b)):
    if b[j] == '@':
        s = s + 1
    elif b[j] == '*':
        if b[:]:
            break
        elif b[j + 1] == '*':
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `s` is 0 or 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `i` is 0, `d` is an integer, `b` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `j` is 0. If the character at index `j` of string `b` is '@', then `s` is 1. If the character at index `j` of string `b` is '*', then if the string `b` is not empty, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the string `b` is empty, then if the character at index `j + 1` of `b` is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes occur.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `s` is 0, 1 or 2, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `i` is 0, `d` is an integer, `b` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `j` is 1. If the character at index `j` in string `b` is '@', `s` is set to 1 or 2. If the character at index `j` in string `b` is '*', if the string `b` is not empty, we are no longer inside the innermost loop or conditional statement. If the string `b` is empty, if the character at index `j + 1` in string `b` is '*', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes occur. If the character at index `j` in string `b` is neither '@' nor '*', no changes occur.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `s` is 0, 1, 2 or 3, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `i` is 0, `d` is an integer, `b` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `j` is 2. If the character at index `j` in string `b` is '@', then `s` is 1, 2 or 3. If the character at index `j` in string `b` is '*', then if string `b` is not empty or the character at index `j+1` in string `b` is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
