Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `s` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `i` is 0, `d` is an integer, `b` is a string with at least 2 characters where the character at index `j + 1` is '*', `j` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables `a`, `s`, `stdin`, `i`, `d`, `b`, and `j` remain the same as in the initial state. However, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.
