Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `s` is 0 or 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `i` is 0, `d` is an integer, `b` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `j` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state because the `break` statement only exits the innermost loop or if statement and does not change any variable values.
