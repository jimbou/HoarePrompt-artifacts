The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `d`. Since `d` was already an integer, its type remains the same, but its value is updated to the input value. The second line assigns the string value of the input to `b`. Since `b` was already a string, its type remains the same, but its value is updated to the input string.

Output State: **a is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, s is 0, stdin contains t-5 test cases, i is 2, d is an integer equal to the input value, b is a string equal to the input string, j is equal to the length of the new string b**
