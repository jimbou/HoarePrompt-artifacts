Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `s` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether the first character of `b` is '@' or not, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, `i` is 2, `d` is an integer equal to the input value, `b` is a string that must have at least 4 characters, `j` is 3 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `a`, `s`, `i`, `d`, `b`, and `j` do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. The stdin still contains `t-5` test cases.
