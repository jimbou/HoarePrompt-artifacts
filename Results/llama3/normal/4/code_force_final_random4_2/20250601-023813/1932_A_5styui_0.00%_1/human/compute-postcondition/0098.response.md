Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `s` is either 2 or 3 depending on whether the first character of `b` is '@' or not, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, `i` is 2, `d` is an integer equal to the input value, `b` is a string that must have at least 4 characters, `j` is 3**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been incremented by 1, so it is now either 2 or 3 depending on whether the first character of `b` is '@' or not. The values of the other variables remain the same.
