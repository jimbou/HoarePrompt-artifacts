Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `s` is 0, `stdin` contains t-4 test cases, `i` is 1, `d` is an integer, `b` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `j` is 0, and the first character of `b` is '*', and the current value of `b[j]` is '*', and `b` is an empty string. The current value of `b[j + 1]` is '*' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. The string `b` is still an empty string, but it must have at least 1 character. The first character of `b` is still '*', and the current value of `b[j]` is still '*'. The current value of `b[j + 1]` is still '*'. The other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
