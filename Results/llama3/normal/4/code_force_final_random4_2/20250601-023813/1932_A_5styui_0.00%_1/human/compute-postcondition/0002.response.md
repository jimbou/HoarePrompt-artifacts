Output State: **a is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, s is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, i is 0, d is an integer, b is a string**

In this final state, the value of `a` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `s` also remains 0 as it is not affected by the code. The number of test cases in stdin decreases by 1, from t-1 to t-2, as one test case is read by the `input()` function. The value of `i` remains 0 as it is not modified by the code. The variable `d` is assigned an integer value from the input, and the variable `b` is assigned a string value from the input.
