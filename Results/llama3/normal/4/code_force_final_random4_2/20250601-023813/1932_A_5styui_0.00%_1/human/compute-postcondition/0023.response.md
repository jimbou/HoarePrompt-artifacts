Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `s` is 0 or 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `i` is 0, `d` is an integer, `b` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `j` is 1. If the character at index `j` in string `b` is '*', if the string `b` is not empty, we are no longer inside the innermost loop or conditional statement. If the string `b` is empty, if the character at index `j + 1` in string `b` is '*', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes occur. If the character at index `j` in string `b` is not '*', no changes occur.***
