The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and b, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `b`. If `j` is less than `len(b)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, `b` has at least 3 characters. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `b` must have at least 4 characters.
State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `s` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether the first character of `b` is '@' or not, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, `i` is 2, `d` is an integer equal to the input value, `b` is a string that must have at least 4 characters, `j` is 3**
