Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `s` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether the first character of `b` is '@' or not, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, `i` is 2, `d` is an integer equal to the input value, `b` is a string that must have at least 4 characters, `j` is 3 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all the variables maintain their initial values as the `break` statement does not affect any variable values. However, it does cause the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional statement it is currently inside.
