Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, s is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of n characters, where each character is either '.', '@', or '*'.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(a):
    d = int(input())
    b = input()
    for j in range(len(b)):
        if b[j] == '@':
            s = s + 1
        elif b[j] == '*':
            if b[:]:
                break
            elif b[j + 1] == '*':
                break
    print(s)
    s = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `s` is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, `i` is 0, `d` is an integer, `b` is a string, `j` is equal to the length of string `b`. If the string `b` contains '@', then `s` is equal to the number of '@' in string `b`. If the string `b` contains '*', then if the string `b` is not empty, we are no longer inside the innermost loop or conditional statement. If the string `b` is empty, if the character at index `j + 1` in string `b` is '*', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes occur, and the value of `s` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `s` is 0, `stdin` contains t-4 test cases, `i` is 1, `d` is an integer, `b` is a string, `j` is equal to the length of string `b`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `s` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, `i` is 2, `d` is an integer equal to the input value, `b` is a string, `j` is equal to the length of `b`, and the number of '@' characters in `b` which is `s` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
