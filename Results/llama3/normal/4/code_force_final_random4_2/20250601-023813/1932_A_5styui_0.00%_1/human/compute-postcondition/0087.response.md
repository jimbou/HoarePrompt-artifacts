Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `s` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, `i` is 2, `d` is an integer equal to the input value, `b` is a string that must have at least 1 character and the first character of `b` is not '@', `j` is 0. If the first character of the string `b` is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
