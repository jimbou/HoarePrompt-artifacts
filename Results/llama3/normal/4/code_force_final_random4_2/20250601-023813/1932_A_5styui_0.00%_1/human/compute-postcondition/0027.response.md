Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `s` is 0, 1 or 2, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `i` is 0, `d` is an integer, `b` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `j` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the additional information that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `a`, `s`, `stdin`, `i`, `d`, `b`, and `j` remain unchanged.
