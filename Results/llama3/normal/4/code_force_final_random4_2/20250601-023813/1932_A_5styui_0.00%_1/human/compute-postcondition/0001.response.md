To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and `a`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `a`. If `a` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

Since `a` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, we can conclude that `a` is at least 1. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `i` to be 0, which is the initial value of the loop variable.

State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `s` is 0, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `i` is 0**
