Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `s` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `i` is 0, `d` is an integer, `b` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `j` is 0, the character at index `j` of string `b` is not '@', and the current value of the character at index `j` of string `b` is '*', and the string `b` is not empty, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `a`, `s`, `i`, `d`, `b`, and `j` remain unchanged, and the character at index `j` of string `b` is still '*', and the string `b` is still not empty. The stdin still contains `t-2` test cases.
