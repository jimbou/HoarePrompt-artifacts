Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to collect the maximum number of coins. It simply counts the number of '@' characters in the string, without considering the movement constraints. 

For example, if the input is ".@@*@.**@@", the program will output 5, but the correct output should be 3, because we can't move to the cell with '*' and we can't move to the cell that is two steps away if there is a '*' in between.

The program does not handle the case where there are '*' characters in between the '@' characters, and it does not consider the movement constraints. Therefore, it does not correctly solve the problem.
