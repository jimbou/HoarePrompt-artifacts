Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `s` is 0, 1 or 2, `stdin` contains t-4 or t-5 test cases, `i` is 1, `d` is an integer, `b` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, `j` is 2. If the character at index `j` in string `b` is '*', then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
