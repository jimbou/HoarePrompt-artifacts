Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `s` is 1 if the first character of `b` is '@', otherwise `s` is 0. `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, `i` is 2, `d` is an integer equal to the input value, `b` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, `j` is either 3 or undefined, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `a`, `s`, `stdin`, `i`, `d`, and `b` remain unchanged. The value of `j` is either 3 or undefined, depending on whether the first character of `b` is '*' or not. The most notable change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, which affects the control flow of the program.
