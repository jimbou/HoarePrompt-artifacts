Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `s` is 0, `stdin` contains t-4 test cases, `i` is 1, `d` is an integer, `b` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `j` is 0, and the first character of `b` is '*', and the current value of `b[j]` is '*', and `b` is not empty, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `a`, `s`, `stdin`, `i`, `d`, `b`, and `j` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, which means the program will exit the current loop or conditional statement and continue executing the code outside of it.
