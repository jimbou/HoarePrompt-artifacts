Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `s` is 0, 1, 2 or 3, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `i` is 0, `d` is an integer, `b` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `j` is 2. If the character at index `j` in string `b` is '@', then `s` is 1, 2 or 3. If the character at index `j` in string `b` is '*', then if string `b` is not empty or the character at index `j+1` in string `b` is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
