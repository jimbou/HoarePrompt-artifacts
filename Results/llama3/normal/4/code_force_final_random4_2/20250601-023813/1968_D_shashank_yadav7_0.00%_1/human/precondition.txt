The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, the first line contains four integers n, k, P_B, P_S where n is the length of the permutation, k is the duration of the game, P_B is Bodya's starting position, and P_S is Sasha's starting position. The second line contains a permutation p of length n, and the third line contains an array a of length n. All integers are non-negative and within the specified ranges.
