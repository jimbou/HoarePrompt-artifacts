Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is 0, `b` is an integer minus one, `s` is an integer minus one, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `sp` is the integer at index `s` in list `a`, `bp` is the integer at index `b` in list `a`, `bm` is the product of the integer at index `b` in list `a` and (k+1) which is equal to `bp`, `sm` is the product of the integer at index `s` in list `a` and (k+1) which is equal to `sp`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged.
