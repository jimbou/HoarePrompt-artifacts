Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is an integer minus one, `s` is an integer minus one, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `sp` is the integer at index `s` in list `a` plus `a[s]`, `bp` is the integer at index `b` in list `a` plus `a[b]`, `bm` is the maximum of its original value and `a[b] * (k-1) + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of its original value and `a[s] * (k-1) + sp`, `k` is an integer minus two and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside.
