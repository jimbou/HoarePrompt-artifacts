Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 3, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `b` is the integer at index `b` in list `p` minus one, `s` is the integer at index `s` in list `p` minus one, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `sp` is the integer at index `s` in list `a` plus `a[s]` plus `a[s]`, `bp` is the integer at index `b` in list `a` plus `a[b]` plus `a[b]`, `bm` is the maximum of its original value and `a[b]` * (`k-2`) + `bp` plus `a[b]` * (`k-1`), `sm` is the maximum of its original value and `a[s]` * (`k-2`) + `sp` plus `a[s]` * (`k-1`), `k` is an integer minus three, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code `break` does not change the values of any variables, but it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of the fact that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
