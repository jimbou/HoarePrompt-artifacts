Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is an integer minus one, `s` is an integer minus one, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `sp` is the integer at index `s` in list `a` plus `a[s]`, `bp` is the integer at index `b` in list `a` plus `a[b]`, `bm` is the maximum of its original value and `a[b] * (k-1) + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of its original value and `a[s] * (k-1) + sp`, `k` is an integer minus two**

In natural language, the output state is: All variables remain the same as in the initial state, except for `k`, which is decremented by 1, and `bm` and `sm`, which are updated to be the maximum of their original values and the new values calculated using the decremented `k`.
