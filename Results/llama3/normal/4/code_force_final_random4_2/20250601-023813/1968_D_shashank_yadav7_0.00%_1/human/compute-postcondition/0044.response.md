Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 2, n is greater than 1, b is the integer at index b in list p minus one, s is the integer at index s in list p minus one, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, sp is the integer at index s in list a plus a[s] plus a[s], bp is the integer at index b in list a plus a[b] plus a[b], bm is a[b] * (-1) plus the maximum of bm and a[b] * (k-1) plus bp plus max(bm, a[b] * k + bp), sm is a[s] * (-1) plus the maximum of sm and a[s] * (k-1) plus sp plus max(sm, a[s] * k + sp), k is one less than its original value.**

In this final state, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `p`, and `a` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The values of `b` and `s` are updated to be the integer at index `b` and `s` in list `p` minus one, respectively. The values of `sp` and `bp` are incremented by `a[s]` and `a[b]`, respectively. The values of `bm` and `sm` are updated to be the maximum of their previous values and the sum of `a[b] * k` and `bp`, and `a[s] * k` and `sp`, respectively. The value of `k` is decremented by one.
