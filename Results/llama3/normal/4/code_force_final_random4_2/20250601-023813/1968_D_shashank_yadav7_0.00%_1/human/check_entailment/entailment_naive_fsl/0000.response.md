Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when the game lasts for more than n turns, where n is the length of the permutation. In this case, the players will start to repeat their moves, and the program does not account for this. 

For example, if the input is:

10
8 10 4 1
5 1 4 3 2 8 6 7
1 1 2 1 2 100 101 102

The program will not correctly calculate the scores of Bodya and Sasha.

To fix this, the program needs to keep track of the cycles in the permutation and calculate the scores accordingly. 

Here is a possible correction:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        sp = a[s]
        bp = a[b]
        bm = a[b] * k
        sm = a[s] * k
        cycle_b = []
        cycle_s = []
        for i in range(n):
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
            if b not in cycle_b:
                cycle_b.append(b)
            if s not in cycle_s:
                cycle_s.append(s)
            if b in cycle_b and s in cycle_s:
                break
        cycle_b = cycle_b[cycle_b.index(b):]
        cycle_s = cycle_s[cycle_s.index(s):]
        cb_len = len(cycle_b)
        cs_len = len(cycle_s)
        for i in range(k):
            bm += a[b]
            sm += a[s]
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
            if i >= n:
                b = cycle_b[i % cb_len]
                s = cycle_s[i % cs_len]
        if bm > sm:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bm < sm:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')
```
