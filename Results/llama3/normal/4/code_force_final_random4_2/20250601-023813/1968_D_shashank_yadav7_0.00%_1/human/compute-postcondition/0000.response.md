The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that the standard input contains an integer `t` followed by `t` sets of inputs, the first integer is read and assigned to `t`.

The value of `t` is now an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), as specified in the initial state.

The remaining input in the standard input is still present, containing `t` sets of inputs, each set consisting of four integers `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, followed by two lists of `n` integers `p_1,...,p_n` and `a_1,...,a_n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` sets of inputs, each set consisting of four integers `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, followed by two lists of `n` integers `p_1,...,p_n` and `a_1,...,a_n`.**
