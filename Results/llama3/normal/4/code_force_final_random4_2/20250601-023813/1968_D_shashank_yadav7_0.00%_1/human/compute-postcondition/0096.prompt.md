You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t, followed by t sets of inputs. Each set of inputs contains four integers n, k, P_B, P_S, followed by two lists of n integers p_1,...,p_n and a_1,...,a_n. 1 <= t <= 10^4, 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= k <= 10^9, 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n, 1 <= p_i, a_i <= n.
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k, b, s = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        b -= 1

        sp = a[s]
        
        bp = a[b]
        
        bm = a[b] * k
        
        sm = a[s] * k
        
        for i in range(n):
            k -= 1
            if k == 0:
                break
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
            bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
            sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
            sp += a[s]
            bp += a[b]
        
        if bm > sm:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bm < sm:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')
        
    #State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is equal to t, n is an integer, b is the integer at index b in list p minus t, s is the integer at index s in list p minus t, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, sp is the integer at index s in list a plus t times a[s], bp is the integer at index b in list a plus t times a[b], bm is the maximum of its original value and the sum of a[b] * k + bp for all k from t-1 to 1, sm is the maximum of its original value and the sum of a[s] * k + sp for all k from t-1 to 1, k is 0. If bm is greater than sm, 'Bodya' is printed. If bm is less than sm, 'Sasha' is printed. Otherwise, 'Draw' is printed.

```

Return Postconditions: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is equal to t, n is an integer, b is the integer at index b in list p minus t, s is the integer at index s in list p minus t, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, sp is the integer at index s in list a plus t times a[s], bp is the integer at index b in list a plus t times a[b], bm is the maximum of its original value and the sum of a[b] * k + bp for all k from t-1 to 1, sm is the maximum of its original value and the sum of a[s] * k + sp for all k from t-1 to 1, k is 0. If bm is greater than sm, 'Bodya' is printed. If bm is less than sm, 'Sasha' is printed. Otherwise, 'Draw' is printed.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
