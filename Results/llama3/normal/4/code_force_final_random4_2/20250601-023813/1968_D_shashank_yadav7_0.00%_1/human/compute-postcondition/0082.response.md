Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is greater than or equal to 0, i is n+2, k is 0, b is the integer at index b in list p minus n+1, s is the integer at index s in list p minus n+1, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, sp is the integer at index s in list a plus n times a[s], bp is the integer at index b in list a plus n times a[b], bm is the maximum of its original value and the sum of a[b] * k + bp for all k from n-1 to 1, sm is the maximum of its original value and the sum of a[s] * k + sp for all k from n-1 to 1.**

This output state represents the final state of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations. The loop iterates n times, and in each iteration, it updates the values of b, s, sp, bp, bm, and sm based on the current values of k, a, and p. The loop terminates when k becomes 0. The final state of the variables reflects the cumulative effect of these updates over all iterations.
