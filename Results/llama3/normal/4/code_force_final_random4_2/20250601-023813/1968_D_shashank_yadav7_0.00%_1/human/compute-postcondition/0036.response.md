Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `b` is the integer at index `b` in list `p` minus one, `s` is the integer at index `s` in list `p` minus one, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `sp` is the integer at index `s` in list `a`, `bp` is the integer at index `b` in list `a`, `bm` is `a[b] * (k-1)`, `sm` is `a[s] * (k-1)`, `k` is an integer minus `n` and equals 0, which means `n` equals the negative of an integer, `bm` is `a[b] * (-1)`, `sm` is `a[s] * (-1)`.**
