Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, b is an integer minus one, s is an integer minus one, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, sp is the integer at index s in list a, bp is the integer at index b in list a, bm is the product of the integer at index b in list a and k, sm is the product of the integer at index s in list a and k, stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    k -= 1
    if k == 0:
        break
    b = p[b] - 1
    s = p[s] - 1
    bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
    sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
    sp += a[s]
    bp += a[b]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 1, n is an integer greater than 0, b is an integer minus one, s is an integer minus one, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, sp is the integer at index s in list a plus a[s], bp is the integer at index b in list a plus a[b], bm is the maximum of its original value and a[b] * k + bp, sm is the maximum of its original value and a[s] * k + sp, k is an integer minus one.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 2, n is an integer greater than 1, b is the integer at index b in list p minus one, s is the integer at index s in list p minus one, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, sp is the integer at index s in list a plus a[s] plus a[s], bp is the integer at index b in list a plus a[b] plus a[b], bm is the maximum of its original value and a[b] * (k-1) + bp plus a[b] * k, sm is the maximum of its original value and a[s] * (k-1) + sp plus a[s] * k, k is an integer minus two. If k is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 3, n is an integer greater than 3, b is the integer at index b in list p minus one, s is the integer at index s in list p minus one, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, sp is the integer at index s in list a plus a[s] plus a[s] plus a[s], bp is the integer at index b in list a plus a[b] plus a[b] plus a[b], bm is the maximum of its original value and a[b] * (k-2) + bp plus a[b] * (k-1) plus a[b] * k + bp, sm is the maximum of its original value and a[s] * (k-2) + sp plus a[s] * (k-1) plus a[s] * k + sp, k is an integer minus three. If k equals 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
