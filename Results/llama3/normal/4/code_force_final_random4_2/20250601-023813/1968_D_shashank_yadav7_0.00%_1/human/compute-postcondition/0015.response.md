Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 3, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `b` is the integer at index `b` in list `p` minus one, `s` is the integer at index `s` in list `p` minus one, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `sp` is the integer at index `s` in list `a` plus `a[s]` plus `a[s]`, `bp` is the integer at index `b` in list `a` plus `a[b]` plus `a[b]`, `bm` is the maximum of its original value and `a[b]` * (`k-2`) + `bp` plus `a[b]` * (`k-1`), `sm` is the maximum of its original value and `a[s]` * (`k-2`) + `sp` plus `a[s]` * (`k-1`), `k` is an integer minus three**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` is still an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is still 3, `n` is still an integer greater than 3, `b` and `s` are still the integers at their respective indices in list `p` minus one, `p` and `a` are still lists of integers, `sp` and `bp` are still the sums of the integer at their respective indices in list `a` plus the value at that index plus the value at that index, `bm` and `sm` are still the maximum of their original values and the updated expressions involving `k-1`, and `k` is now an integer minus three.
