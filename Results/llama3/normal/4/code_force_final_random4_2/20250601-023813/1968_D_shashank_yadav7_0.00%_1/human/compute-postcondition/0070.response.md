Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is greater than 0, i is n+2, k is n-2, b is the integer at index b in list p minus two, s is the integer at index s in list p minus two, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, sp is the integer at index s in list a plus a[s], bp is the integer at index b in list a plus a[b], bm is the maximum of its original value and a[b] * (n-2) + a[b] * (n-2) + a[b], sm is the maximum of its original value and a[s] * (n-2) + a[s] * (n-2) + a[s].**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `t` remains unchanged, still an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The value of `n` also remains unchanged, still greater than 0. The value of `i` is still `n+2`. The value of `k` is still `n-2`. The value of `b` is now the integer at index `b` in list `p` minus two, because it was decremented by one in the first line of code. Similarly, the value of `s` is now the integer at index `s` in list `p` minus two. The list `p` and `a` remain unchanged. The value of `sp` is now the integer at index `s` in list `a` plus `a[s]`, because it was incremented by `a[s]` in the fourth line of code. Similarly, the value of `bp` is now the integer at index `b` in list `a` plus `a[b]`. The value of `bm` is now the maximum of its original value and `a[b] * (n-2) + a[b] * (n-2) + a[b]`, because it was updated in the second line of code. Similarly, the value of `sm` is now the maximum of its original value and `a[s] * (n-2) + a[s] * (n-2) + a[s]`.
