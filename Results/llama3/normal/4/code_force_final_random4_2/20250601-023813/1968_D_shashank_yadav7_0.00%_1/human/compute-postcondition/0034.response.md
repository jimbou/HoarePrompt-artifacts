According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is `n+1`, which means `n` must be at least 0 for `i` to be 1. So, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0 and `i` is now 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `b` is the integer at index `b` in list `p` minus one, `s` is the integer at index `s` in list `p` minus one, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `sp` is the integer at index `s` in list `a`, `bp` is the integer at index `b` in list `a`, `bm` is `a[b] * k`, `sm` is `a[s] * k`, `k` is an integer minus `n-1`, stdin contains no input**
