Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n+3`, `k` is `n-2`, `b` is the integer at index `b` in list `p` minus two, `s` is the integer at index `s` in list `p` minus two, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `sp` is the integer at index `s` in list `a` plus `a[s]`, `bp` is the integer at index `b` in list `a` plus `a[b]`, `bm` is the maximum of its original value and `a[b] * (n-1) + a[b] * (n-1) + a[b]`, `sm` is the maximum of its original value and `a[s] * (n-1) + a[s] * (n-1) + a[s]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with all variables retaining their original values and properties. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, but this does not affect the values of the variables.
