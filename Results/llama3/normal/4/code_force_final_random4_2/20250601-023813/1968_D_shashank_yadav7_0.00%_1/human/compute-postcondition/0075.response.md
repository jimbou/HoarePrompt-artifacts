Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is greater than 1, i is n+3, b is the integer at index b-1 in list p minus two, s is the integer at index s-1 in list p minus two, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, sp is the integer at index s in list a plus a[s] plus a[s], bp is the integer at index b in list a plus a[b] plus a[b], bm is the maximum of its original value and a[b] * (n-1) + a[b] * (n-1) + a[b] plus max(bm, a[b] * k + bp), sm is the maximum of its original value and a[s] * (n-1) + a[s] * (n-1) + a[s] plus max(sm, a[s] * k + sp).**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `i`, `p`, and `a` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The values of `b` and `s` are updated to be the integer at index `b-1` and `s-1` in list `p` minus two, respectively. The values of `sp` and `bp` are incremented by `a[s]` and `a[b]`, respectively. The values of `bm` and `sm` are updated to be the maximum of their original values and the new calculated values based on `a[b]`, `a[s]`, `k`, `bp`, and `sp`.
