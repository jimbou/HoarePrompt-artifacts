Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 1, n is an integer greater than 0, b is an integer minus one, s is an integer minus one, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, sp is the integer at index s in list a, bp is the integer at index b in list a. If k is 0, then bm is equal to bp and sm is equal to sp, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, k is an integer minus one.***
