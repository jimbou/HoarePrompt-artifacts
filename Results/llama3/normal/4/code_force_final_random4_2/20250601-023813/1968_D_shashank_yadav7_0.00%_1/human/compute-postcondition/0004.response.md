Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 1, n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer minus one, b is an integer minus one, s is an integer minus one, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, sp is the integer at index s in list a, bp is the integer at index b in list a, bm is the product of the integer at index b in list a and (k+1), sm is the product of the integer at index s in list a and (k+1), stdin is empty**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of k is decreased by 1. The values of the other variables remain the same. The product of the integer at index b in list a and k, and the product of the integer at index s in list a and k are not changed, but they are now equal to the product of the integer at index b in list a and (k+1), and the product of the integer at index s in list a and (k+1) respectively.
