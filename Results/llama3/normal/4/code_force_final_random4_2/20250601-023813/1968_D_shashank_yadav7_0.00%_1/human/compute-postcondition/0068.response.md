Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n+2`, `k` is `n-2` and the current value of `k` is 0, `b` is the integer at index `b` in list `p` minus one, `s` is the integer at index `s` in list `p` minus one, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `sp` is the integer at index `s` in list `a`, `bp` is the integer at index `b` in list `a`, `bm` is `a[b] * (n-2)` and the current value of `bm` is 0, `sm` is `a[s] * (n-2)` and the current value of `sm` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside.
