Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 2, n is greater than 1, b is the integer at index b in list p minus one, s is the integer at index s in list p minus one, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, sp is the integer at index s in list a plus a[s], bp is the integer at index b in list a plus a[b], bm is a[b] * (-1) plus the maximum of bm and a[b] * (k-1) plus bp, sm is a[s] * (-1) plus the maximum of sm and a[s] * (k-1) plus sp, k is one less than its original value.**

In this output state, the value of k has been decremented by 1, and the values of bm and sm have been updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged.
