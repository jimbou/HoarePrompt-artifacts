Functionality: **This function simulates a game between two players, Bodya and Sasha, based on input parameters. It accepts a number of test cases (t), and for each test case, it reads in the number of rounds (n), a constant (k), and the initial positions of Bodya (P_B) and Sasha (P_S) on a circular track. It also reads in two lists of integers representing the track's layout (p) and the points awarded at each position (a). The function then simulates the game, moving Bodya and Sasha around the track according to the layout and updating their scores based on the points awarded at each position. After the simulation, it prints out the winner of the game ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' if the scores are tied).**
