Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n+4`, `b` is the integer at index `b-1` in list `p` minus two, `s` is the integer at index `s-1` in list `p` minus two, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `sp` is the integer at index `s` in list `a` plus `a[s]` plus `a[s]`, `bp` is the integer at index `b` in list `a` plus `a[b]` plus `a[b]`, `bm` is the maximum of its original value and `a[b] * (n-1) + a[b] * (n-1) + a[b]` plus `max(bm, a[b] * (k-1) + bp)`, `sm` is the maximum of its original value and `a[s] * (n-1) + a[s] * (n-1) + a[s]` plus `max(sm, a[s] * (k-1) + sp)`, `k` is one less than its original value, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `i`, `b`, `s`, `p`, `a`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, `sm`, and `k` remain unchanged, but we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
