Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is n, n is an integer, b is the integer at index b in list p minus one, s is the integer at index s in list p minus one, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, sp is the integer at index s in list a plus a[s] plus a[s] plus a[s] plus ... plus a[s] (n times), bp is the integer at index b in list a plus a[b] plus a[b] plus a[b] plus ... plus a[b] (n times), bm is the maximum of its original value and a[b] * (k-(n-1)) + bp plus a[b] * (k-(n-2)) plus a[b] * (k-(n-3)) plus ... plus a[b] * k + bp, sm is the maximum of its original value and a[s] * (k-(n-1)) + sp plus a[s] * (k-(n-2)) plus a[s] * (k-(n-3)) plus ... plus a[s] * k + sp, k is an integer minus n.**

This output state describes the final state of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations. The loop counter `i` has reached the value of `n`, which is the number of iterations. The variables `b` and `s` have been updated to point to the indices in the list `p` minus one. The variables `sp` and `bp` have been updated to include the sum of the elements at the indices `s` and `b` in the list `a`, respectively, repeated `n` times. The variables `bm` and `sm` have been updated to include the maximum of their original values and the sum of the products of the elements at the indices `b` and `s` in the list `a`, respectively, with the value of `k` minus the current iteration number, repeated `n` times. Finally, the variable `k` has been decremented by `n`.
