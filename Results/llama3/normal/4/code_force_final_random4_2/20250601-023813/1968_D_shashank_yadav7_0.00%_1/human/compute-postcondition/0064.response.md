Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is n+2, n is an integer, b is the integer at index b in list p minus one, s is the integer at index s in list p minus one, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, sp is the integer at index s in list a, bp is the integer at index b in list a, bm is a[b] * k, sm is a[s] * k, k is n-1 less than its original value, stdin contains 0 inputs.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `b`, `s`, `p`, `a`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, `sm`, and `k` are updated according to the code snippet. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The values of `n`, `b`, `s`, `p`, and `a` are updated based on the input values. The values of `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, and `sm` are calculated based on the updated values of `b`, `s`, `a`, and `k`. The value of `k` is updated to be `n-1` less than its original value. The stdin is empty as all inputs have been consumed by the code.
