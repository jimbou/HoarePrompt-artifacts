Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `b` is the integer at index `b` in list `p` minus one, `s` is the integer at index `s` in list `p` minus one, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `sp` is the integer at index `s` in list `a`, `bp` is the integer at index `b` in list `a`. If `k` equals 0, then `n` equals the negative of an integer, `bm` is `a[b] * (-1)`, `sm` is `a[s] * (-1)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute.***
