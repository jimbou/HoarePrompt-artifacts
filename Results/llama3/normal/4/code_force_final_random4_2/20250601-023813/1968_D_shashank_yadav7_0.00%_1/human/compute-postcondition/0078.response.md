Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is greater than 1, i is n+4, b is the integer at index b-1 in list p minus two, s is the integer at index s-1 in list p minus two, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, sp is the integer at index s in list a plus a[s] plus a[s], bp is the integer at index b in list a plus a[b] plus a[b], bm is the maximum of its original value and a[b] * (n-1) + a[b] * (n-1) + a[b] plus max(bm, a[b] * (k-1) + bp), sm is the maximum of its original value and a[s] * (n-1) + a[s] * (n-1) + a[s] plus max(sm, a[s] * (k-1) + sp), k is one less than its original value.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their original properties, except for k, which has been decremented by 1. The values of bm and sm have been updated to reflect the new value of k.
