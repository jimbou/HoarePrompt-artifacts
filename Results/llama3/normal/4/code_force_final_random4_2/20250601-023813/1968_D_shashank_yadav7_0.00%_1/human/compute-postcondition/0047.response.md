Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `b` is the integer at index `b` in list `p` minus one, `s` is the integer at index `s` in list `p` minus one, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `sp` is the integer at index `s` in list `a` plus `a[s]` plus `a[s]`, `bp` is the integer at index `b` in list `a` plus `a[b]` plus `a[b]`, `bm` is `a[b]` * (-1) plus the maximum of `bm` and `a[b]` * (k-2) plus `bp` plus max(`bm`, `a[b]` * (k-1) + `bp`), `sm` is `a[s]` * (-1) plus the maximum of `sm` and `a[s]` * (k-2) plus `sp` plus max(`sm`, `a[s]` * (k-1) + `sp`), `k` is two less than its original value, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain the same, and the only change is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
