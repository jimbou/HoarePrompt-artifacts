Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is `n+2`, `n` must be greater than 0, `b` is the integer at index `b` in list `p` minus one, `s` is the integer at index `s` in list `p` minus one, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `sp` is the integer at index `s` in list `a`, `bp` is the integer at index `b` in list `a`, `bm` is `a[b] * (n-2)`, `sm` is `a[s] * (n-2)`, `k` is `n-2`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been decremented by 1, which affects the values of `bm` and `sm`. The new value of `k` is `n-2`, and the values of `bm` and `sm` are updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged.
