Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is greater than or equal to 0, i is n+2, k is 0, b is the integer at index b in list p minus n+1, s is the integer at index s in list p minus n+1, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, sp is the integer at index s in list a plus n times a[s], bp is the integer at index b in list a plus n times a[b], bm is the maximum of its original value and the sum of a[b] * k + bp for all k from n-1 to 1, sm is the maximum of its original value and the sum of a[s] * k + sp for all k from n-1 to 1. If bm is less than sm, 'Sasha' is printed. Otherwise, 'Draw' is printed.***
