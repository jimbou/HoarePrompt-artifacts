Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n+2`, `k` is `n-2`, `b` is the integer at index `b` in list `p` minus one, `s` is the integer at index `s` in list `p` minus one, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `sp` is the integer at index `s` in list `a`, `bp` is the integer at index `b` in list `a`, `bm` is `a[b] * (n-2)`, `sm` is `a[s] * (n-2)`. If `k` is 0, then `bm` and `sm` are 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
