Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n+3`, `k` is `n-2`, `b` is the integer at index `b` in list `p` minus two, `s` is the integer at index `s` in list `p` minus two, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `sp` is the integer at index `s` in list `a` plus `a[s]`, `bp` is the integer at index `b` in list `a` plus `a[b]`, `bm` is the maximum of its original value and `a[b] * (n-1) + a[b] * (n-1) + a[b]`, `sm` is the maximum of its original value and `a[s] * (n-1) + a[s] * (n-1) + a[s]`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `k` has been decremented by 1, so it is now `n-2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
