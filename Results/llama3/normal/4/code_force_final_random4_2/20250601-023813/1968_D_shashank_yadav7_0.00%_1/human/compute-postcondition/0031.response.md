Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is n, n is an integer, b is the integer at index b in list p minus one, s is the integer at index s in list p minus one, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, sp is the integer at index s in list a plus a[s] plus a[s] plus a[s] plus ... plus a[s] (n times), bp is the integer at index b in list a plus a[b] plus a[b] plus a[b] plus ... plus a[b] (n times), bm is the maximum of its original value and a[b] * (k-(n-1)) + bp plus a[b] * (k-(n-2)) plus a[b] * (k-(n-3)) plus ... plus a[b] * k + bp, sm is the maximum of its original value and a[s] * (k-(n-1)) + sp plus a[s] * (k-(n-2)) plus a[s] * (k-(n-3)) plus ... plus a[s] * k + sp, k is an integer minus n. If bm is greater than sm, 'Bodya' is printed. If bm is less than sm, 'Sasha' is printed. Otherwise, 'Draw' is printed.***
