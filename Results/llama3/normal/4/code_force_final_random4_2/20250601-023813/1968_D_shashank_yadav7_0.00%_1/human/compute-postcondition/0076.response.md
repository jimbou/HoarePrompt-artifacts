The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n+3`, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than `i`. So `i` is `n+4` and `n` is greater than `n+4`. Since `n` is greater than 1, `n` is greater than `n+4` is not possible. So `n` is greater than `n+4` is not possible. So `n` is greater than `n+4` is not possible.
