Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 2, n is an integer greater than 1, b is the integer at index b in list p minus one, s is the integer at index s in list p minus one, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, sp is the integer at index s in list a plus a[s] plus a[s], bp is the integer at index b in list a plus a[b] plus a[b], bm is the maximum of its original value and a[b] * (k-1) + bp plus a[b] * k, sm is the maximum of its original value and a[s] * (k-1) + sp plus a[s] * k, k is an integer minus two. If k is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.**

In this output state, the values of `b` and `s` have been updated to be the integer at index `b` and `s` in list `p` minus one, respectively. The values of `sp` and `bp` have been incremented by `a[s]` and `a[b]`, respectively. The values of `bm` and `sm` have been updated to be the maximum of their original values and `a[b] * k + bp` and `a[s] * k + sp`, respectively. The value of `k` remains unchanged. All other variables remain unchanged.
