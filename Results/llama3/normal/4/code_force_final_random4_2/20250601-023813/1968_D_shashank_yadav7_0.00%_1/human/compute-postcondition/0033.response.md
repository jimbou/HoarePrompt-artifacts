Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is n+1, n is an integer, b is the integer at index b in list p minus one, s is the integer at index s in list p minus one, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, sp is the integer at index s in list a, bp is the integer at index b in list a, bm is a[b] * k, sm is a[s] * k, k is an integer minus n-1, stdin contains no input.**

The code first reads four integers from stdin and assigns them to n, k, b, and s. Then it reads two lists of integers from stdin and assigns them to p and a. The values of b and s are decremented by 1. The values of sp, bp, bm, and sm are calculated based on the values of a, b, s, and k. The final state includes the updated values of these variables, as well as the unchanged values of t and i. Stdin is now empty after reading all the inputs.
