Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 3, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `b` is the integer at index `b` in list `p` minus one, `s` is the integer at index `s` in list `p` minus one, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `sp` is the integer at index `s` in list `a` plus `a[s]` plus `a[s]`, `bp` is the integer at index `b` in list `a` plus `a[b]` plus `a[b]`, `bm` is the maximum of its original value and `a[b]` * (`k-2`) + `bp` plus `a[b]` * (`k-1`), `sm` is the maximum of its original value and `a[s]` * (`k-2`) + `sp` plus `a[s]` * (`k-1`), `k` is an integer minus three. If `k` equals 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
