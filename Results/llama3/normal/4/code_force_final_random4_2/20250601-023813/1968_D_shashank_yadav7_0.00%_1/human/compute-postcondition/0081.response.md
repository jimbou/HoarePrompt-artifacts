Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is greater than 1, i is n+4, b is the integer at index b in list p minus one, s is the integer at index s in list p minus one, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, sp is the integer at index s in list a plus a[s] plus a[s] plus a[s], bp is the integer at index b in list a plus a[b] plus a[b] plus a[b], bm is the maximum of its original value and a[b] * (n-1) + a[b] * (n-1) + a[b] plus max(bm, a[b] * (k-1) + bp), sm is the maximum of its original value and a[s] * (n-1) + a[s] * (n-1) + a[s] plus max(sm, a[s] * (k-1) + sp), and k is one less than its original value.**

The code updates the values of `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, and `bp` based on the values of `p`, `a`, `n`, and `k`. The value of `t` remains unchanged. The value of `i` is not affected by the code. The list `p` and `a` remain unchanged. The value of `n` is not modified. The value of `k` is decremented by 1.
