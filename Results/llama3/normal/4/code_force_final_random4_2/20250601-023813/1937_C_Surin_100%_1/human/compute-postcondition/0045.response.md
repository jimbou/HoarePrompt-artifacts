Output: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is n-1 if the user input string `r` is '<' for all iterations, otherwise `v1` is the last value of `v2` for which the user input string `r` is '<', `kp` is 0, `v2` is n-1, `I` is a function that takes no arguments and returns a list of integers from stdin, `R` is a function that takes no arguments and returns an integer from stdin, stdin is empty, the string "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" has been printed for each iteration where `v2` is the current value of `i` and `v1` is the value of `v1` from the previous iteration, `r` is a string entered by the user for each iteration, and `prev` is 1 if the user input string `r` is '>', otherwise `prev` is 0 if the user input string `r` is '=', and the string "? [i] [i] [prev] [prev]" is printed where `i` is the current value of `i` and `prev` is the current value of `prev`, and `r2` is a string entered by the user for this iteration, and this is printed: "?
