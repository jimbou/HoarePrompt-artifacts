The code prints a formatted string containing the values of `i`, `i`, `prev`, and `prev`. 

Here's a breakdown of the values:

- `i` is 2.
- `prev` is either 1 or 0, depending on the user's input string `r`. If `r` is '>', then `prev` is 1. If `r` is '=', then `prev` is 0.

Since the exact value of `r` is not provided, we can't determine the exact value of `prev`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the string '? 2 2' followed by the value of `prev` twice.

Output: **? 2 2 [prev] [prev] (where prev is 1 if the user input string r is '>', otherwise prev is 0)**
