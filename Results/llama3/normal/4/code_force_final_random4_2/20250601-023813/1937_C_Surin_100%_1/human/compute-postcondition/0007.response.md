The first line flushes the output buffer, ensuring that the printed string "? 0 0 1 1" is displayed immediately. The second line assigns the input string to `r`. Since stdin is empty, the input function will wait for user input. Once the user enters a string, it will be assigned to `r`.

Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, i is 1, g is 0, v1 is 0, kp is 0, v2 is 1, I is a function that takes no arguments and returns a list of integers from stdin, R is a function that takes no arguments and returns an integer from stdin, stdin is empty, and the string "? 0 0 1 1" has been printed, r is a string entered by the user**
