Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1` if the user input string `r` is '<' for all iterations, otherwise `v1` is the last value of `v2` for which the user input string `r` is '<', `kp` is 0, `v2` is `n-1`, `I` is a function that takes no arguments and returns a list of integers from stdin, `R` is a function that takes no arguments and returns an integer from stdin, stdin contains 0 inputs if the user input string `r` is '>', otherwise stdin is empty, `r` is the user input string, and `prev` is 3 if the user input string `r` is '<' or '>', otherwise `prev` is 0 if the user input string `r` is '='**

In this output state, the value of `prev` has been updated to 3, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The state of `prev` is now dependent on the value of `r`, which is the user input string. If `r` is '<' or '>', `prev` is 3, otherwise it is 0 if `r` is '='.
