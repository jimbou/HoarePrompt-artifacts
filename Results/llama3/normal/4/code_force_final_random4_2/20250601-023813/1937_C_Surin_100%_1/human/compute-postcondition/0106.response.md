Output: **n is an integer that must be at least 2, g is 0, v1 is n-1, i is 1, kp is 1, v2 is n-1, I is a function that takes no arguments and returns a list of integers from stdin, R is a function that takes no arguments and returns an integer from stdin, stdin contains 1 input: a string, the current value of r is '=', prev is 0, the output buffer contains "! [0] [n-1]" where 0 is the value of prev and n-1 is the value of v1, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: "? 0 0 1 1", and this is printed: "? 1 1 2 2", and this is printed: "? 2 2 3 3", and so on, until this is printed: "? (n-2) (n-2) (n-1) (n-1)", and this is printed: "? [n-1] [1] [n-1] [0]", and the user input string r is '=' , and this is printed: "? [i] [i] [prev] [prev]" where i is 1 and prev is 0**
