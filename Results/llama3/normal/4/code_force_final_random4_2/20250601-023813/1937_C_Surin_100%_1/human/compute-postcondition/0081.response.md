The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **n is an integer greater than 2, g is 0, v1 is 1, i is 2, kp is 1, v2 is 1, I is a function that takes no arguments and returns a list of integers from stdin, R is a function that takes no arguments and returns an integer from stdin, stdin contains 1 input: a string, if r is '<', then prev is n-1, the output buffer contains "! [n-1] [1]" where n-1 is the value of prev and 1 is the value of v1, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: "? 0 0 1 1".**
