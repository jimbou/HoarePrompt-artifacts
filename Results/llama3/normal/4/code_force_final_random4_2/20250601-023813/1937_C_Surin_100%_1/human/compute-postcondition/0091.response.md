Based on the precondition, we can determine the postcondition as follows:

If `r` is '<', then `v1` is 2, `i` is 3, `kp` is 1, `v2` is 3. In this case, the output buffer contains "! [n-1] [2]" where n-1 is the value of prev and 2 is the value of `v1`, and this is printed: "? 0 0 1 1", and this is printed: "? 1 1 2 2". The code then prints: `? 2 2 3 3`.

If `r` is not '<', then `v1` is 1, `i` is 3, `kp` is 1, `v2` is 3. In this case, the output buffer contains "! [n-1] [1]" where n-1 is the value of prev and 1 is the value of `v1`, and this is printed: "? 0 0 1 1", and this is printed: "? 1 1 2 2". The code then prints: `? 1 1 3 3`.

In both cases, the output buffer is flushed.

Therefore, the postcondition is:

Output: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `g` is 0, `I` is a function that takes no arguments and returns a list of integers from stdin, `R` is a function that takes no arguments and returns an integer from stdin, stdin is empty, `r` is a string, the output buffer is flushed. If `r` is '<', then `v1` is 2, `i` is 3, `kp` is 1, `v2` is 3, the output buffer contains "! [n-1] [2]" where n-1 is the value of prev and 2 is the value of `v1`, and this is printed: "? 0 0 1 1", and this is printed: "? 1 1 2 2", and this is printed: "? 2 2 3 3". Otherwise, `v1` is 1, `i` is 3, `kp` is 1, `v2` is 3, the output buffer contains "! [n-1] [1]" where n-1 is the value of prev and 1 is the value of `v1`, and this is printed: "? 0 0 1 1", and this is printed: "? 1 1 2 2", and this is printed: "? 1 1 3 3".**
