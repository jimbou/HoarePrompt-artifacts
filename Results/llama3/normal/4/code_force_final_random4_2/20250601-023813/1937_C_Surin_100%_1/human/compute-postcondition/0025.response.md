Output State: **n is an integer at least 1, i is n-1, g is 0, v1 is n-1 if the user input string r is '<' for all iterations, otherwise v1 is the last value of v2 for which the user input string r is '<', kp is 0, v2 is n-1, I is a function that takes no arguments and returns a list of integers from stdin, R is a function that takes no arguments and returns an integer from stdin, stdin is empty, and the string "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" has been printed for each iteration where v2 is the current value of i and v1 is the value of v1 from the previous iteration, r is a string entered by the user for each iteration.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

* The value of `n` remains unchanged.
* The value of `i` is now `n-1`, indicating that the loop has executed `n-1` times.
* The value of `g` remains unchanged at 0.
* The value of `v1` depends on the user input string `r` for each iteration. If `r` is '<' for all iterations, then `v1` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `v1` is the last value of `v2` for which `r` is '<'.
* The value of `kp` remains unchanged at 0.
* The value of `v2` is now `n-1`, which is the last value of `i` in the loop.
* The functions `I` and `R` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop.
* The input stream `stdin` is still empty.
* The string "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" has been printed for each iteration, where `v2` is the current value of `i` and `v1` is the value of `v1` from the previous iteration.
* The user input string `r` has been entered for each iteration.
