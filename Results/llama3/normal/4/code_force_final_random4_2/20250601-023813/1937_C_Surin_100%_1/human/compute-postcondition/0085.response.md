Output State: **n is an integer greater than 2, g is 0, v1 is 1, i is 2, kp is 1, v2 is 2, I is a function that takes no arguments and returns a list of integers from stdin, R is a function that takes no arguments and returns an integer from stdin, stdin is empty, r is a string, the output buffer contains "! [n-1] [1]" where n-1 is the value of prev and 1 is the value of v1, the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: "? 0 0 1 1", and this is printed: "? 1 1 2 2"**

Explanation:
The first line flushes the output buffer, which means that any pending output is immediately printed. The second line reads a string from stdin and assigns it to the variable r. Since stdin contains 1 input: a string, this string is read and assigned to r. The value of r is now a string, but its exact value is not specified. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
