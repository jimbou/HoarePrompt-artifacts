Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains one input: an integer (the number of test cases), I is a function that takes no arguments and returns a list of integers from stdin, R is a function that takes no arguments and returns an integer from stdin.
Code of the loop:
for kp in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    g = 0
    v1 = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        v2 = i
        print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
        sys.stdout.flush()
        r = input('')
        if r == '<':
            v1 = v2
    prev = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
        sys.stdout.flush()
        r = input()
        if r == '>':
            prev = i
        elif r == '=':
            print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
            sys.stdout.flush()
            r2 = input('')
            if r2 == '<':
                prev = i
    print(f'! {prev} {v1}')
    sys.stdout.flush()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is at least 1, `i` is `n`, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1` if the user input string `r` is '<' for all iterations, otherwise `v1` is the last value of `v2` for which the user input string `r` is '<', `kp` is 0, `v2` is `n-1`, `I` is a function that takes no arguments and returns a list of integers from stdin, `R` is a function that takes no arguments and returns an integer from stdin, stdin contains 0 inputs if the user input string `r` is '>', otherwise stdin is empty, `r` is the user input string, and `prev` is `n-1` if the user input string `r` is '<', `n-2` if the user input string `r` is '>', otherwise `prev` is 0 if the user input string `r` is '=' , and this is printed: "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is the value of prev and v1 is the value of v1, and the output buffer is flushed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The output buffer is flushed, the loop finishes executing when `i` reaches `n`, at which point `prev` is updated to `n-1` if the user input string `r` is '>', otherwise it remains unchanged, and the output buffer contains "! [prev] [n-1]" where `prev` is the updated value and `n-1` is the value of `v1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The output buffer is flushed, the loop finishes executing when `i` reaches `n`, at which point `prev` is updated based on the values of `r` and `r2`, and the output buffer contains "! [0] [n-1]" where `n-1` is the value of `v1`, `kp` is increased by 1 and the value returned by `int(input())` must be greater than `kp`, `n` is an integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`. If `r` is '>', then `prev` is updated to `n-1`. If `r` is not '>', then `prev` is updated based on the value of `r2`: if `r2` is '<', then `prev` is updated to `n-1` if `r` is '=', otherwise `prev` is updated to `n-2`; if `r2` is not '<', then `prev` is updated to `n-2` if `r` is not '=', otherwise `prev` is updated to `n-1`. The output buffer also contains various printed messages based on the values of `r` and `r2`, and this is printed: "! [prev] [n-1]" where prev is the value of `prev` which is either `n-1` or `n-2` depending on the values of `r` and `r2`, and `n-1` is the value of `v1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
