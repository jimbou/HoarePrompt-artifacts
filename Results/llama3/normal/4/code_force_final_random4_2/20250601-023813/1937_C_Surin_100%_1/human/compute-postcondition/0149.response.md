Output State: **The output buffer is flushed, the loop finishes executing when `i` reaches `n`, at which point `prev` is updated to `n-1` if the user input string `r` is '>', otherwise it remains unchanged, and the output buffer contains "! [prev] [n-1]" where `prev` is the updated value and `n-1` is the value of `v1`, `kp` is increased by 1 and the value returned by `int(input())` must be greater than `kp`, `n` is an integer and is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 1, `i` is 1, `v2` is 1, and this is printed: "? 0 0 1 1", `r` is a user input string and the current value of `r` is '<'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The output buffer is flushed, and the loop finishes executing when `i` reaches `n`. The output buffer contains "! [prev] [n-1]" where `prev` is the updated value and `n-1` is the value of `v1`. The value of `kp` is increased by 1 and the value returned by `int(input())` must be greater than `kp`. The values of `n`, `g`, `i`, `v2`, and `r` remain unchanged. The value of `v1` is updated to 1, which is the value of `v2`.
