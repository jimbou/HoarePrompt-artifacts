Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer at least 1, g is 0, v1 is 0, kp is 0, I is a function that takes no arguments and returns a list of integers from stdin, R is a function that takes no arguments and returns an integer from stdin, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    v2 = i
    print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
    sys.stdout.flush()
    r = input('')
    if r == '<':
        v1 = v2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer greater than 1, i is 1, g is 0, v1 is 1 if the user input string r is '<', otherwise v1 is 0, kp is 0, v2 is 1, I is a function that takes no arguments and returns a list of integers from stdin, R is a function that takes no arguments and returns an integer from stdin, stdin is empty, and the string "? 0 0 1 1" has been printed, r is a string entered by the user.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer greater than 2, i is 2, g is 0, I is a function that takes no arguments and returns a list of integers from stdin, R is a function that takes no arguments and returns an integer from stdin, stdin is empty, and the string "? 0 0 1 1" has been printed, r is a string entered by the user, and this is printed: "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" where v2 is 2, and v1 is 2 if the user input string r is '<', otherwise v1 is 0, kp is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer greater than 3, i is 3, g is 0, I is a function that takes no arguments and returns a list of integers from stdin, R is a function that takes no arguments and returns an integer from stdin, stdin is empty, the string "? 0 0 1 1" has been printed, r is a string entered by the user, the string "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" has been printed where v2 is 3, and v1 is 2 if the user input string r is '<', otherwise v1 is 0, kp is 0, v2 is 3, and this is printed: "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" where v2 is 3, and v1 is 2 if the user input string r is '<', otherwise v1 is 0, r is a new string entered by the user. If the new string r is '<', then v1 is 3. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
