Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is 2, `i` is 2, `kp` is 1, `v2` is 2, `I` is a function that takes no arguments and returns a list of integers from stdin, `R` is a function that takes no arguments and returns an integer from stdin, stdin is empty, `r` is a string, the output buffer contains "! [n-1] [2]" where n-1 is the value of prev and 2 is the value of v1, the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: "? 0 0 1 1", and this is printed: "? 1 1 2 2"**

In this output state, the value of `v1` has been updated to 2, which is the value of `v2`. The other variables remain unchanged. The output buffer and printed messages also remain the same.
