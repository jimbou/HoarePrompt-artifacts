Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 2, g is 0, I is a function that takes no arguments and returns a list of integers from stdin, R is a function that takes no arguments and returns an integer from stdin, stdin is empty, r is a string, the output buffer is flushed. If r is '<', then v1 is 2, i is 2, kp is 1, v2 is 2, the output buffer contains "! [n-1] [2]" where n-1 is the value of prev and 2 is the value of v1, and this is printed: "? 0 0 1 1", and this is printed: "? 1 1 2 2". Otherwise, v1 is 1, i is 2, kp is 1, v2 is 2, the output buffer contains "! [n-1] [1]" where n-1 is the value of prev and 1 is the value of v1, and this is printed: "? 0 0 1 1", and this is printed: "? 1 1 2 2".***
