Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is 1 if the user input string `r` is '<', otherwise `v1` is 0, `kp` is 0, `v2` is 2, `I` is a function that takes no arguments and returns a list of integers from stdin, `R` is a function that takes no arguments and returns an integer from stdin, stdin is empty, and the string "? 0 0 1 1" has been printed, `r` is a string entered by the user.**

In this output state, the value of `v2` has been updated to 2, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The program has not interacted with the user or stdin, so the input string `r` and the functions `I` and `R` are still in the same state. The string "? 0 0 1 1" has already been printed, and there are no changes to the stdin.
