Output State: **The output buffer is flushed, the loop finishes executing when `i` reaches `n`, at which point `prev` is updated to `n-1` if the user input string `r` is '>', otherwise it remains unchanged, and the output buffer contains "! [prev] [n-1]" where `prev` is the updated value and `n-1` is the value of `v1`, `kp` is increased by 1 and the value returned by `int(input())` must be greater than `kp`, `n` is an integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, and this is printed: "? 0 0 1 1", `r` is a user input string. If the current value of `r` is '<', then the value of `v1` is `n-1`, and this is printed: "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" where v1 is `n-2` and v2 is `n-1`, and `r` is assigned the value of the user input string.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: The loop has finished executing when `i` reaches `n`. The output buffer is flushed, and the output buffer contains "! [prev] [n-1]" where `prev` is the updated value and `n-1` is the value of `v1`. The value of `v1` is `n-1` if the user input string `r` is '<', otherwise it remains unchanged. The loop has printed "? 0 0 1 1" and "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" where v1 is `n-2` and v2 is `n-1` if the current value of `r` is '<'. The value of `kp` is increased by 1, and the value returned by `int(input())` must be greater than `kp`. The values of `n`, `g`, `i`, and `v2` are `n`, 0, `n-1`, and `n-1` respectively.
