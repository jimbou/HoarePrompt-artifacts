Based on the precondition, let's break down the values of the variables and objects that will be printed:

* `v1` is `n-1`, which is the value of `v1` when the current value of `r` is '<'.
* `i` is 1, which is the current value of the loop counter.
* `v1` (again) is `n-1`, which is the same value as before.
* `prev` is 0, which is the value of `prev` after the loop finishes executing.

Now, let's put these values together in the print statement:

`print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')`

This will print:

`? [n-1] 1 [n-1] 0`

Where `[n-1]` represents the value of `v1`, which is `n-1`.

Output: **? [n-1] 1 [n-1] 0 (where [n-1] is the value of v1, which is n-1)**
