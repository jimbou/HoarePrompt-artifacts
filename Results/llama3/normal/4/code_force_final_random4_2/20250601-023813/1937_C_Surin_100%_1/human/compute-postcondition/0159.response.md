Output State: **The output buffer is flushed, the loop finishes executing when `i` reaches `n`, at which point `prev` is updated to `n-1` if the user input string `r` is '>', otherwise it remains unchanged, and the output buffer contains "! [prev] [n-1]" where `prev` is the updated value and `n-1` is the value of `v1`, `kp` is increased by 1 and the value returned by `int(input())` must be greater than `kp`, `n` is an integer and is greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is 1 if `r` is '<', otherwise it is 2, `i` is 3, `v2` is 3, and this is printed: "? 0 0 1 1", `r` is a user input string. If the current value of `r` is '<', then the value of `v1` is 2, and this is printed: "? 1 1 2 2", and `r` is assigned the value of the user input string.**

In this output state, the value of `v2` has been updated to 3, which is the current value of `i`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
