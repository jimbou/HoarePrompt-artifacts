Correctness: **True**.

The program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and code. It uses a binary search approach to find the maximum XOR value between two indices in the secret sequence. The program first finds the index with the maximum value by comparing each index with itself, and then finds the index that produces the maximum XOR value with the previously found index.

The program uses at most 3n queries, which is within the allowed limit. It also correctly handles the case where n = 2, where the maximum XOR value is always 1.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program seems to be correctly implemented and should produce the correct output for all possible inputs.
