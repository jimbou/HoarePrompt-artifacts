Output: **The output buffer is flushed, the loop finishes executing when `i` reaches `n`, at which point `prev` is updated to 0, and the output buffer contains "! [0] [n-1]" where `n-1` is the value of `v1`, `kp` is increased by 1 and the value returned by `int(input())` must be greater than `kp`, `n` is an integer and must be at least 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is 1, `v2` is `n-1`, and this is printed: "? 0 0 1 1", `r` is a user input string. If the current value of `r` is '<', then the value of `v1` is `n-1`, and this is printed: "? [n-1] [n-1] [n-1] [n-1]" where `r` is assigned the value of the user input string, and this is printed: "? [n-1] [1] [n-1] [0]"**
