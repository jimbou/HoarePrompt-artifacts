Based on the precondition, the print statement will print a formatted string with the values of `v1` and `v2`.

The value of `v1` is 1, as specified in the precondition.

The value of `v2` is 2, as specified in the precondition.

Therefore, the print statement will output the string "? 1 1 2 2".

Output: **? 1 1 2 2**
