The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains unchanged. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` is the old value plus 1.
State: **prev is updated according to the user input string r, i is the old value of i plus 1, n remains unchanged, the string "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" is printed to the console, r is the user's input, and the console is flushed. If r equals '>', then prev is equal to i. If r equals '=', then the string "? [i] [i] [prev] [prev]" is printed to the console, r2 is the user's input. If r2 equals '<', then prev is updated to the current value of i. If r does not equal '=' or '>', then no additional actions are performed.**
