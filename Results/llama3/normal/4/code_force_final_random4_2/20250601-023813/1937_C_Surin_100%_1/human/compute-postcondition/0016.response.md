Output State: **n is an integer greater than 2, i is 2, g is 0, v1 is 2, kp is 0, v2 is 2, I is a function that takes no arguments and returns a list of integers from stdin, R is a function that takes no arguments and returns an integer from stdin, stdin is empty, and the string "? 0 0 1 1" has been printed, r is a string entered by the user, and this is printed: "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" where v1 is 2 and v2 is 2, r is a string entered by the user**

In this output state, the value of v1 has been updated to be equal to v2, which is 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The program has not read any input from stdin, and the previously printed strings remain the same. The functions I and R are still available, but their behavior has not been affected by the code.
