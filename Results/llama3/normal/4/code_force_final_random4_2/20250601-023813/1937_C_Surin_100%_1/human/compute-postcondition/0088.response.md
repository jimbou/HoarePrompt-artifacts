The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `g` is 0, `I` is a function that takes no arguments and returns a list of integers from stdin, `R` is a function that takes no arguments and returns an integer from stdin, stdin is empty, `r` is a string, the output buffer is flushed. If `r` is '<', then `v1` is 2, `i` is 3, `kp` is 1, `v2` is 2, the output buffer contains "! [n-1] [2]" where n-1 is the value of prev and 2 is the value of `v1`, and this is printed: "? 0 0 1 1", and this is printed: "? 1 1 2 2". Otherwise, `v1` is 1, `i` is 3, `kp` is 1, `v2` is 2, the output buffer contains "! [n-1] [1]" where n-1 is the value of prev and 1 is the value of `v1`, and this is printed: "? 0 0 1 1", and this is printed: "? 1 1 2 2".**
