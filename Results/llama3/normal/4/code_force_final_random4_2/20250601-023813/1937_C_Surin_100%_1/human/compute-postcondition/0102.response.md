Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is 1, `kp` is 1, `v2` is `n-1`, `I` is a function that takes no arguments and returns a list of integers from stdin, `R` is a function that takes no arguments and returns an integer from stdin, stdin contains 1 input: a string, the current value of `r` is '>', `prev` is 1, the output buffer contains "! [0] [n-1]" where 0 is the value of the old `prev` and `n-1` is the value of `v1`, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: "? 0 0 1 1", and this is printed: "? 1 1 2 2", and this is printed: "? 2 2 3 3", and so on, until this is printed: "? (n-2) (n-2) (n-1) (n-1)", and this is printed: "? [n-1] [1] [n-1] [0]"**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `prev` has been updated to 1, which is the current value of `i`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
