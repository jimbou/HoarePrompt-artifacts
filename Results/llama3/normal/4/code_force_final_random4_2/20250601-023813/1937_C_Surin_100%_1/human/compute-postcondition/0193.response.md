Postcondition: **The output buffer is flushed, the loop finishes executing when `i` reaches `n`, at which point `prev` is updated based on the values of `r` and `r2`, and the output buffer contains "! [0] [n-1]" where `n-1` is the value of `v1`, `kp` is increased by 1 and the value returned by `int(input())` must be greater than `kp`, `n` is an integer and must be at least 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is 2, `v2` is `n-1`. If `r` is '=', then `prev` is updated to 2 if `r2` is '<', otherwise `prev` is updated to 1 if `r` is '>', otherwise `prev` is updated to 0 if `r2` is not '<', otherwise `prev` is updated to 1. If `r` is not '=', then `prev` is updated to 1 if `r` is '>', otherwise `prev` is updated to 0 if `r2` is not '<', otherwise `prev` is updated to 1. The output buffer also contains various printed messages based on the values of `r` and `r2`.**
