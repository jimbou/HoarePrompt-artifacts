Output State: **n is an integer greater than 3, g is 0, I is a function that takes no arguments and returns a list of integers from stdin, R is a function that takes no arguments and returns an integer from stdin, stdin contains 1 input: a string, r is a string, the output buffer is flushed. If r is '<', then v1 is 3, i is 3, kp is 1, v2 is 3, the output buffer contains "! [n-1] [3]" where n-1 is the value of prev and 3 is the value of v1, and this is printed: "? 0 0 1 1", and this is printed: "? 1 1 2 2", and this is printed: "? 2 2 3 3". Otherwise, v1 is 3, i is 3, kp is 1, v2 is 3, the output buffer contains "! [n-1] [3]" where n-1 is the value of prev and 3 is the value of v1, and this is printed: "? 0 0 1 1", and this is printed: "? 1 1 2 2", and this is printed: "? 1 1 3 3".**

In this output state, the value of v1 has been updated to be equal to v2, which is 3. The other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
