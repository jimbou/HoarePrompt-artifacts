Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `g` is 0, `I` is a function that takes no arguments and returns a list of integers from stdin, `R` is a function that takes no arguments and returns an integer from stdin, `stdin` is empty, the string "? 0 0 1 1" has been printed, `r` is a string entered by the user, the string "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" has been printed where `v2` is 3, and `v1` is 2 if the user input string `r` is '<', otherwise `v1` is 0, `kp` is 0, `v2` is 3.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `v2` has been updated to 3, which is the current value of `i`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
