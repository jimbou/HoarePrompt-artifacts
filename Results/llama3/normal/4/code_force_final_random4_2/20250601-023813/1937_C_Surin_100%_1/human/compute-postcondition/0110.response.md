Postcondition: **The program's state is updated based on the value of `r2`. If `r2` is '<', then `prev` is updated to 1, and the output buffer and user input string `r` are updated accordingly. If `r2` is not '<', the program's state remains unchanged, with `prev` still being 0. In both cases, the program's output buffer and user input string `r` are updated with the same sequence of prints, and the program's functions `I` and `R` remain unchanged.**
