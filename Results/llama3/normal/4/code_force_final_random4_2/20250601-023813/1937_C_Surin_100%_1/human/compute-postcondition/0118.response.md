Based on the precondition, the code will print a string in the format '? [i] [i] [prev] [prev]', where [i] is the current value of the variable i, and [prev] is the current value of the variable prev.

Since i is incremented by 1, its current value is i + 1.

The variable prev is updated according to the user input string r. However, the exact value of prev is not specified in the precondition. Therefore, we can only describe its value as "the updated value of prev based on the user input string r".

Output: **? [i + 1] [i + 1] [the updated value of prev based on the user input string r] [the updated value of prev based on the user input string r]**
