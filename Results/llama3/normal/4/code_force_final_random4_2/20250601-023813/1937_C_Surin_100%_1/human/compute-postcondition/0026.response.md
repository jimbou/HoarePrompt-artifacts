Output State: **`n` is an integer at least 1, `i` is `n-1`, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1` if the user input string `r` is '<' for all iterations, otherwise `v1` is the last value of `v2` for which the user input string `r` is '<', `kp` is 0, `v2` is `n-1`, `I` is a function that takes no arguments and returns a list of integers from stdin, `R` is a function that takes no arguments and returns an integer from stdin, stdin is empty, the string "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" has been printed for each iteration where `v2` is the current value of `i` and `v1` is the value of `v1` from the previous iteration, `r` is a string entered by the user for each iteration, and `prev` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `prev` that has been assigned the value 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
