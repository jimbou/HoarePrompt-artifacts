Output State: **stdin contains one input: an integer (the number of test cases), I is a function that takes no arguments and returns a list of integers from stdin, R is a function that takes no arguments and returns an integer from stdin.**

The first line defines a function I that takes no arguments and returns a list of integers from stdin, split by spaces. The second line defines a function R that takes no arguments and returns an integer from stdin. These functions do not modify any variables or the state of stdin. They only define new functions that can be used later in the code.
