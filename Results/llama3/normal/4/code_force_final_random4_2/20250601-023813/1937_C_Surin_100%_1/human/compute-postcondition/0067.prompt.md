Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer at least 1, `i` is `n-1`, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1` if the user input string `r` is '<' for all iterations, otherwise `v1` is the last value of `v2` for which the user input string `r` is '<', `kp` is 0, `v2` is `n-1`, `I` is a function that takes no arguments and returns a list of integers from stdin, `R` is a function that takes no arguments and returns an integer from stdin, stdin is empty, the string "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" has been printed for each iteration where `v2` is the current value of `i` and `v1` is the value of `v1` from the previous iteration, `r` is a string entered by the user for each iteration, and `prev` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
    sys.stdout.flush()
    r = input()
    if r == '>':
        prev = i
    elif r == '=':
        print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
        sys.stdout.flush()
        r2 = input('')
        if r2 == '<':
            prev = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is at least 2, i is 1, g is 0, v1 is n-1 if the user input string r is '<' for all iterations, otherwise v1 is the last value of v2 for which the user input string r is '<', kp is 0, v2 is n-1, I is a function that takes no arguments and returns a list of integers from stdin, R is a function that takes no arguments and returns an integer from stdin, stdin is empty, the string "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" has been printed for each iteration where v2 is the current value of i and v1 is the value of v1 from the previous iteration, r is a string entered by the user for each iteration, and prev is 1 if the user input string r is '>', otherwise prev is 0 if the user input string r is '=', and the string "? [i] [i] [prev] [prev]" is printed where i is the current value of i and prev is the current value of prev, and r2 is a string entered by the user for this iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is at least 2, i is 2, g is 0, v1 is n-1 if the user input string r is '<' for all iterations, otherwise v1 is the last value of v2 for which the user input string r is '<', kp is 0, v2 is n-1, I is a function that takes no arguments and returns a list of integers from stdin, R is a function that takes no arguments and returns an integer from stdin, stdin contains 0 inputs if the user input string r is '>', otherwise stdin is empty, r is a string entered by the user for this iteration, and prev is 2 if the user input string r is '<' or '>', otherwise prev is 0 if the user input string r is '='.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is at least 3, i is 3, g is 0, v1 is n-1 if the user input string r is '<' for all iterations, otherwise v1 is the last value of v2 for which the user input string r is '<', kp is 0, v2 is n-1, I is a function that takes no arguments and returns a list of integers from stdin, R is a function that takes no arguments and returns an integer from stdin, stdin contains 0 inputs if the user input string r is '>', otherwise stdin is empty, r is the user input string, and prev is 3 if the user input string r is '<', 2 if the user input string r is '>', otherwise prev is 0 if the user input string r is '='.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
