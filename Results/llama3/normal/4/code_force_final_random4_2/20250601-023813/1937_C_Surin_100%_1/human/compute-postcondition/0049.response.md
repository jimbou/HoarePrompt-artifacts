Output: **n is at least 2, i is 2, g is 0, v1 is n-1 if the user input string r is '<' for all iterations, otherwise v1 is the last value of v2 for which the user input string r is '<', kp is 0, v2 is n-1, I is a function that takes no arguments and returns a list of integers from stdin, R is a function that takes no arguments and returns an integer from stdin, stdin is empty, r is a string entered by the user for this iteration, and prev is 1 if the user input string r is '>', otherwise prev is 0 if the user input string r is '=', and this is printed: "? 2 2 [prev] [prev]" where [prev] is 1 if the user input string r is '>', otherwise [prev] is 0 if the user input string r is '='**
