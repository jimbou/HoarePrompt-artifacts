Output State: **The output buffer is flushed, the loop finishes executing when `i` reaches `n`, at which point `prev` is updated to `n-1` if the user input string `r` is '>', otherwise it remains unchanged, and the output buffer contains "! [prev] [n-1]" where `prev` is the updated value and `n-1` is the value of `v1`, `kp` is increased by 1 and the value returned by `int(input())` must be greater than `kp`, `n` is an integer and is greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is 3, `i` is 3, `v2` is 3, and this is printed: "? 0 0 1 1", `r` is a user input string. If the current value of `r` is '<', then the value of `v1` is 3, and this is printed: "? 1 1 2 2", and `r` is assigned the value of the user input string. and this is printed: "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" where v1 is 3 and v2 is 3.**

In natural language, the output state is: The output buffer is flushed, and the loop finishes executing when `i` reaches `n`. The value of `prev` is updated to `n-1` if the user input string `r` is '>', otherwise it remains unchanged. The output buffer contains "! [prev] [n-1]" where `prev` is the updated value and `n-1` is the value of `v1`. The value of `kp` is increased by 1, and the value returned by `int(input())` must be greater than `kp`. The value of `n` is an integer and is greater than 3, and the value of `g` is 0. The value of `v1` is 3, and the value of `i` is 3. The value of `v2` is 3. The strings "? 0 0 1 1", "? 1 1 2 2", and "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" are printed, where `v1` is 3 and `v2` is 3.
