Reasoning: The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the maximum and second-maximum values in the permutation using a series of queries to the input stream. The program uses a binary search-like approach to find the maximum value, and then uses another series of queries to find the second-maximum value. The program also correctly handles the case where the maximum and second-maximum values are the same. The program's output is also in the correct format, as specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
