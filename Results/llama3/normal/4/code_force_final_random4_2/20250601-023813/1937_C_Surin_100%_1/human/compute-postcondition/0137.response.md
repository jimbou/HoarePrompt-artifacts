Output State: **The loop finishes executing when `i` reaches `n`, at which point `prev` is updated to `n-1` if the user input string `r` is '>', otherwise it remains unchanged. The output buffer contains "! [prev] [n-1]" where `prev` is the updated value and `n-1` is the value of `v1`, and the output buffer is flushed.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop finishes executing, the value of `prev` will be updated to `n-1` if the user input string `r` is '>', otherwise it will remain unchanged. The output buffer will contain the string "! [prev] [n-1]" where `prev` is the updated value and `n-1` is the value of `v1`, and the output buffer will be flushed.
