Output State: **n is at least 1, i is n, g is 0, v1 is n-1 if the user input string r is '<' for all iterations, otherwise v1 is the last value of v2 for which the user input string r is '<', kp is 0, v2 is n-1, I is a function that takes no arguments and returns a list of integers from stdin, R is a function that takes no arguments and returns an integer from stdin, stdin contains 0 inputs if the user input string r is '>', otherwise stdin is empty, r is the user input string, and prev is n-1 if the user input string r is '<', n-2 if the user input string r is '>', otherwise prev is 0 if the user input string r is '='.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all iterations, and the values of the variables have been updated accordingly. The loop counter `i` has reached its final value `n`, and the other variables have been updated based on the user input string `r`. The state of the other variables that are not affected by the loop head and body remains unchanged.
