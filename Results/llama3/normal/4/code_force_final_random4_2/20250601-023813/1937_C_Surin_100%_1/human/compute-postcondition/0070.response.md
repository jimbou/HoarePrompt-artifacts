Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is `n`, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1` if the user input string `r` is '<' for all iterations, otherwise `v1` is the last value of `v2` for which the user input string `r` is '<', `kp` is 0, `v2` is `n-1`, `I` is a function that takes no arguments and returns a list of integers from stdin, `R` is a function that takes no arguments and returns an integer from stdin, stdin contains 0 inputs if the user input string `r` is '>', otherwise stdin is empty, `r` is the user input string, and `prev` is `n-1` if the user input string `r` is '<', `n-2` if the user input string `r` is '>', otherwise `prev` is 0 if the user input string `r` is '=' , and this is printed: "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is the value of prev and v1 is the value of v1, and the output buffer is flushed.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that the output buffer is flushed, meaning that any pending output is immediately printed to the console. The values of the variables remain unchanged, and the stdin and functions `I` and `R` are also unaffected. The only change is that the output buffer is cleared, ensuring that any printed output is immediately visible.
