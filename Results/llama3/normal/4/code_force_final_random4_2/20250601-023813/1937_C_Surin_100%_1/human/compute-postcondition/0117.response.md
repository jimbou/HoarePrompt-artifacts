The value of `prev` is updated to be equal to `i`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The string "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" is still printed to the console, and the console is still flushed. The user's input `r` is still the same.

Output State: **`prev` is equal to `i`, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains unchanged, the string "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" is printed to the console, `r` is the user's input, and the console is flushed.**
