Output State: **The output buffer is flushed, the loop finishes executing when `i` reaches `n`, at which point `prev` is updated to `n-1` if the user input string `r` is '>', otherwise it remains unchanged, and the output buffer contains "! [prev] [n-1]" where `prev` is the updated value and `n-1` is the value of `v1`, `kp` is increased by 1 and the value returned by `int(input())` must be greater than `kp`, `n` is an integer and is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `i` is 1, `v2` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `v2` has been updated to 1, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions for the loop and output buffer are still valid.
