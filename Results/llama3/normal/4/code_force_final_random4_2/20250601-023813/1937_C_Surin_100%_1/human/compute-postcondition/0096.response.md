Output State: **`n` is an integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `kp` is 1, `v2` is `n-1`, `I` is a function that takes no arguments and returns a list of integers from stdin, `R` is a function that takes no arguments and returns an integer from stdin, stdin contains 0 inputs, `r` is the user input string, `prev` is 0, the output buffer contains "! [0] [n-1]" where 0 is the value of `prev` and `n-1` is the value of `v1`, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: "? 0 0 1 1", and this is printed: "? 1 1 2 2", and this is printed: "? 2 2 3 3", and so on, until this is printed: "? (n-2) (n-2) (n-1) (n-1)"**

In this output state, the value of `prev` has been changed to 0, while the values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The output buffer still contains the string "! [0] [n-1]" and the output buffer is still flushed. The same print statements are still printed as in the initial state.
