Postcondition: **The program's state is updated based on the user input string `r`. If `r` is '>', the program updates `prev` to 1 and prints a series of strings in the format "? [i] [i] [i+1] [i+1]" until `i` reaches `n-1`, and then prints "? [n-1] [1] [n-1] [0]". If `r` is '=', `prev` is updated to 1 if the next input `r2` is '<', otherwise `prev` remains 0. In all cases, the output buffer contains "! [prev] [n-1]" where `prev` is the updated value and `n-1` is the value of `v1`, and the output buffer is flushed. If `r` is neither '>' nor '=', the program's state remains unchanged.**
