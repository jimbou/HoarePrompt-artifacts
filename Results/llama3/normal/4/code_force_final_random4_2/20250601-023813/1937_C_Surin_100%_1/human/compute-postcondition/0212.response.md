Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1. For each test case, the function determines the maximum and second-maximum values in the permutation and prints them to standard output in the format "! max second_max". The function uses a series of queries to the input stream to compare elements of the permutation and determine the maximum and second-maximum values. The function repeats this process for each test case until the input is exhausted.**
