Output State: **prev is updated to the current value of i, i is incremented by 1, n remains unchanged, the string "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" is printed to the console, r is the user's input, the console is flushed, the string "? [i] [i] [prev] [prev]" is printed to the console, and r2 is the user's input**

In this output state, the value of `prev` has been updated to the current value of `i`, which means `prev` now holds the same value as `i`. The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, but its previous value is now stored in `prev`. The value of `n` remains unchanged. The rest of the state remains the same, with the same strings printed to the console, the console flushed, and the same user inputs `r` and `r2`.
