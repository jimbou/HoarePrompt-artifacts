Postcondition: **The output buffer is flushed, the loop finishes executing when `i` reaches `n`, at which point `prev` is updated based on the values of `r` and `r2`, and the output buffer contains "! [0] [n-1]" where `n-1` is the value of `v1`, `kp` is increased by 1 and the value returned by `int(input())` must be greater than `kp`, `n` is an integer and must be at least 4, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is 3, `v2` is `n-1`. The output buffer also contains various printed messages based on the values of `r` and `r2`. If `r2` equals '<', then `prev` is updated to 3 and the output buffer contains "? [3] [3] [3] [3]". Otherwise, the state of `prev` and the output buffer remains unchanged. Additionally, `r2` is updated to the value of the input string.**
