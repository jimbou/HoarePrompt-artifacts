Output State: **n is an integer, g is 0, v1 is n-1, i is n, kp is 1, v2 is n-1, I is a function that takes no arguments and returns a list of integers from stdin, R is a function that takes no arguments and returns an integer from stdin, stdin contains 0 inputs, r is the user input string, and prev is 0 if the user input string r is '=', otherwise prev is n-1 if the user input string r is '<', otherwise prev is n-2 if the user input string r is '>', and the output buffer contains "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is the value of prev and v1 is the value of v1, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: "? 0 0 1 1", and this is printed: "? 1 1 2 2", and this is printed: "? 2 2 3 3", and so on, until this is printed: "? (n-2) (n-2) (n-1) (n-1)".**

The loop executes until i is equal to n. In each iteration, v2 is set to the current value of i, and the program prints a string to the output buffer and flushes it. The program then reads a string from stdin and checks if it is '<'. If it is, v1 is set to the current value of v2. After the loop finishes, v1 is equal to n-1, and the output buffer contains the string "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is the value of prev and v1 is the value of v1. The output buffer is flushed, and the program has printed a series of strings to the output buffer, each of the form "? (i-1) (i-1) i i" for i ranging from 1 to n-1.
