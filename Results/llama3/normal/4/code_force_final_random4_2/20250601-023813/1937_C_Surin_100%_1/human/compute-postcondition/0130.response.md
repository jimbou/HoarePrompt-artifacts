The code prints a formatted string containing the values of `i`, `i`, `prev`, and `prev`. 

Here, `i` is the old value of `i` plus 1, and `prev` is the updated value according to the user input string `r`. 

Since the exact value of `i` and `prev` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `i` and `prev`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the updated value of `i` and `prev`.

Output: **? [i] [i] [prev] [prev] (where i is the old value of i plus 1 and prev is the updated value according to the user input string r)**
