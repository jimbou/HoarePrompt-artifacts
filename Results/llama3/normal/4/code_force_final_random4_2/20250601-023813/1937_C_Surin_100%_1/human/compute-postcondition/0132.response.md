Output State: **prev is updated according to the user input string r2, i is the old value of i plus 1, n remains unchanged, and this is printed: "? [i] [i] [prev] [prev]" , where i is the old value of i plus 1, and prev is the updated value according to the user input string r2, sys.stdout is flushed, and r2 is the user input string.**

In this final state, the value of `prev` has been updated based on the user's input string `r2`, which was obtained through the `input()` function. The value of `i` remains the old value of `i` plus 1, as it was before the code execution. The value of `n` remains unchanged. The print statement has been executed, displaying the specified string with the updated values of `i` and `prev`. The `sys.stdout.flush()` function has been called, ensuring that the output is displayed immediately. The user input string `r2` is now stored in the variable `r2`.
