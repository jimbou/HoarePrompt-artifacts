Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `g` is 0, `I` is a function that takes no arguments and returns a list of integers from stdin, `R` is a function that takes no arguments and returns an integer from stdin, stdin is empty, `r` is a string, the output buffer is flushed. If `r` is '<', then `v1` is 2, `i` is 3, `kp` is 1, `v2` is 3, the output buffer contains "! [n-1] [2]" where n-1 is the value of prev and 2 is the value of `v1`, and this is printed: "? 0 0 1 1", and this is printed: "? 1 1 2 2". Otherwise, `v1` is 1, `i` is 3, `kp` is 1, `v2` is 3, the output buffer contains "! [n-1] [1]" where n-1 is the value of prev and 1 is the value of `v1`, and this is printed: "? 0 0 1 1", and this is printed: "? 1 1 2 2".**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `v2` has been updated to be equal to the value of `i`, which is 3. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
