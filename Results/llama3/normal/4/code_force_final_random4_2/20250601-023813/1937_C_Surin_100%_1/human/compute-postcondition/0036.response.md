Output: **n is at least 2, i is 1, g is 0, v1 is n-1 if the user input string r is '<' for all iterations, otherwise v1 is the last value of v2 for which the user input string r is '<', kp is 0, v2 is n-1, I is a function that takes no arguments and returns a list of integers from stdin, R is a function that takes no arguments and returns an integer from stdin, stdin is empty, the string "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" has been printed for each iteration where v2 is the current value of i and v1 is the value of v1 from the previous iteration, r is a string entered by the user for each iteration, and prev is 0, and this is printed: "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is the current value of v1 and i is the current value of i and prev is the current value of prev, r is a string entered by the user for this iteration, and the user input string r is not '>' and the current value of r is '=', and this is printed: "? [i] [i] [prev] [prev]" where i is the current value of i and prev is the current value of prev**
