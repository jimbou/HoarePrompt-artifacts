Output State: **n is an integer, g is 0, v1 is 0, i is n, kp is 1, v2 is n-1, I is a function that takes no arguments and returns a list of integers from stdin, R is a function that takes no arguments and returns an integer from stdin, stdin contains 0 inputs, r is the user input string, and prev is 0 if the user input string r is '=', otherwise prev is n-1 if the user input string r is '<', otherwise prev is n-2 if the user input string r is '>', and the output buffer contains "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is the value of prev and v1 is the value of v1, and the output buffer is flushed.**

The code snippet modifies the initial state by assigning the integer value of the input to `n`, resetting `g` to 0, and resetting `v1` to 0. The values of `i`, `kp`, `v2`, `I`, `R`, `r`, and `prev` remain unchanged. The output buffer now contains the string "! [prev] [v1]" where `prev` is the value of `prev` and `v1` is the value of `v1`, and the output buffer is flushed.
