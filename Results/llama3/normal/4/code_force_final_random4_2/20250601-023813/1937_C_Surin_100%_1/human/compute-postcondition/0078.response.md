Postcondition: **n is an integer greater than 1, g is 0, v1 is 0, i is 1, kp is 1, v2 is 1, I is a function that takes no arguments and returns a list of integers from stdin, R is a function that takes no arguments and returns an integer from stdin, stdin contains 1 input: a string, r is '<', prev was n-1, the output buffer contains "! [n-1] [v1]" where n-1 is the value of prev and v1 is the value of v1, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: "? 0 0 1 1"**
