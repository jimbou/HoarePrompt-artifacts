Based on the precondition, the value of `v1` and `v2` depends on the value of `r`. If `r` is '<', then `v1` is 2 and `v2` is 3. Otherwise, `v1` is 1 and `v2` is 3.

Since the exact value of `r` is not provided, we can't determine the exact values of `v1` and `v2`. However, we can describe the output based on the two possible scenarios.

If `r` is '<', the output will be '? 2 2 3 3'.

If `r` is not '<', the output will be '? 1 1 3 3'.

Therefore, the output will be either '? 2 2 3 3' or '? 1 1 3 3', depending on the value of `r`.

Output: **? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2] (where v1 is 2 if r is '<', otherwise v1 is 1, and v2 is 3)**
