Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `kp` is 0, `v2` is 1, `I` is a function that takes no arguments and returns a list of integers from stdin, `R` is a function that takes no arguments and returns an integer from stdin, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `v2` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The functions `I` and `R` are still available, and the stdin is still empty.
