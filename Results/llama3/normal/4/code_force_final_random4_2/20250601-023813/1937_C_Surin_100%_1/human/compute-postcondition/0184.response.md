Output: **? [n-1] [2] [n-1] [prev]**.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the output:

*   `v1` is `n-1`, so it will print the value of `n-1`.
*   `i` is 2, so it will print 2.
*   `v1` is `n-1`, so it will print the value of `n-1` again.
*   `prev` is updated based on the value of `r` and `r2`. Since the current value of `r` is '<', `prev` is updated to 1. However, the problem statement does not provide the value of `r2`, so we cannot determine the exact value of `prev`. Therefore, we describe it as `prev`.

So, the output will be "? [n-1] [2] [n-1] [prev]", where `n-1` is the value of `v1` and `prev` is the updated value based on the conditions.
