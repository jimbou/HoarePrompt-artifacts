The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **n is at least 3, i is 3, g is 0, v1 is n-1 if the user input string r is '<' for all iterations, otherwise v1 is the last value of v2 for which the user input string r is '<', kp is 0, v2 is n-1, I is a function that takes no arguments and returns a list of integers from stdin, R is a function that takes no arguments and returns an integer from stdin, stdin contains 0 inputs if the user input string r is '>', otherwise stdin is empty, r is a string entered by the user for this iteration, and prev is 2 if the user input string r is '<' or '>', otherwise prev is 0 if the user input string r is '='**
