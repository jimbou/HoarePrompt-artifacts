The code prints a formatted string containing a question mark, the value of `v1`, the current value of `i` (which is incremented by 1), the value of `v1` again, and the updated value of `prev` based on the user input string `r`.

Output: **? [v1] [i+1] [v1] [prev] (where v1 is the value of v1, i+1 is the incremented value of i, and prev is the updated value of prev based on the user input string r)**
