Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `kp` is 1, `v2` is `n-1`, `I` is a function that takes no arguments and returns a list of integers from stdin, `R` is a function that takes no arguments and returns an integer from stdin, stdin contains 0 inputs, `r` is the user input string, `prev` is 0, the output buffer contains "! [0] [n-1]" where 0 is the value of `prev` and `n-1` is the value of `v1`, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: "? 0 0 1 1", and this is printed: "? 1 1 2 2", and this is printed: "? 2 2 3 3", and so on, until this is printed: "? (n-2) (n-2) (n-1) (n-1)"
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
    sys.stdout.flush()
    r = input()
    if r == '>':
        prev = i
    elif r == '=':
        print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
        sys.stdout.flush()
        r2 = input('')
        if r2 == '<':
            prev = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The program's state is updated based on the user input string `r`. If `r` is '>', the program updates `prev` to 1 and prints a series of strings in the format "? [i] [i] [i+1] [i+1]" until `i` reaches `n-1`, and then prints "? [n-1] [1] [n-1] [0]". If `r` is '=', `prev` is updated to 1 if the next input `r2` is '<', otherwise `prev` remains 0. In all cases, the output buffer contains "! [prev] [n-1]" where `prev` is the updated value and `n-1` is the value of `v1`, and the output buffer is flushed. If `r` is neither '>' nor '=', the program's state remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *prev is updated according to the user input string r, i is incremented by 1, n remains unchanged, the string "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" is printed to the console, r is the user's input, and the console is flushed. If r equals '>', then prev is equal to i. If r equals '=', then the string "? [i] [i] [prev] [prev]" is printed to the console, r2 is the user's input. If r2 equals '<', then prev is updated to the current value of i. If r does not equal '=' or '>', then no additional actions are performed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: prev, i, n are updated according to the user input string r. If r is '>', then prev is the old value of i plus 1, i is the old value of i plus 1, n remains unchanged. If r is '=', then prev, i, n are updated according to the user input string r2. If r2 is '<', then prev is set to the old value of i plus 1, i is set to the old value of i plus 1, n remains unchanged. If r2 is not '<', then prev is updated according to the user input string r2, i is the old value of i plus 1, n remains unchanged. If r is not '=' or '>', no updates are made. In all cases, a message is printed: "? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]" , where prev is the updated value according to the user input string r, i is the old value of i plus 1, and v1 is the value of v1, sys.stdout is flushed, and r is the user input string.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
