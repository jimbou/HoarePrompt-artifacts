Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `i` is 1, `kp` is 1, `v2` is 1, `I` is a function that takes no arguments and returns a list of integers from stdin, `R` is a function that takes no arguments and returns an integer from stdin, stdin contains 0 inputs, `r` is the user input string, and `prev` is 0 if the user input string `r` is '=', otherwise `prev` is `n-1` if the user input string `r` is '<', otherwise `prev` is `n-2` if the user input string `r` is '>', and the output buffer contains "! [prev] [v1]" where `prev` is the value of `prev` and `v1` is the value of `v1`, and the output buffer is flushed.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `v2` has been updated to be equal to the value of `i`, which is 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
