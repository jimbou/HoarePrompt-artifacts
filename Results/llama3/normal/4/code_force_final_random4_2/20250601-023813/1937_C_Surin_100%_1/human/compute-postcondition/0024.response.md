Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 3, i is 3, g is 0, I is a function that takes no arguments and returns a list of integers from stdin, R is a function that takes no arguments and returns an integer from stdin, stdin is empty, the string "? 0 0 1 1" has been printed, r is a string entered by the user, the string "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" has been printed where v2 is 3, and v1 is 2 if the user input string r is '<', otherwise v1 is 0, kp is 0, v2 is 3, and this is printed: "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" where v2 is 3, and v1 is 2 if the user input string r is '<', otherwise v1 is 0, r is a new string entered by the user. If the new string r is '<', then v1 is 3. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
