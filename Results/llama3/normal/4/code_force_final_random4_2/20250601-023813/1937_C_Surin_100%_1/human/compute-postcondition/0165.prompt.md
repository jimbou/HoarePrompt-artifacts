Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The output buffer is flushed, the loop finishes executing when `i` reaches `n`, at which point `prev` is updated to `n-1` if the user input string `r` is '>', otherwise it remains unchanged, and the output buffer contains "! [prev] [n-1]" where `prev` is the updated value and `n-1` is the value of `v1`, `kp` is increased by 1 and the value returned by `int(input())` must be greater than `kp`, `n` is an integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    v2 = i
    print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
    sys.stdout.flush()
    r = input('')
    if r == '<':
        v1 = v2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The output buffer is flushed, the loop finishes executing when `i` reaches `n`, at which point `prev` is updated to `n-1` if the user input string `r` is '>', otherwise it remains unchanged, and the output buffer contains "! [prev] [n-1]" where `prev` is the updated value and `n-1` is the value of `v1`, `kp` is increased by 1 and the value returned by `int(input())` must be greater than `kp`, `n` is an integer and is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 1, `i` is 1, `v2` is 1, and this is printed: "? 0 0 1 1", `r` is a user input string. If the current value of `r` is '<', then the value of `v1` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The output buffer is flushed, the loop finishes executing when `i` reaches `n`, at which point `prev` is updated to `n-1` if the user input string `r` is '>', otherwise it remains unchanged, and the output buffer contains "! [prev] [n-1]" where `prev` is the updated value and `n-1` is the value of `v1`, `kp` is increased by 1 and the value returned by `int(input())` must be greater than `kp`, `n` is an integer and is greater than 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is 1 if `r` is '<', otherwise it is 2, `i` is 2, `v2` is 2, and this is printed: "? 0 0 1 1", `r` is a user input string. If the current value of `r` is '<', then the value of `v1` is 2, and this is printed: "? 1 1 2 2", and `r` is assigned the value of the user input string.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The output buffer is flushed, the loop finishes executing when `i` reaches `n`, at which point `prev` is updated to `n-1` if the user input string `r` is '>', otherwise it remains unchanged, and the output buffer contains "! [prev] [n-1]" where `prev` is the updated value and `n-1` is the value of `v1`, `kp` is increased by 1 and the value returned by `int(input())` must be greater than `kp`, `n` is an integer and is greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is 1 if `r` is '<', otherwise it is 2, `i` is 3, `v2` is 3, and this is printed: "? 0 0 1 1", `r` is a user input string. If the current value of `r` is '<', then the value of `v1` is 3, and this is printed: "? 1 1 2 2", and `r` is assigned the value of the user input string. and this is printed: "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" where v1 is 3 and v2 is 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
