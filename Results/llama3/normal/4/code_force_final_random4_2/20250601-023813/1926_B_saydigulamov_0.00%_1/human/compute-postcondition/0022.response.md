Output State: **`a` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `k` is an empty list, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `a` remains unchanged as it was initially an integer greater than or equal to 2. The value of `i` also remains unchanged as it was initially 1. However, the value of `k` has changed to an empty list as the code `k = []` assigns an empty list to `k`. The stdin remains empty as there was no input operation performed.
