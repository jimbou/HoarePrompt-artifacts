Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 10) followed by n strings of length n consisting of characters '0' and '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1' s in the grid. The size of the triangle or square is greater than 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(a):
    k = []
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        b = input()
        if '1' in b:
            k.append(b.count('1'))
    if k[0] == k[1]:
        print(k)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `k` is a list containing one or more integers, stdin is empty. If the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`, then the list `k` is printed. Otherwise, no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `k` is a list containing a number of integers equal to the number of strings input that contain '1', each integer is the count of '1' in the corresponding string. If the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`, then the list `k` is printed. Otherwise, no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 2, `b` is a string greater than 1. If the current value of `b` contains the digit 1, `k` is a list containing the count of digit 1 in the current value of `b` repeated `a` times. If the current value of `b` does not contain the digit 1, `k` is a list containing 0 repeated `a` times. If the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`, the list `k` is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
