Output State: **`a` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `b` is a string containing '0' and '1' characters, stdin contains a grid of strings with '0' and '1' characters, representing a triangle or square of '1' s. If `b` contains the character '1', `k` is a list containing one integer which is 1. Otherwise, `k` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to a string containing '0' and '1' characters, which is the input from the stdin. The other variables `a` and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin now contains a grid of strings with '0' and '1' characters, representing a triangle or square of '1' s. The value of `k` depends on the value of `b`, if `b` contains the character '1', `k` is a list containing one integer which is 1, otherwise, `k` is an empty list.
