Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 10) followed by n strings of length n consisting of characters '0' and '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1' s in the grid. The size of the triangle or square is greater than 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The variable `a` is assigned the value of the first input integer, which is between 1 and 100 (inclusive). The remaining input in the stdin is reduced by one test case, but the structure of the remaining test cases remains the same, each consisting of an integer n followed by n strings of length n consisting of characters '0' and '1', with the grid containing exactly one triangle or square of size greater than 1 that contains all the '1's.
