Output State: **`a` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `b` is a string containing '0' and '1' characters, `k` is a list containing one integer which is the count of '1' characters in `b` plus 1 if `b` contains the character '1', otherwise `k` is a list containing one integer which is the count of '1' characters in `b`, stdin contains a grid of strings with '0' and '1' characters, representing a triangle or square of '1' s, `int(input())` is greater than 1**

The value of `b` is updated to be the first string from the input, which is a grid of strings with '0' and '1' characters. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin now contains the remaining grid of strings.
