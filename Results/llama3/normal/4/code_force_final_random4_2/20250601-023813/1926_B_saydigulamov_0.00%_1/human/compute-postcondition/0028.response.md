The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and the input, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and the input. If `_` is less than the input, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0 and the input has one less input than before. So for the loop to be executed one more time the `_` is 1 and the input has one less input than before the last iteration.
State: **`a` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `b` is a string greater than 0. If `b` contains the character '1', then `k` is a list containing one integer greater than 0. Otherwise, `k` is an empty list. `_` is 1 and stdin contains one less input than before the last iteration.**
