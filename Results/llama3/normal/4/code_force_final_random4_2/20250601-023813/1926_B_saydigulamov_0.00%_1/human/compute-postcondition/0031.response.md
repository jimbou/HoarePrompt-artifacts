Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `b` is a string greater than 0, `_` is 1. If `b` contains the character '1', then `k` is a list containing two integers: one integer greater than 0 and the count of '1' in `b`. Otherwise, `k` is a list containing one integer: 0.***
