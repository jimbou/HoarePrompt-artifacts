Functionality: **The function reads an integer t from standard input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer n, followed by n strings of length n, and counts the occurrences of '1' in each string. If the count of '1's in the first two strings is equal, it prints the list of counts. The function repeats this process for all test cases, but only prints the list of counts for the last test case if the first two counts are equal.**
