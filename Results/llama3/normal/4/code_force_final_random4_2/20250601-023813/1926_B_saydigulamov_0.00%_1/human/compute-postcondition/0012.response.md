The only variable in the loop head is variable `_`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `int(input())`. If `int(input())` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `int(input())` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `int(input())` must be greater than 1.
State: **`a` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `b` is a string containing '0' and '1' characters, `k` is a list containing one integer which is the count of '1' characters in `b` plus 1 if `b` contains the character '1', otherwise `k` is a list containing one integer which is the count of '1' characters in `b`, stdin contains a grid of strings with '0' and '1' characters, representing a triangle or square of '1' s, `int(input())` is greater than 1**
