Reasoning: 

The given program is incorrect. The program checks if the first two elements of the list `k` are equal, and if they are, it prints the list `k`. However, this does not correctly determine whether the shape is a square or a triangle.

A square has the same number of '1's in each row, so the list `k` should have the same element repeated. On the other hand, a triangle has a different number of '1's in each row, with the number of '1's increasing or decreasing by 2 in each row.

The program does not correctly check for these conditions. It only checks if the first two elements of the list `k` are equal, which is not sufficient to determine the shape.

Moreover, the program does not print "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" as required by the problem statement. Instead, it prints the list `k` when the first two elements are equal.

Correctness: **False**
