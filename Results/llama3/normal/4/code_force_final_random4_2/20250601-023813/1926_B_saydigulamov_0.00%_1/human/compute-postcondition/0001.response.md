According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. If `a` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), which ensures that the loop will execute. However, to make the state more precise, we can adjust `a` to be at least 1. Additionally, since `i` is the loop variable, we can initialize it to 0, which is the starting value of the range.

State: **`a` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 10) followed by n strings of length n consisting of characters '0' and '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1' s in the grid. The size of the triangle or square is greater than 1.**
