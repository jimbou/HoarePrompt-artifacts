The only variables in the loop head are variables  `_` and `input()`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input. If the input is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `a` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `k` is an empty list, stdin is empty does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `input()` is greater than 0 and `_` is now 0. 
State: **`a` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `k` is an empty list, stdin is not empty, `_` is 0, `input()` must be greater than 0**
