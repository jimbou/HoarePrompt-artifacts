Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 2, `b` is a string greater than 1. If the current value of `b` contains the digit 1, `k` is a list containing the count of digit 1 in the current value of `b` twice. If the current value of `b` does not contain the digit 1, `k` is a list containing 0.***
