#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 100) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 10) followed by n strings of length n consisting of characters '0' and '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1' s in the grid. The size of the triangle or square is greater than 1.
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))
        
        if k[0] == k[1]:
            print(k)
        
    #State: `a` is an integer greater than or equal to the number of test cases, `i` is `a-1`, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in each string of the last test case that contains '1', repeated `a` times. If the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`, the list `k` is printed. Otherwise, no action is taken.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer t from standard input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer n, followed by n strings of length n, and counts the occurrences of '1' in each string. If the count of '1's in the first two strings is equal, it prints the list of counts. The function repeats this process for all test cases, but only prints the list of counts for the last test case if the first two counts are equal.
