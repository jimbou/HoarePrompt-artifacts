Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by reading the input grid and counting the number of '1's in each row. However, the program is incomplete and does not correctly determine whether the shape is a square or a triangle.

The program checks if the number of '1's in the first two rows is equal, and if so, prints the counts. However, this is not a sufficient condition to determine whether the shape is a square or a triangle. A square can have different numbers of '1's in each row, and a triangle can have the same number of '1's in the first two rows.

Furthermore, the program does not check the positions of the '1's in the grid, which is crucial in determining the shape. A square has '1's at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid, while a triangle has '1's in a specific pattern.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
