Output State: **`a` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `k` is an empty list, `b` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive), stdin contains a grid of strings with '0' and '1' characters, representing a triangle or square of '1' s.**

In this output state, the value of `b` is assigned the integer input from stdin, which represents the size of the grid (n). The grid itself is still in stdin, waiting to be processed. The values of `a`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged. The precondition that the grid contains exactly one triangle or square of '1' s, with a size greater than 1, is still valid.
