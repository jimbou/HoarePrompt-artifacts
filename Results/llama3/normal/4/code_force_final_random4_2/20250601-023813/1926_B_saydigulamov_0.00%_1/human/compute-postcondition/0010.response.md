Output State: **`a` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `b` is a string containing '0' and '1' characters, `k` is a list containing one integer which is the count of '1' characters in `b` plus 1 if `b` contains the character '1', otherwise `k` is a list containing one integer which is the count of '1' characters in `b`, stdin contains a grid of strings with '0' and '1' characters, representing a triangle or square of '1' s.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `a` remains the same, `i` is still 0, `b` is still a string containing '0' and '1' characters. The list `k` now contains one integer which is the count of '1' characters in `b` plus 1 if `b` contains the character '1', otherwise `k` is a list containing one integer which is the count of '1' characters in `b`. The stdin still contains a grid of strings with '0' and '1' characters, representing a triangle or square of '1' s.
