The code `k.append(b.count('1'))` appends the count of the character '1' in the string `b` to the list `k`. 

If `b` contains the character '1', then `k` is a list containing one integer greater than 0. In this case, the count of '1' in `b` is greater than 0, so `k` will contain two integers: the original integer greater than 0 and the count of '1' in `b`.

If `b` does not contain the character '1', then `k` is an empty list. In this case, the count of '1' in `b` is 0, so `k` will contain one integer: 0.

The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`a` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `b` is a string greater than 0, `_` is 1, if `b` contains the character '1', then `k` is a list containing two integers: one integer greater than 0 and the count of '1' in `b`, otherwise, `k` is a list containing one integer: 0.**
