Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `b` is a string containing '0' and '1' characters, `k` is a list containing one or two integers, stdin contains a grid of strings with '0' and '1' characters, representing a triangle or square of '1' s, `int(input())` is greater than 1. If `b` contains the character '1', then `k` contains two integers: the first integer is the count of '1' characters in `b` plus 1, and the second integer is the count of '1' characters in `b`. If `b` does not contain the character '1', then `k` contains one integer which is the count of '1' characters in `b`.***
