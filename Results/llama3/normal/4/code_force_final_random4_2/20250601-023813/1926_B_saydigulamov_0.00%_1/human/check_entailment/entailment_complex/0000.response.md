Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The program is supposed to determine whether a given binary square grid contains a triangle or a square, but it does not correctly implement this logic.

The program checks if the count of '1's in the first two strings is equal, and if so, it prints the list of counts. However, this is not a correct way to determine whether the grid contains a triangle or a square.

A correct implementation would involve checking the pattern of '1's in the grid to determine whether it matches the pattern of a triangle or a square. The program does not do this, and therefore it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
