The code `k.append(b.count('1'))` appends the count of digit 1 in the current value of `b` to the list `k`. 

If the current value of `b` contains the digit 1, `k` is a list containing the count of digit 1 in the current value of `b`. The code appends the count of digit 1 in the current value of `b` to `k`, so the new value of `k` is a list containing the count of digit 1 in the current value of `b` twice. 

If the current value of `b` does not contain the digit 1, `k` is an empty list. The code appends the count of digit 1 in the current value of `b` to `k`, so the new value of `k` is a list containing 0.

The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`a` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 2, `b` is a string greater than 1, if the current value of `b` contains the digit 1, `k` is a list containing the count of digit 1 in the current value of `b` twice. Otherwise, `k` is a list containing 0.**
