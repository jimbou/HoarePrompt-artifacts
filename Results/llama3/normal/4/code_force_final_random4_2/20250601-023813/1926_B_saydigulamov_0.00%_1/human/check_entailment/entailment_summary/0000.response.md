Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The program only checks if the count of '1's in the first two strings is equal, and if so, it prints the list of counts. However, this is not sufficient to determine whether the shape is a square or a triangle.

A square is defined as a shape consisting of k consecutive rows, where the i-th row has k consecutive characters '1', which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid. The program does not check for this condition.

A triangle is defined as a shape consisting of k consecutive rows, where the i-th row has 2*i-1 consecutive characters '1', and the central 1s are located in one column. The program does not check for this condition either.

The program's logic is incomplete and does not accurately determine the type of shape based on the given grid.

Correctness: **False**
