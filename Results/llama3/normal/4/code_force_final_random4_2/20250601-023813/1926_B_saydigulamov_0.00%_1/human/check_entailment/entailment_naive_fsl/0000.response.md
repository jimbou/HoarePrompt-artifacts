Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine whether the shape in the grid is a square or a triangle. It only checks if the number of '1's in the first two rows are equal, which is not sufficient to determine the shape. 

For example, if the input is:

4
0000
0000
0100
1110

The program will print [1, 1] and stop, but it should print "TRIANGLE" because the shape in the grid is a triangle.

A correct program should check the number of '1's in each row and their positions to determine whether the shape is a square or a triangle.
