Output State: **`a` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `k` is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 10) followed by n strings of length n consisting of characters '0' and '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1' s in the grid. The size of the triangle or square is greater than 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `a` remains an integer greater than or equal to 1, the value of `i` remains 0, and a new empty list `k` is created. The input state remains the same, with t-1 test cases left to process, each test case consisting of an integer n followed by n strings of length n containing characters '0' and '1', with the grid containing exactly one triangle or square of size greater than 1 that contains all the '1's.
