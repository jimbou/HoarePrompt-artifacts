Output State: **`a` is an integer greater than or equal to the number of test cases, `i` is `a-1`, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in each string of the last test case that contains '1', repeated `a` times. If the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`, the list `k` is printed. Otherwise, no action is taken.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `a` will be greater than or equal to the number of test cases, `i` will be one less than `a`, and `k` will contain the count of '1' in each string of the last test case that contains '1', repeated `a` times. If the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`, the list `k` will be printed. Otherwise, no action will be taken.
