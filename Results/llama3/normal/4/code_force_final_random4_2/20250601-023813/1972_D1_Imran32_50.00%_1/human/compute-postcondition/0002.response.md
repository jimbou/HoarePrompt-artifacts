Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, ans is equal to n plus (n + 2) divided by 4 rounded down, root is an integer equal to the square root of n rounded up to the nearest integer and is greater than or equal to 2, stdin contains one less test case, i is 2**

The code snippet first calculates the value of `cnt` as the square of `i`, which is 4. Then, it increments `ans` by the integer division of `n + i` by `cnt`, which is equivalent to `(n + 2) // 4`. The value of `ans` becomes `n + (n + 2) // 4`. No other variables are affected by the code.
