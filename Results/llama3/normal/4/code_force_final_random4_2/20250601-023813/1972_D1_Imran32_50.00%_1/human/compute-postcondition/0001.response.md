The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and root, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `root`. If root is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, ans is equal to n, root is an integer equal to the square root of n rounded up to the nearest integer, stdin contains one less test case does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `root` is greater than or equal to 2 and i is now 2. 
State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, ans is equal to n, root is an integer equal to the square root of n rounded up to the nearest integer and is greater than or equal to 2, stdin contains one less test case, i is 2**
