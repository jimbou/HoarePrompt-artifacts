Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem. The problem asks to calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions:

* 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m;
* a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).

However, the program does not correctly implement this logic. The function `func_1()` does not take into account the value of `m` and does not calculate the gcd of `a` and `b`. It also does not check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

For example, if `n = 3` and `m = 5`, the program will output `4`, but the correct output should be `4` because the pairs `(1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 3)` satisfy the conditions.

The program seems to be trying to solve a different problem, and it does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
