Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, ans is equal to n plus the sum of (n + i) divided by i squared rounded down for i from 2 to the square root of n rounded up to the nearest integer, root is an integer equal to the square root of n rounded up to the nearest integer, stdin contains one less test case, i is equal to the square root of n rounded up to the nearest integer plus 1.**

This output state means that after the loop has finished executing, the value of 'ans' will be the sum of 'n' and the sum of the integer divisions of 'n + i' by 'i' squared, where 'i' ranges from 2 to the square root of 'n' rounded up to the nearest integer. The value of 'i' will be one more than the square root of 'n' rounded up to the nearest integer, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The values of 'n', 'k', and 'root' remain unchanged, and 'stdin' still contains one less test case.
