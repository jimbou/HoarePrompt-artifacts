Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, ans is equal to n, root is an integer equal to the square root of n rounded up to the nearest integer, stdin contains one less test case.**

The first line reads two positive integers n and k from the input and assigns them to the variables n and k, respectively. The second line assigns the value of n to the variable ans. The third line calculates the square root of n, rounds it up to the nearest integer using the math.sqrt function and the int function, and assigns the result to the variable root. 

Note that the value of stdin is reduced by one test case after the execution of the code.
