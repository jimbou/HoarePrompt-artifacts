The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and root, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `root`. If `i` is less than `root + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `root` is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and `root` must be greater than or equal to 3.
State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, ans is equal to n plus (n + 2) divided by 4 rounded down, root is an integer equal to the square root of n rounded up to the nearest integer and is greater than or equal to 3, stdin contains one less test case, i is 3**
