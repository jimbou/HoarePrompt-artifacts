Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, ans is equal to n plus (n + 2) divided by 4 rounded down, plus (n + 3) divided by 9 rounded down, root is an integer equal to the square root of n rounded up to the nearest integer and is greater than or equal to 3, stdin contains one less test case, i is 3**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line calculates the value of `cnt` as the square of `i`, which is 3, so `cnt` becomes 9. The second line increments `ans` by the value of `(n + i)` divided by `cnt` rounded down. Since `i` is 3 and `cnt` is 9, this is equivalent to adding `(n + 3)` divided by 9 rounded down to `ans`. The initial value of `ans` was `n` plus `(n + 2)` divided by 4 rounded down. The new value of `ans` is the sum of these two values. No other variables are affected by the code.
