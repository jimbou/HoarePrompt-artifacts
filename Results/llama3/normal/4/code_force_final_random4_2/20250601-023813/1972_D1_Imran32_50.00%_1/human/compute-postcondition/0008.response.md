The code prints the value of `ans`, which is calculated based on the values of `n` and `k`. `ans` is equal to `n` plus the sum of `(n + i)` divided by `i` squared rounded down for `i` from 2 to the square root of `n` rounded up to the nearest integer.

Since `n` is a positive integer and `k` is a positive integer, the value of `ans` will be a positive integer as well. However, without knowing the exact values of `n` and `k`, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`.

The value of `root` is the square root of `n` rounded up to the nearest integer, and `i` is equal to `root` plus 1. However, these values are not directly printed in the given code snippet.

Therefore, the print statement will output the calculated value of `ans`, which is a positive integer.

Output: **ans (where ans is a positive integer equal to n plus the sum of (n + i) divided by i squared rounded down for i from 2 to the square root of n rounded up to the nearest integer)**
