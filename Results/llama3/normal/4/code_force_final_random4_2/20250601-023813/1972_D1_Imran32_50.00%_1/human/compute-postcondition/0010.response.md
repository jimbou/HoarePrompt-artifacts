Functionality: **This function reads a test case from standard input, where the test case consists of two positive integers n and k. It calculates a value 'ans' by adding to n the sum of the integer divisions of (n + i) by i squared, where i ranges from 2 to the square root of n rounded up to the nearest integer. The function then prints the calculated 'ans' value. The function does not modify the input variables n and k, and it does not perform any actions other than reading input and printing output. The function's purpose is to compute and display a specific mathematical expression based on the input values n and k.**
