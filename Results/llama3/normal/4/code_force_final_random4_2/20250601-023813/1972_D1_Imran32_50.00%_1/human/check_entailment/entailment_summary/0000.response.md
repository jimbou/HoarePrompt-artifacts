Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The problem statement requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions:

* 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m
* a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b)

However, the program does not take into account the value of m, which is the second input integer. The program only uses the value of n to calculate the result.

The program's logic is also incorrect. It calculates the sum of the integer divisions of (n + i) by i squared, where i ranges from 2 to the square root of n. This logic does not relate to the problem statement's conditions.

The correct solution would involve iterating over all possible values of a and b, checking if the conditions are satisfied, and counting the number of valid pairs.

Correctness: **False**
