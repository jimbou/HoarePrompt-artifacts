Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `x` is 0, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a` plus the integer at index `i` in `a` minus twice the integer at index `i+x` in `a` plus the integer at index `i` in `a` minus twice the integer at index `i+x` in `a`, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `ans1` has been updated by subtracting twice the integer at index `i+x` in `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `i` plus `x` is less than `n` is still valid, so the update to `ans1` is applied.
