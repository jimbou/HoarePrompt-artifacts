Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `x` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the first integer in `a` minus four times the integer at index `i` in `a`, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four, `i` is 2, and the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2` is being printed.**

In this output state, the value of `ans1` has been updated to be the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the first integer in `a` minus four times the integer at index `i` in `a`, which is two times the previous value of `ans1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
