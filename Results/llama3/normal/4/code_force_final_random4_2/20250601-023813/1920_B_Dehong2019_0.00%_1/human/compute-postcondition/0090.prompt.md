Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains three integers n, k, and x. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
    a = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())), reverse=True)
    ans1 = sum(a)
    for i in range(x):
        ans1 -= a[i] * 2
    ans2 = ans1
    for i in range(k):
        ans1 += a[i]
        if i + x < n:
            ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2
        ans = max(ans1, ans2)
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `x` is 0, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a` plus the sum of the integers at indices `i` in `a` for `i` in range `k` minus twice the sum of the integers at indices `i+x` in `a` for `i` in range `k` where `i+x` is less than `n`, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is `k-1`, and the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `x` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a` plus the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `k-1`, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2` after `ans1` has been updated by subtracting 2 times `a[i+x]` if `i + x` is less than `n`, `i` is `k-1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four, and the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2` after `ans1` has been updated by subtracting 2 times `a[i+x]` if `i + x` is less than `n` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `x` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a` plus the sum of the first `k` integers in `a`, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `i` is `k-1`, and the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
