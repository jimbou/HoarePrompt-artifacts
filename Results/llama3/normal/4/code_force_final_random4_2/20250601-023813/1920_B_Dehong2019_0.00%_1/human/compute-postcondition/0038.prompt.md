Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 0 and decremented by 1, _ is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, ans1 is the sum of the integers in a, ans2 is the sum of the integers in a minus twice the sum of the x largest integers in a, ans is the maximum of ans1 and ans2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four, i is k-1, and the maximum of ans1 and ans2 is being printed
Code of the loop:
for i in range(x):
    ans1 -= a[i] * 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `x` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the first integer in `a`, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four, `i` is 0, and the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2` is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `x` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the first integer in `a` minus twice the integer at index `i` in `a`, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four, `i` is 1, and the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2` is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `x` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the first integer in `a` minus four times the integer at index `i` in `a`, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four, `i` is 2, and the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2` is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
