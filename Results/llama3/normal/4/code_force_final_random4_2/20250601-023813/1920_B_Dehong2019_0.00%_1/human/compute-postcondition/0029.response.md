Output: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `x` is 0, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a` plus the sum of the integers at indices `i` in `a` for `i` in range `k` minus twice the sum of the integers at indices `i+x` in `a` for `i` in range `k` where `i+x` is less than `n`, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is `k-1`, and the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2` is being printed**
