Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `x` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the first integer in `a`, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four, `i` is 0, and the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2` is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans1` has been updated by subtracting twice the first integer in the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` is still in descending order, and `ans2` is still the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`. The maximum of `ans1` and `ans2` is still being printed.
