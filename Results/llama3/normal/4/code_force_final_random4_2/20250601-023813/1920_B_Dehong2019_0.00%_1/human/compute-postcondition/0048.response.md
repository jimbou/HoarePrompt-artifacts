Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `x` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a` plus `a[0]` plus `a[1]` minus 2 times `a[i+x]`, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans1` has been updated by subtracting twice the value of `a[i+x]` from its previous value. The values of the other variables remain the same. The list `a` is still in descending order, and `ans2` and `ans` are still calculated based on the sum of the integers in `a` and the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`. The input stream `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus four.
