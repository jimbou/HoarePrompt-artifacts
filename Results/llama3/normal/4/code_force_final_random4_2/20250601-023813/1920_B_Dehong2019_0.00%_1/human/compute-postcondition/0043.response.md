Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1, `x` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a` plus `a[0]` minus 2 times the value of `a` at index `i+x`, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four, `i` is 0 and the current value of `i` plus `x` is less than `n`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans1` has been updated by subtracting twice the value of `a` at index `i+x`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans1` is now the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a` plus `a[0]` minus 2 times the value of `a` at index `i+x`. The rest of the variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
