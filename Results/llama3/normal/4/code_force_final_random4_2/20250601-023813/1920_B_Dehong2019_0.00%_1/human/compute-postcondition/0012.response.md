Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `x` is 0, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a` plus the integer at index `i` in `a`, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `ans1` has been updated by adding the integer at index `i` in list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
