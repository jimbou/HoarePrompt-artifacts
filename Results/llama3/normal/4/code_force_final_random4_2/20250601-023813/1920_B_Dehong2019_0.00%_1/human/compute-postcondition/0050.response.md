Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `x` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a` plus `a[0]` plus `a[1]`, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2` after `ans1` has been updated by subtracting 2 times `a[i+x]` if `i + x` is less than `n`, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2` after `ans1` has been updated by subtracting 2 times `a[i+x]` if `i + x` is less than `n`.
