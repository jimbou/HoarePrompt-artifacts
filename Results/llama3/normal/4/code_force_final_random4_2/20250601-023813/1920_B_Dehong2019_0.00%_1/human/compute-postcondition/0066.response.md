To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `x`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `x` is an integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `x` remains the same, but since `i` is now 2, `x` must be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `x` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus four times the integer at index `i` in `a`, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `i` is 2**
