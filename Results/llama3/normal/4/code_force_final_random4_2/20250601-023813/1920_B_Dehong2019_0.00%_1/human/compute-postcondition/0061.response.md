Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 2, n is an integer, k is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, x is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of integers in descending order, ans1 is the sum of the integers in a, ans2 is the sum of the integers in a minus twice the sum of the x largest integers in a, ans is the maximum of ans1 and ans2, i is k-1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

The first line assigns the integer values of the input to `n`, `k`, and `x`. The second line assigns a sorted list of integers from stdin to `a` in descending order. Stdin now contains multiple test cases minus two. The third line assigns the sum of the integers in `a` to `ans1`. The values of `ans2` and `ans` are not affected by the code. The value of `i` is `k-1`.
