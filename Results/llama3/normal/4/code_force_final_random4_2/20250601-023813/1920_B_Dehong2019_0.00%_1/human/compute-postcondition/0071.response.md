Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `x` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a` plus `a[0]`, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `i` is 0**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` is still a positive integer, `_` is still 2, `n` is still an integer, `k` is still a positive integer, `x` is still a non-negative integer, `a` is still a list of integers in descending order, `ans1` has increased by the value of the first element in `a`, `ans2` remains the same, `ans` is still the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, and `i` is still 0.
