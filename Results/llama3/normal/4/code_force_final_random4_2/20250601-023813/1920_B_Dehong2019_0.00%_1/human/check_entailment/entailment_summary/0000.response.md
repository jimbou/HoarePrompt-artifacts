Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem described, where Alice and Bob play a game with an array of integers. The program correctly implements the strategy for both players to play optimally.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program reads the input correctly, parsing the number of test cases, the number of elements in the array, the limit on the number of elements Alice can remove, and the limit on the number of elements Bob can multiply by -1.
2.  It sorts the array in descending order, which is necessary to determine the optimal strategy for both players.
3.  The program calculates the maximum sum that can be obtained by subtracting twice the sum of the x largest elements (which Bob will multiply by -1) and then adding the sum of the first k elements (which Alice will remove).
4.  The program correctly updates the maximum sum by considering the optimal strategy for Alice, where she removes the k largest elements that will result in the maximum sum after Bob's move.
5.  The program prints the maximum sum for each test case, which represents the sum of elements in the array after both players play optimally.

Correctness: **True**
