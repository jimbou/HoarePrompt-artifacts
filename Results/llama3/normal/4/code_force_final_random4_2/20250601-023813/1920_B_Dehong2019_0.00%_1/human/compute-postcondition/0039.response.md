Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `x` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four, `i` is `x-1`, and the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2` is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only change being that `ans2` is now equal to `ans1`. This means that both `ans1` and `ans2` now hold the same value, which is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
