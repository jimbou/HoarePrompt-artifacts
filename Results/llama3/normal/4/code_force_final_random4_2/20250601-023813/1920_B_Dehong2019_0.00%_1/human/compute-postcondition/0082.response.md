Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 2, `x` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a` plus `a[0]` plus `a[1]` plus `a[2]`, `ans2` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a`, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2` after updating `ans1` by subtracting twice `a[i + x]` if `i` plus `x` is less than `n`, `i` is 2. If `i` plus `x` is less than `n`, `ans1` is updated by subtracting twice `a[i + x]`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `ans1` has been updated by adding the value of `a[i]`, where `i` is 2. The value of `ans1` is now the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the `x` largest integers in `a` plus `a[0]` plus `a[1]` plus `a[2]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
