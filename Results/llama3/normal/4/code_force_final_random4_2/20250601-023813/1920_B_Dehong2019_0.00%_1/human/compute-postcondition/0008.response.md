Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `x` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the largest integer in `a` minus twice the second largest integer in `a` minus twice the third largest integer in `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `ans1` has been updated to subtract twice the third largest integer in `a`, since `i` is 2 and `a` is in descending order. The other variables remain unchanged.
