This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: the number of elements (n), the number of elements to consider (k), and the number of largest elements to subtract twice (x). The second line contains n integers. The function calculates the maximum sum that can be obtained by subtracting twice the sum of the x largest elements and then adding the sum of the first k elements. It prints the maximum sum for each test case.
