To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `n` is already a positive integer, we can conclude that `n` must be greater than 0.

The variable `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop, so we can adjust its state to `i` is 0.

The other variables `k`, `arr`, and `pos` are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `arr` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, `pos` is -1, `i` is 0**
