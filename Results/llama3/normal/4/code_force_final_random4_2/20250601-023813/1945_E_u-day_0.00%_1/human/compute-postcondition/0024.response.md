Postcondition: ***n is greater than 2, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, i is n-1, pos is either n-1 or -1 depending on whether arr[n-1] is equal to k or not. If arr[mid] > k, then high is updated to mid which is (low + high) // 2. Otherwise, low is updated to (low + high) // 2. In both cases, mid remains (low + high) // 2, and st is a set containing the value (low + high) // 2 and mid.***
