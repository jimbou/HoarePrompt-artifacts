To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `low` and `high` since they are the variables in the loop head.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `low + 1 < high`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n-1`, `pos` is either `n-1` or `-1`, and `st` contains the value `(low + high) // 2` and `mid`.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust `low` and `high` such that `low + 1 < high`. Since `i` is `n-1`, we can infer that `high` is at least `n`. Therefore, we can adjust `low` to be less than `n-1` to satisfy the condition.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `arr` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, `i` is n-1, `pos` is either n-1 or -1 depending on whether arr[n-1] is equal to k or not, `low` is less than n-1, `high` is at least n, and `st` is a set containing the value (low + high) // 2 and mid**
