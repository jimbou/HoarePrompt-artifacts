The code assigns the value of `i` to `pos`. Since `i` is 0 and `arr[i]` is equal to `k`, `pos` is now 0. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `arr` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, `pos` is 0, `i` is 0, and the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to `k`.**
