The value of `pos` is updated to the value of `i`, which is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `arr` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, `i` is 2, and `pos` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `arr` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, `i` is 2, and `pos` is 2**
