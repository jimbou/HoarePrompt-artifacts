To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `low + 1 < high`. This condition must be true for the loop to execute at least once.

Given the initial states:
- `n` is a positive integer
- `k` is a positive integer such that `1 <= k <= n`
- `arr` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order
- `i` is `n-1`
- `low` is 0
- `high` is `n-1`
- `st` is an empty set
- `pos` is either `n-1` or `-1` depending on whether `arr[n-1]` is equal to `k` or not

The only variables in the loop head are `low` and `high`. The condition `low + 1 < high` needs to be satisfied for the loop to execute. Given that `low` is 0 and `high` is `n-1`, the condition simplifies to `1 < n-1`, which further simplifies to `2 < n`.

Since `n` is already stated to be a positive integer, and given the condition derived, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `n` is greater than 2. This is because if `n` were 1 or 2, the loop condition would not be satisfied, and the loop would not execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state to ensure the loop can execute at least once is:

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `k` is a positive integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, `arr` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `i` is `n-1`, `low` is 0, `high` is `n-1`, `st` is an empty set, `pos` is either `n-1` or `-1` depending on whether `arr[n-1]` is equal to `k` or not**
