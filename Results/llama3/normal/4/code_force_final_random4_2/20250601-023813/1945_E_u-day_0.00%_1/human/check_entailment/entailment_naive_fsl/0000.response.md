Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the binary search algorithm as described in the problem description. The problem description states that the algorithm should end when `r - l = 1`, but the program does not check for this condition. Instead, it continues to loop until `low + 1 < high`, which is not the same condition.

Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the case when `arr[mid] == k`. In this case, the program should set `low = mid` and continue the loop, but instead it sets `low = mid` and breaks out of the loop.

A counterexample to the program's correctness is the input `n = 5, k = 3, arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. The program will output `0`, but the correct output should be `1` followed by the swap operation `3 4`.
