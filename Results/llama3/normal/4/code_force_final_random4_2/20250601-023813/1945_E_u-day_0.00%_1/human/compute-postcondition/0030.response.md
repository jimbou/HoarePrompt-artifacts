Output State: **low is equal to high, st is a set containing all the values of mid from the previous iterations.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of low is equal to the value of high, and the set st contains all the values of mid from the previous iterations. This means that the loop has converged to a single value, and the set st contains all the mid values that were calculated during the iterations. The other variables in the precondition, such as n, k, arr, i, and pos, remain unchanged.
