Postcondition: ***n is greater than 2, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, i is n-1, pos is either n-1 or -1 depending on whether arr[n-1] is equal to k or not. If arr[mid] is greater than k, then low is less than n-1, high is (low + high) // 2, st is a set containing the value (low + high) // 2 and mid, mid is (low + high) // 2. Otherwise, low is (n-1 + high) // 2, high is at least n, st is a set containing the value (n-1 + high) // 2 and mid, mid is (n-1 + high) // 2.***
