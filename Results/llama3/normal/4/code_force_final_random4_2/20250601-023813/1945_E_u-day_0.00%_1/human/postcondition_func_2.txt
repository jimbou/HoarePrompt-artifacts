This function searches for a target value `k` in a list of distinct integers `arr` and prints the result. If `k` is found at the index `low`, it prints 0. If `k` is not found at `low`, it prints 1, followed by the index `low + 1` and the actual position of `k` in the list (`pos + 1`). The function modifies the state of the program by printing the search result and the indices, but does not modify the input list `arr` or the values of `n`, `k`, or `pos`.
