Postcondition: ***n is greater than 2, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, i is n-1, low is 0, high is n-1, st is a set containing the value (low + high) // 2, pos is either n-1 or -1 depending on whether arr[n-1] is equal to k or not, mid is (low + high) // 2, and arr[mid] is less than or equal to k***
