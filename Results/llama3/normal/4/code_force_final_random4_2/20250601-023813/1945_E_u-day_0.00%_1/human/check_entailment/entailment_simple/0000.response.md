Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the binary search algorithm to find the target number `k` in the permutation `arr`. If `k` is found at the correct position `low` after the binary search, it prints 0, indicating that no swaps are needed. If `k` is not found at the correct position, it prints 1, indicating that one swap is needed, and then prints the indices of the swap operation, which is to swap the element at position `low + 1` with the element at position `pos + 1`, where `pos` is the actual position of `k` in the permutation.

The program correctly handles the case where `k` is not found at the correct position after the binary search, and it correctly identifies the swap operation needed to move `k` to the correct position.

Correctness: **True**
