Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, i is n-1, low is 0, high is n-1, st is an empty set, pos is either n-1 or -1 depending on whether arr[n-1] is equal to k or not.**

The code initializes two new variables, `low` and `high`, and assigns them the values 0 and `n-1`, respectively. It also creates an empty set `st`. The values of `n`, `k`, `arr`, `i`, and `pos` remain unchanged.
