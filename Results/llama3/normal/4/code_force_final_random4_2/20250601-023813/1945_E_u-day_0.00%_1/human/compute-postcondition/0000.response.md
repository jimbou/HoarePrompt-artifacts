Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, pos is -1**

The code snippet consists of three lines. The first line calls a function `func_1()` and assigns its return values to `n` and `k`. Since `n` and `k` are already defined as positive integers in the initial state, their values are updated to the returned values. The second line calls another function `func_2()` and assigns its return value to `arr`. The initial state defines `arr` as a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, so its value is updated to the returned list. The third line assigns the value `-1` to `pos`, which was initially defined as the index of `k` in `arr`. Since `pos` is now set to `-1`, it no longer represents the index of `k` in `arr`.

In summary, the code updates the values of `n`, `k`, and `arr` based on the return values of `func_1()` and `func_2()`, and sets `pos` to `-1`, which is no longer related to the index of `k` in `arr`.
