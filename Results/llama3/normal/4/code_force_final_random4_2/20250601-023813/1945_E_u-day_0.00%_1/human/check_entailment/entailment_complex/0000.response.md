Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described. The program uses a binary search algorithm to find the target value `k` in a list of distinct integers `arr`. If `k` is found at the index `low`, it prints 0. If `k` is not found at `low`, it prints 1, followed by the index `low + 1` and the actual position of `k` in the list (`pos + 1`).

The program correctly implements the binary search algorithm and handles the cases where `k` is found at the index `low` and where it is not. The program also correctly prints the result and the indices as required by the problem statement.

However, the program does not actually perform the swap operation as described in the problem statement. Instead, it simply prints the indices that would be swapped. This is not a correct implementation of the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
