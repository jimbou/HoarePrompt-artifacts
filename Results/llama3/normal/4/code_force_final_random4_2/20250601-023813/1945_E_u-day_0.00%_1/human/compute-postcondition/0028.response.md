Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `arr` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, `i` is n-1, `pos` is either n-1 or -1 depending on whether arr[n-1] is equal to k or not, `low` is (n-1 + high) // 2, `high` is at least n, `st` is a set containing the value (n-1 + high) // 2 and mid, `mid` is (n-1 + high) // 2**

In this output state, the value of `low` has been updated to be equal to `mid`, which is `(n-1 + high) // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `low` is now dependent on the values of `n` and `high`.
