Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `arr` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, `i` is n-1, `low` is (low + high) // 2, `high` is n-1, `st` is a set containing the value (low + high) // 2, `pos` is either n-1 or -1 depending on whether arr[n-1] is equal to k or not, `mid` is (low + high) // 2, and arr[mid] is less than or equal to k**

In this output state, the value of `low` has been updated to be the value of `mid`, which is the average of the previous `low` and `high` values. The other variables remain unchanged. The set `st` still contains the value `(low + high) // 2`, which is now equal to the new value of `low`. The value of `mid` is also updated to be the new average of `low` and `high`. The condition that `arr[mid]` is less than or equal to `k` still holds.
