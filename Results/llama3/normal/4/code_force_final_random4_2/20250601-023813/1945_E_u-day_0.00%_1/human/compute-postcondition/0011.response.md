Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `arr` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, `i` is `n-1`. If `arr[i]` is equal to `k`, then `pos` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `pos` remains -1.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for `n`, `k`, and `arr` as in the initial state. The variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, which is the last index of the loop. The value of `pos` will be the index of the element in `arr` that is equal to `k`, or -1 if no such element is found.
