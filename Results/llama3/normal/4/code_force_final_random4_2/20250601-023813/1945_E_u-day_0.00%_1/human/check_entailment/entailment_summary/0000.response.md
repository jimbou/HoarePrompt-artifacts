Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem described. The program consists of multiple functions, but the main logic is in function `func_3()`. This function reads the input, finds the position of the target value `k` in the list `arr`, and then performs a binary search to find the correct position of `k`. If `k` is found at the correct position, it prints 0. If `k` is not found at the correct position, it prints 1, followed by the index where `k` should be and the actual position of `k` in the list.

The program correctly implements the binary search algorithm and handles the case where the target value is not found at the correct position. The program also correctly prints the result and the indices as required by the problem statement.

However, the program does not actually swap the elements in the list as described in the problem statement. Instead, it simply prints the indices where the swap should be performed. This is not a correct implementation of the problem statement, which requires the program to perform the swap operation.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
