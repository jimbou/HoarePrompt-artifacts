The code prints the value of `low + 1` and `pos + 1`. 

Since `low` is equal to `high`, `low + 1` is equal to `high + 1`. 

The value of `pos` is not explicitly defined in the precondition, so we can't determine its exact value. However, we can describe its value as `pos + 1`, where `pos` is the value of `pos`.

Output: **high + 1, pos + 1 (where pos is the value of pos)**
