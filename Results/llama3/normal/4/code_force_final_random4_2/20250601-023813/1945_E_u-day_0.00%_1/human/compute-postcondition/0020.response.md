According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `low` and `high`. If `low + 1` is less than `high`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `low` is either 0 or `(low + high) // 2`, and `high` is either `(low + high) // 2` or `n-1`. However, these values do not ensure that the loop will execute again, so they need to be adjusted. `low` must be less than `n-2` and `high` must be greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n is greater than 2, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, i is n-1, pos is either n-1 or -1 depending on whether arr[n-1] is equal to k or not, low is less than n-2, high is greater than 1, mid is (low + high) // 2, and st is a set containing the value (low + high) // 2.**
