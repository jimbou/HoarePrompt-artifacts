The first line assigns the integer values of the input to `n` and `k`. Since `t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 500, and there are `t-5` test cases in stdin, after reading two integers, there are `t-6` test cases left in stdin. The second line assigns a list of `k-1` integers from stdin to `l`. Since `k-1` is printed, this value is no longer in stdin. The value of `i` is not affected by the code.

Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 500, i is 2, n is an integer, k is an integer, l is a list of k-1 integers, stdin contains t-6 test cases**
