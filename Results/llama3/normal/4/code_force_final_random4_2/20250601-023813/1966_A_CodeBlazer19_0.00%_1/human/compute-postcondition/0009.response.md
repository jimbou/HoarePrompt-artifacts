To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 500. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.

The state of `t` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 500, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of k-1 integers, stdin contains t-5 test cases, and k - 1 is printed**
