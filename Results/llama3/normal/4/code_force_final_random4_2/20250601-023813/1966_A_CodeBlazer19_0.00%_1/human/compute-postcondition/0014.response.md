Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers (n and k) followed by a list of n integers. It then prints the value of k-1 for each test case, without modifying the input values. The function processes a variable number of test cases (between 1 and 500), and its output consists of the repeated values of k-1, one for each test case.**
