Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 500, i is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, l is a list of integers, stdin contains t-1 test cases**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The code reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input and assigns them to the corresponding variables. It then reads a list of integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `l`. The number of test cases in the input is reduced by 1 as the code has processed one test case.
