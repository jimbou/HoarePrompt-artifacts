Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), i is t-1, n is an integer, k is an integer, l is a list of integers, stdin is empty, and the value of k-1 has been printed t times.**

In natural language, this output state means that the loop has executed for all the test cases (t times), and the value of k-1 has been printed for each test case. The loop has finished executing, and the program has terminated.
