The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` test cases, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 500, `i` is 0, stdin contains `t` test cases**
