The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 500) followed by `t` test cases. Since the first integer is assigned to `t`, the stdin now contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n <= 100, 2 <= k <= 100). The second line contains `n` integers `c_1, c_2, ..., c_n` (1 <= c_i <= 100).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n <= 100, 2 <= k <= 100). The second line contains `n` integers `c_1, c_2, ..., c_n` (1 <= c_i <= 100).**
