Functionality: **The function reads a number of test cases from standard input, then for each test case, it reads an integer n and calculates a sum based on a formula involving squares of numbers up to n. It then prints the calculated sum and the value of n + n, followed by a series of lines containing the numbers from 1 to n, the value of n, and the numbers from 1 to n again. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the standard input empty.**
