To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 2, because the range starts from 2. 

Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `sum` is 1, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one. However, these states do not directly affect the execution of the loop.

So, for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2, and `i` is now 2.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `sum` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 2**
