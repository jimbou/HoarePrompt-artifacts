Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `sum` is the sum of the series (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i for i from 2 to n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n + 1`**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the values of `sum`, `i`, and `j`. The value of `sum` is the sum of the series `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` for `i` from 2 to `n`. The value of `i` is `n + 1`, and the value of `j` is also `n + 1`. The values of `t`, `_`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
