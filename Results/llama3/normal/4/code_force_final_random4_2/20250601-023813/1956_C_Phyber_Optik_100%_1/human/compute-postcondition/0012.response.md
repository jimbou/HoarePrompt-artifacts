Output: ** `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `sum` is 1 + ∑((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i) for i from 2 to n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n + 1, and this is printed: the sum which is equal to 1 + ∑((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i) for i from 2 to n and the value of n + n**
