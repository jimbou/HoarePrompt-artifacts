To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 0 and `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive. For the loop to execute again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `sum` is 1 + âˆ‘((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i) for i from 2 to n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n + 1, `j` is n + 1, and this is printed: 2, 1, and the numbers from 1 to n**
