According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `j` is now 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `sum` is 1 + âˆ‘((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i) for i from 2 to n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n + 1, `j` is 1**
