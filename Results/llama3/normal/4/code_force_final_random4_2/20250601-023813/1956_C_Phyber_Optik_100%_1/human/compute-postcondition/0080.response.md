The code prints the number 1, the value of `n - j + 1` (where `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3 and `j` is 3), and the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) in a sequence.

Since `j` is 3, `n - j + 1` simplifies to `n - 2`.

The `*range(1, n + 1)` part of the print statement generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

Therefore, the output will be the number 1, the value of `n - 2`, and the sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`.

Output: **1, n - 2, 1, 2, 3, ..., n (where n is an integer greater than or equal to 3)**
