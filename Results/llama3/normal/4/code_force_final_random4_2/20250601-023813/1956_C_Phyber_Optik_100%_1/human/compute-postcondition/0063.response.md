Let's break down the code step by step:

1. `sum` is updated by adding the result of the expression `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i`.
2. The expression `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1))` can be simplified as `(i^2 - (i-1)^2)`, which is equal to `2*i - 1`.
3. So, the expression becomes `(2*i - 1) * i`.
4. Since `i` is 3, the expression becomes `(2*3 - 1) * 3 = 5 * 3 = 15`.
5. Therefore, `sum` is updated to `7 + 15 = 22`.

The values of the other variables are not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `sum` is 22, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 3, `j` is `n + 1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `sum` has been updated to 22, while all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `t` is still between 2 and 500, `_` is still 2, `n` is still greater than or equal to 3, `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is still 3, and `j` is still `n + 1`.
