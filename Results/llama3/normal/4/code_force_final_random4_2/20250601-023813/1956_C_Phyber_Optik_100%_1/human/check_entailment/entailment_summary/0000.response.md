Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix by using the formula for the sum of squares of numbers up to n. It then prints the calculated sum and the number of operations, which is 2n. The program also correctly prints the operations to achieve the maximum sum, which involves setting each row and column to the numbers from 1 to n.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the solution to the problem. The execution summary also confirms that the program behaves as expected, reading input, calculating the sum, and printing the results.

Correctness: **True**
