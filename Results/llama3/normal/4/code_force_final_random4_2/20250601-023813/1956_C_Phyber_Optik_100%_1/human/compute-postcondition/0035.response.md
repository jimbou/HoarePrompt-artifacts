Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `sum` is 1 + 2 * (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is at least 3 and at most `n`, `j` is `n + 1`, and this is printed: 2, 1, and the numbers from 1 to `n`, and the value of `n`.**

In this output state, the value of `sum` has been updated by adding the expression `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still at least 3 and at most `n`, and the value of `j` is still `n + 1`. The input from `stdin` has not been affected, and the printed output remains the same.
