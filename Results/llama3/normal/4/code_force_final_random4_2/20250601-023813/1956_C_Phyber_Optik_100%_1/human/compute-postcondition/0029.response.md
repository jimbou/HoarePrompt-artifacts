Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `sum` is 1 + âˆ‘((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i) for i from 2 to n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n + 1, `j` is n + 1, and this is printed: 2, 1, and the numbers from 1 to n.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop variable `j` has reached its final value of `n + 1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The other variables remain unchanged, with `t` still being an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` being 0, `n` being an integer, `sum` being the calculated sum, `stdin` containing multiple test cases minus one, and `i` being `n + 1`. The output printed is the final iteration of the loop, which prints 2, 1, and the numbers from 1 to `n`.
