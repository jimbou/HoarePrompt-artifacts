Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, _ is 2, n is an integer, sum is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is n + 1, j is n + 1**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `n` was previously an integer, its value is updated to the input value. The second line assigns the value 1 to `sum`, overwriting its previous value. The value of `sum` is now 1, regardless of its previous value. The values of `t`, `_`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Stdin now contains one less test case.
