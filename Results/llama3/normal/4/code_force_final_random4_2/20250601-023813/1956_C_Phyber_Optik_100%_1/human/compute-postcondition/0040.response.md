Output: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `sum` is 1 + Σ((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i) from i = 2 to n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n + 1`, and this is printed: 2, 1, and the numbers from 1 to `n`, and the value of `n`, and this is printed: the value of `sum` which is 1 + Σ((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i) from i = 2 to n, and the value of `n + n` which is 2 times the value of `n`**
