Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `sum` is 1 + Σ((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i) from i = 2 to n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n + 1`, and this is printed: 2, 1, and the numbers from 1 to `n`, and the value of `n`, and this is printed: the value of `sum` which is 1 + Σ((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i) from i = 2 to n, and the value of `n + n` which is 2 times the value of `n`.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, with the only changes being in the loop head and body. The loop has iterated `n` times, printing the numbers from 1 to `n` and the value of `n` each time, and the value of `sum` and `n + n` at the end. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
