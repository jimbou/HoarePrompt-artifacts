The code prints the number 1, the value of `n` minus `j` plus 1 (where `n` is greater than 1 and `j` is 3), and the numbers from 1 to `n` (where `n` is greater than 1). Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `n - j + 1`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `n - j + 1` and the numbers from 1 to `n`.

Output: ** `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `sum` is 1 + âˆ‘((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i) for i from 2 to n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n + 1, `j` is 3, and this is printed: 1, n - 2, and the numbers from 1 to n**
