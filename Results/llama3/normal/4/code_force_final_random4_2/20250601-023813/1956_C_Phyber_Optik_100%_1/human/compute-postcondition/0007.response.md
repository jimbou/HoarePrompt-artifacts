Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `sum` is 1 + (2 * 2 - (2 - 1) * (2 - 1)) * 2 + (3 * 3 - (3 - 1) * (3 - 1)) * 3, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 3**

The code adds the value of `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` to the variable `sum`, where `i` is 3. The initial value of `sum` is 1 + (2 * 2 - (2 - 1) * (2 - 1)) * 2. The new value of `sum` is the sum of the initial value and the added value, which is 1 + (2 * 2 - (2 - 1) * (2 - 1)) * 2 + (3 * 3 - (3 - 1) * (3 - 1)) * 3. The values of the other variables are not affected.
