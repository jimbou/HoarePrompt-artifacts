The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `j` is increased by 1 so `j` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `sum` is 1 + Î£((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i) from i = 2 to n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is 2, and this is printed: 2, n, and a sequence of numbers from 1 to n**
