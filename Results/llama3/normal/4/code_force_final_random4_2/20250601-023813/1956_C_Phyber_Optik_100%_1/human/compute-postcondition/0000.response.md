The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of `t` to be the integer conversion of the first input from stdin. Since the first line of stdin contains the number of test cases `t` (1 <= t <= 500), `t` is assigned a value between 1 and 500 inclusive. The remaining test cases are still in stdin. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases.**
