The code prints the value of `sum` which is the sum of the series (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i for i from 2 to n, and the value of `n + n` which is twice the value of `n`. Where `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2.
Output: **sum (which is the sum of the series (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i for i from 2 to n), 2n (where n is an integer greater than or equal to 2)**
