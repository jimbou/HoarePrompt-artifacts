According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `sum` is 1 + Î£((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i) from i = 2 to n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is 3, and this is printed: 2, n - 1, and a sequence of numbers from 1 to n**
