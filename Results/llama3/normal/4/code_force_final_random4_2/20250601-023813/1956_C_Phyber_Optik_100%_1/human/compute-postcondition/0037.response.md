Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer that must be at least 4, `sum` is 1 + 2 * (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i + (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is at least 4 and at most `n + 1`, `j` is `n + 1`, and this is printed: 2, 1, and the numbers from 1 to `n`, and the value of `n`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains between 1 and 500 inclusive, and the value of `_` is still 1. The value of `n` is still at least 4. The value of `sum` has been updated by adding the result of the expression `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` to its previous value. The number of test cases in `stdin` is still two less than the initial number. The value of `i` is still between 4 and `n + 1` inclusive, and the value of `j` is still `n + 1`. The same output is still printed: 2, 1, and the numbers from 1 to `n`, and the value of `n`.
