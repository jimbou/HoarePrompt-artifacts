Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, _ is 0, n is an integer, sum is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

The code reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`, reducing the number of test cases in stdin by one. It then initializes the variable `sum` to 1. The value of `t` and `_` remains unchanged.
