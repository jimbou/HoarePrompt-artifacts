Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `sum` is 1 + âˆ‘((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i) for i from 2 to n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n + 1**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for `t` and `_` as in the initial state. The value of `n` will remain the same as it was before the loop started. The value of `sum` will be the result of the summation of the expression `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` for all `i` from 2 to `n`. The state of `stdin` will still contain multiple test cases minus one. The value of `i` will be `n + 1`, indicating that the loop has finished executing all its iterations.
