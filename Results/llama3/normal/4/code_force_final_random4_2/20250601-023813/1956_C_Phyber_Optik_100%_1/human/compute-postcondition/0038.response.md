Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `sum` is 1 + Î£((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i) from i = 2 to n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n + 1`, and this is printed: 2, 1, and the numbers from 1 to `n`, and the value of `n`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that the variable `t` remains an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, the variable `_` remains 1, the variable `n` remains an integer, the variable `sum` is the sum of the expression `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` for all `i` from 2 to `n` plus 1, the standard input `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus two, the variable `i` is now `n + 1`, the variable `j` is still `n + 1`, and the output includes the numbers 2, 1, the numbers from 1 to `n`, and the value of `n`.
