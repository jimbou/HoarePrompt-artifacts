To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 3, because the range starts from 2 and goes up to `n` (inclusive). Since `i` is the loop variable, it should start at 2 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `sum` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 2, `j` is `n + 1`**
