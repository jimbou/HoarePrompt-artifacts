The only objects in the loop head are variables  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable j and n. If j is less than n + 1 the loop executes again for the next time. At the end of the last iteration, j is 1, n is greater than 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time j is 2 and n must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `sum` is 1 + âˆ‘((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i) for i from 2 to n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n + 1, `j` is 2**
