The `print` statement will print a sequence of numbers. The first number printed is 1. The second number printed is `n - j + 1`, where `n` is a value greater than 1 and `j` is 2. So, the second number printed is `n - 1`. 

The third part of the print statement, `*range(1, n + 1)`, prints a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive). 

Since `n` must be greater than 1, the sequence of numbers printed will always start with 1 and end with `n`. 

However, the exact value of `n` is not provided, so we can't compute the exact numerical sequence that will be printed.

Output: **1, n - 1, and a sequence of numbers from 1 to n (where n is a value greater than 1)**
