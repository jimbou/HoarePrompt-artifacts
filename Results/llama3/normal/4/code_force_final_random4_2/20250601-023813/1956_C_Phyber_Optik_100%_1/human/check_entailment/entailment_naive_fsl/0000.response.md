Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when n = 1. In this case, the program prints "1 2" which means it is performing 2 operations, but it only needs to perform 1 operation to maximize the sum. The correct output for this case should be "1 1" followed by "1 1 1". 

The issue is with the line `print(sum, n + n)`. This line always prints `n + n` as the number of operations, but it should print `n` when `n` is 1. 

To fix this issue, the program should handle the case when `n` is 1 separately. 

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        sum = 1
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i
        if n == 1:
            print(sum, 1)
            print(1, 1, 1)
        else:
            print(sum, n + n)
            for j in range(1, n + 1):
                print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
                print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```
