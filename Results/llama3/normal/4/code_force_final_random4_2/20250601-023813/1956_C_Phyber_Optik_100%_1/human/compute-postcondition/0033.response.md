Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `sum` is 1 + (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is at least 2 and at most `n`, `j` is `n + 1`, and this is printed: 2, 1, and the numbers from 1 to `n`, and the value of `n`.**

In this output state, the value of `sum` has been updated by adding the result of the expression `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` to its previous value of 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
