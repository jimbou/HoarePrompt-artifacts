Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `sum` is 1 + (2 * 2 - (2 - 1) * (2 - 1)) * 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `sum` has been updated to include the result of the expression `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i`, where `i` is 2. This expression simplifies to `(2 * 2 - (2 - 1) * (2 - 1)) * 2`, which is equal to `(4 - 1) * 2`, which is equal to `3 * 2`, which is equal to `6`. Therefore, the new value of `sum` is `1 + 6`, which is equal to `7`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
