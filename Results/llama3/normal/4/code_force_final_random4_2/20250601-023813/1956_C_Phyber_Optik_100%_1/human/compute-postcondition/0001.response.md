The only variables in the loop head are variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, which ensures that the loop will execute. So, we need to adjust the state of `_` to be 0, since it will be the first iteration of the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases.**
