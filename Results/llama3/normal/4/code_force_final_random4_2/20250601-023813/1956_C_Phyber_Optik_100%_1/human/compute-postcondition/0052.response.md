The code prints the number 1, the value of `n - j + 1` (where `n` is greater than 2 and `j` is 3), and a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `n - j + 1`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `n - j + 1` and the sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`.
Output: **1, n - 2, 1, 2, 3, ..., n (where n is greater than 2)**
