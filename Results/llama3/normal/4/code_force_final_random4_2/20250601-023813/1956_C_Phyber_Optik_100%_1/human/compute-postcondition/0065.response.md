Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `sum` is 22 + (4 * 4 - (4 - 1) * (4 - 1)) * 4, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 4, `j` is `n + 1`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `sum` has been updated by adding the result of the expression `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` to its previous value, where `i` is 4. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
