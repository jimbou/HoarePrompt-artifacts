The code prints the number 2, the value of `n - j + 1` (where `n` is greater than 0 and `j` is 1), and a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (where `n` is greater than 0).
Output: ** `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `sum` is 1 + Î£((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i) from i = 2 to n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is 1, and this is printed: 2, n, and a sequence of numbers from 1 to n**
