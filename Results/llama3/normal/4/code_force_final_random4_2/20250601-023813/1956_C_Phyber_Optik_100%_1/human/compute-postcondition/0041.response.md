To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `sum` is 1 + Î£((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i) from i = 2 to n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is 1**
