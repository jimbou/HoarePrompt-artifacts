Based on the initial state, let's break down the variables and objects involved in the print statement:

* `sum`: This is the sum of a series of calculations, specifically 1 + Σ((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i) from i = 2 to n. Since `n` is an integer, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `sum` without knowing the value of `n`. However, we can describe it as the sum of the series up to `n`.
* `n + n`: This is simply twice the value of `n`, which is an integer.

Now, let's consider the print statement:

`print(sum, n + n)`

The print statement will output two values: the value of `sum` and the value of `n + n`.

Output: **sum (where sum is the sum of the series 1 + Σ((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i) from i = 2 to n), 2n (where n is an integer)**
