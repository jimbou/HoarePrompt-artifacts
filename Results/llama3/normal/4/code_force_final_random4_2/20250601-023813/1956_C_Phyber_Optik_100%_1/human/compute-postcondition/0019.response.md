The `print` statement will print a sequence of numbers. 

First, it will print the number 1. 

Then, it will print the value of `n - j + 1`. Since `j` is 2, this expression simplifies to `n - 1`. 

Finally, it will print all numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) using the `range` function. 

Since `n` must be greater than 1, the output will always start with 1, followed by `n - 1`, and then all numbers from 1 to `n`.

Output: **1, n - 1, 1, 2, 3, ..., n (where n is a value greater than 1)**
