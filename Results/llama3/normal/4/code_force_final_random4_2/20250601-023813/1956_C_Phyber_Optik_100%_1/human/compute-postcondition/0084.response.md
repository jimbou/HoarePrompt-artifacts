Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `sum` is the sum of the series (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i for i from 2 to n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n + 1`, and this is printed: the sum of the series (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i for i from 2 to n and 2n**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, with the only difference being that `j` is now `n + 1` instead of `n + 1`. This means that the loop has finished executing and the variables have returned to their initial values.
