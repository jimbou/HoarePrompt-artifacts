According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 4, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `sum` is 22, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 4, `j` is `n + 1`**
