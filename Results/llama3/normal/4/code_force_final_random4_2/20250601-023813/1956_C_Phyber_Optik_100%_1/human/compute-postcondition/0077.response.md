The code prints the number 2, the value of `n - j + 1` which is `n - 1` since `j` is 2, and the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) generated by the `range(1, n + 1)` function.

Since `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, the output will be a sequence of numbers starting with 2, followed by `n - 1`, and then the numbers from 1 to `n`.

Output: **2, n - 1, 1, 2, 3, ..., n (where n is an integer greater than or equal to 2)**
