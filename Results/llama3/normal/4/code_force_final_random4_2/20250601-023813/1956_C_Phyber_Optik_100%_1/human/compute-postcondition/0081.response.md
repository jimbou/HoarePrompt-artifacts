The code prints the number 1, the value of `n - j + 1` which is `n - 2` since `j` is 3, and the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
Output: ** `t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `sum` is the sum of the series (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i for i from 2 to n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is 3, and this is printed: 1, n - 2, and the numbers from 1 to n inclusive**
