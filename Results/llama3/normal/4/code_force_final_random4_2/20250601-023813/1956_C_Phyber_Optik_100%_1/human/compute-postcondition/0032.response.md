According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is `n + 1`, which is out of the range of the loop. So, `i` needs to be adjusted to be within the range of the loop. The range of the loop is from 2 to `n` (inclusive), so `i` should be at least 2 and at most `n`.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `sum` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is at least 2 and at most `n`, `j` is `n + 1`, and this is printed: 2, 1, and the numbers from 1 to `n`, and the value of `n`**
