The code prints the number 1, the value of `n - j + 1` (where `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and `j` is 1), and the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) in a sequence.

Since `j` is 1, `n - j + 1` simplifies to `n`. Therefore, the code prints 1, `n`, and the numbers from 1 to `n` in a sequence.

Output: **1, n, 1, 2, 3, ..., n (where n is an integer greater than or equal to 2)**
