The code prints the value of `sum` which is 1 plus the sum of the terms calculated as `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` for `i` ranging from 2 to `n`, and the value of `n + n` which is twice the value of `n`.

Output: **1 + âˆ‘((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i) for i from 2 to n, 2n (where n is the value of n)**
