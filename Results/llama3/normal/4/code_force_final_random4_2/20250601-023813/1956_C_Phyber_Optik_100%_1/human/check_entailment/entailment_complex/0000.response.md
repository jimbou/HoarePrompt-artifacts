Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n` and calculates the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix using the formula `1 + âˆ‘((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i) for i from 2 to n`. This formula is correct based on the problem description.
3. The program then prints the calculated sum and the value of `n + n`, which represents the number of operations required to achieve the maximum sum.
4. The program then prints a series of lines containing the numbers from 1 to `n`, the value of `n`, and the numbers from 1 to `n` again. This represents the operations required to achieve the maximum sum, where each line corresponds to a Type 1 or Type 2 operation.
5. The program correctly handles the case where `n` is 1, where the maximum sum is 1 and only one operation is required.

Overall, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem and produces the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
