The only variable in the loop head is variable `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute again `j` is increased by 1 so `j` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `sum` is the sum of the series (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i for i from 2 to n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is 3**
