Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `sum` is 1 + âˆ‘((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i) for i from 2 to n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n + 1, `j` is n, and this is printed: 2, 1, and the numbers from 1 to n.

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `j` will be equal to `n`, and the last two print statements will have printed the numbers 2 and 1, followed by the numbers from 1 to `n`. The other variables remain unchanged.
