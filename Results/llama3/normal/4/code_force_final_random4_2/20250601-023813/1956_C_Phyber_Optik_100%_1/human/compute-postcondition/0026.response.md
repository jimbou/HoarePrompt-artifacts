The code prints the number 2, the value of `n - j + 1` (where `n` is greater than 1 and `j` is 3), and the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

Since `n` is greater than 1, `n - j + 1` will be `n - 2`.

The `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

Output: **2, n - 2, 1, 2, 3, ..., n (where n is greater than 1)**
