The only objects in the loop head are variables  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable j and n.  If j is less than n + 1 the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, j is 1, n is greater than or equal to 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time j is 2 and n must be greater than or equal to 2.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `sum` is the sum of the series (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i for i from 2 to n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is 2**
