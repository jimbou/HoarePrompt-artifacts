The code prints the value 1, the value of `n - j + 1` which is `n - 1` since `j` is 2, and the range of numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
Since `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, the value of `n - 1` will be at least 1, and the range of numbers will start from 1 and go up to `n`.
Output: ** `t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `sum` is the sum of the series (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i for i from 2 to n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is 2, and this is printed: 1, n - 1, and the numbers from 1 to n**
