Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer that must be at least 4, `sum` is 1 + (2 * 2 - (2 - 1) * (2 - 1)) * 2 + (3 * 3 - (3 - 1) * (3 - 1)) * 3 + (4 * 4 - (4 - 1) * (4 - 1)) * 4, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 4**

In this output state, the value of `sum` has been updated by adding the result of the expression `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` where `i` is 4. The other variables remain unchanged.
