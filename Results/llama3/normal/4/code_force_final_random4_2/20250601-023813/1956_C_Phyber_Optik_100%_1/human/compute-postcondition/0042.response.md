The `print` statement will print a sequence of numbers. The first number is 1, the second number is `n - j + 1`, and the remaining numbers are a range of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

Since `j` is 1, the second number is `n - 1 + 1`, which simplifies to `n`.

The `*range(1, n + 1)` part of the print statement will print a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

So, the output will be a sequence of numbers starting with 1, followed by `n`, and then a range of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

Output: **1, n, 1, 2, 3, ..., n (where n is the value of n)**
