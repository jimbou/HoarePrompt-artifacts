Output State: **`t` is 0, `_` is `t`, `n` is an integer, `sum` is 1 + ∑((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i) for i from 2 to n, `stdin` is empty, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n + 1`, and this is printed: 2, 1, and the numbers from 1 to `n`, and the value of `n`, and this is printed: the value of `sum` which is 1 + Σ((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i) from i = 2 to n, and the value of `n + n` which is 2 times the value of `n`**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: The loop has finished executing, and the variable `t` is now 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The variable `_` has reached its final value, which is the initial value of `t`. The variable `n` still holds an integer value, and the variable `sum` holds the final sum of the series calculated in the loop. The standard input `stdin` is now empty, as all test cases have been read. The loop variables `i` and `j` have reached their final values, which are `n + 1`. The output includes the final values of `sum`, `n`, and the numbers from 1 to `n`, as well as the value of `n + n`.
