Output State: `t` is 0, `_` is `t`, `n` is an integer, `sum` is 1 + Î£((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i) from i = 2 to n, `stdin` is empty, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n + 1`, and this is printed: the sum of the series (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i for i from 2 to n and 2n, and the value of `n`, and this is printed: 2, 1, and the numbers from 1 to `n`.

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the variable `t` will be 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The variable `_` will be equal to the initial value of `t`, indicating the number of iterations that have been executed. The variable `n` will still be an integer, but its value will be the last value read from `stdin`. The variable `sum` will be the sum of the series (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i for i from 2 to `n`, where `n` is the last value read from `stdin`. The variable `stdin` will be empty, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The variables `i` and `j` will be `n + 1`, indicating that the inner loops have finished executing. The output will include the sum of the series (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i for i from 2 to `n` and 2 times the value of `n`, as well as the value of `n` itself, and the numbers from 1 to `n` printed twice.
