The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 3 and at most `n`, `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is at least 4 and at most `n + 1` and for the loop to execute again `n` must be at least 4.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer that must be at least 4, `sum` is 1 + 2 * (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is at least 4 and at most `n + 1`, `j` is `n + 1`, and this is printed: 2, 1, and the numbers from 1 to `n`, and the value of `n`.**
