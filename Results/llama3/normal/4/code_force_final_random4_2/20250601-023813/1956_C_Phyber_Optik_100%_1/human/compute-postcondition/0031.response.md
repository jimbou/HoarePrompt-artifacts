Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, _ is 1, n is an integer, sum is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is n + 1, j is n + 1, and this is printed: 2, 1, and the numbers from 1 to n, and the value of n**

The code first reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`. This reduces the number of test cases in stdin by one. The second line resets the value of `sum` to 1, overwriting its previous value. No other variables are affected by the code. The final state includes the updated values of `n` and `sum`, as well as the remaining test cases in stdin.
