To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. Since `n` is already an integer greater than or equal to 2, it meets this condition. However, `j` is currently `n + 1`, which is outside the range of the loop. To ensure the loop executes, `j` should be adjusted to be within the range of the loop, which is from 1 to `n` (inclusive). Therefore, `j` should be adjusted to be 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `sum` is the sum of the series (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i for i from 2 to n, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is 1**
