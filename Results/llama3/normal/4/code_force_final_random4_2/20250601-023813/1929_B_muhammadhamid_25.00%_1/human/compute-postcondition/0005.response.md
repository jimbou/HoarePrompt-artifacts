The code `continue` skips the rest of the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration of the loop. Since the initial state mentions that the number 1 is being printed, it is likely that the code is inside a loop that prints numbers. The `continue` statement will skip the rest of the current iteration and move on to the next number to be printed.

The values of the variables `_`, `n`, and `k` are not affected by the `continue` statement. The stdin still contains at least one test case minus one input.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is 1, stdin contains at least one test case minus one input, and the number 2 is being printed.**
