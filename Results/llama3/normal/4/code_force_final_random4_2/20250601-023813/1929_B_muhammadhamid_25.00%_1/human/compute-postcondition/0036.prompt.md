Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two integers: n and k, where n is a positive integer and k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 4n - 2.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if k == 1:
        print(1)
        continue
    if k <= 2 * n:
        print(math.ceil(k / 2))
    else:
        print(k // 2 + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *_ is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, stdin contains at least one test case minus one input, and if `k` is 1, the number 2 is being printed. If `k` is less than or equal to 2 times the value of `n`, the ceiling of `k` divided by 2 is being printed. Otherwise, the value of `k` divided by 2 plus 1 is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *_ is 1, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, and stdin contains at least one test case minus two inputs. If k is 1, the rest of the current iteration is skipped and the program moves to the next iteration of the loop. If k is less than or equal to 2 times n, the ceiling of k divided by 2 is being printed. Otherwise, the value of k // 2 + 1 is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, and stdin contains at least one test case minus two inputs. If `k` is 1, the number 1 is printed and the current iteration of the loop is skipped, moving on to the next iteration. Otherwise, if `k` is less than or equal to twice `n`, the ceiling of the division of `k` by 2 is printed. If `k` is greater than twice `n`, the integer division of `k` by 2 plus 1 is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
