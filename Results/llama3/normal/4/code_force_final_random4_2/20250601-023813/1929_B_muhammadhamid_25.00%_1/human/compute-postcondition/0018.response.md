Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, and stdin contains at least one test case minus two inputs, and we skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `_`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least one test case minus two inputs. The only change is that we skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement.
