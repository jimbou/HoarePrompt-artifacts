To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states accordingly.


The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `n` (which is implicitly defined by the `input()` function). The state of `k` and `stdin` are not directly related to the loop head, so we cannot adjust them.


At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 0, and `n` is an integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must be greater than 1.


State: **`_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, stdin contains at least one test case minus one input, and if `k` is 1, the number 2 is being printed. If `k` is less than or equal to 2 times the value of `n`, the ceiling of `k` divided by 2 is being printed. Otherwise, the value of `k` divided by 2 plus 1 is being printed.**
