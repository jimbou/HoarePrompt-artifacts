To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and the expression `int(input())`. The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` is greater than 0.

State: **stdin contains at least one test case, `_` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
