The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` assigns the values from the input to the variables `n` and `k`. Since `input().split()` accepts a space-separated list of integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers, `n` and `k` are assigned integer values.

The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer greater than 2, but the code overwrites this value with the new input. Therefore, the new value of `n` is an integer, but its relationship to 2 is no longer specified.

The initial state also specifies that `k` is an integer, and the code assigns a new integer value to `k`.

The variable `_` is not affected by the code, so its value remains 2.

The stdin contains at least one test case minus one input, but the code consumes one input, so the stdin now contains at least one test case minus two inputs.

Output State: **`_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, and stdin contains at least one test case minus two inputs.**
