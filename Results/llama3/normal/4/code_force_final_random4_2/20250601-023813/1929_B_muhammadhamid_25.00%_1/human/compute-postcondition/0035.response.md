Postcondition: **`_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, and stdin contains at least one test case minus two inputs. If `k` is 1, the number 1 is printed and the current iteration of the loop is skipped, moving on to the next iteration. Otherwise, if `k` is less than or equal to twice `n`, the ceiling of the division of `k` by 2 is printed. If `k` is greater than twice `n`, the integer division of `k` by 2 plus 1 is printed.**
