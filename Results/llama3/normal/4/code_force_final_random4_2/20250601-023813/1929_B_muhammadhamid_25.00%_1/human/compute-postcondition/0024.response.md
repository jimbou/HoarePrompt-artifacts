Postcondition: ***_ is 1, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, and stdin contains at least one test case minus two inputs. If k is 1, the rest of the current iteration is skipped and the program moves to the next iteration of the loop. If k is less than or equal to 2 times n, the ceiling of k divided by 2 is being printed. Otherwise, the value of k // 2 + 1 is being printed.***
