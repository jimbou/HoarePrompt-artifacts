Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, and stdin contains at least one test case minus two inputs.**

The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`, respectively. Since the initial state already specifies that `n` is an integer greater than 1 and `k` is an integer, the values of these variables are updated to the newly read values. The value of `_` remains unchanged. The stdin now contains at least one test case minus two inputs, as two inputs have been read. The conditions related to printing values based on `k` and `n` are no longer applicable, as the values of `k` and `n` have changed.
