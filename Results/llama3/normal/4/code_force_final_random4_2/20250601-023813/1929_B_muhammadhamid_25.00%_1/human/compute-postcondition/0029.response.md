Output State: **`_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, stdin contains at least one test case minus two inputs, and the number 1 is being printed, and we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `_`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least one test case minus two inputs. The number 1 is still being printed. However, the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration.
