To determine what will be printed when the statement executes, let's break down the given information and the code snippet.

The initial state provides the following information:

* `_` is 2 (though this variable is not used in the provided code snippet)
* `n` is an integer
* `k` is an integer
* stdin contains at least one test case minus two inputs (this information is not directly relevant to the print statement but indicates the context of the code, possibly within a loop or conditional structure)

The code snippet contains a single print statement:

```python
print(k // 2 + 1)
```

This statement prints the result of the expression `k // 2 + 1`. Here's how to interpret it:

* `k // 2` performs integer division of `k` by 2, which means it divides `k` by 2 and rounds down to the nearest whole number.
* `+ 1` adds 1 to the result of the division.

Given that `k` is an integer, the expression `k // 2 + 1` effectively calculates the ceiling of half of `k` (i.e., rounds up to the nearest whole number if `k` is odd, or gives exactly half of `k` if `k` is even).

Since the exact value of `k` is not provided, we cannot compute an exact numerical value for the expression. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the result of this calculation.

Output: **The ceiling of half of k (where k is the current value of k)**
