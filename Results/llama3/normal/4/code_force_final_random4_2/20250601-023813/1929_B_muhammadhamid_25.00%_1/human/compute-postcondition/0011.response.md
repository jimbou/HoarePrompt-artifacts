The code prints the result of the expression `k // 2 + 1`, where `k` is an integer larger than 2 times `n`. Since `k` is larger than 2 times `n`, the value of `k // 2` will be greater than `n`. Adding 1 to this value will result in a number greater than `n + 1`.

Output: **a number greater than n + 1 (where n is the given integer greater than 0)**
