Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, stdin contains at least one test case minus one input**

In this output state, the value of `_` remains unchanged as 0. The values of `n` and `k` are assigned from the input, where `n` is an integer greater than 0 and `k` is an integer. The stdin now contains at least one test case minus one input, as one input has been consumed by the `input().split()` function.
