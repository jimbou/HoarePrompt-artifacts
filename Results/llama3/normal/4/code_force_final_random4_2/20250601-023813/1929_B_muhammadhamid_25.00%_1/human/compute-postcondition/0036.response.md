Output State: **_ is the number of test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, and stdin contains no more test cases. If `k` is 1, the number 1 is printed and the current iteration of the loop is skipped, moving on to the next iteration. Otherwise, if `k` is less than or equal to twice `n`, the ceiling of the division of `k` by 2 is printed. If `k` is greater than twice `n`, the integer division of `k` by 2 plus 1 is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the loop counter `_` will have reached the total number of test cases minus 1. The variables `n` and `k` will still be integers, but their values will depend on the last test case processed. The standard input `stdin` will be empty, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The output will depend on the value of `k` in the last test case: if `k` is 1, the output will be 1; if `k` is less than or equal to twice `n`, the output will be the ceiling of `k` divided by 2; and if `k` is greater than twice `n`, the output will be `k` divided by 2 plus 1.
