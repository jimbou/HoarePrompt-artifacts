This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two positive integers, n and k. For each test case, it prints a value based on the relationship between k and n: if k is 1, it prints 1; if k is less than or equal to 2n, it prints the ceiling of k divided by 2; otherwise, it prints k divided by 2 plus 1. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the standard input empty.
