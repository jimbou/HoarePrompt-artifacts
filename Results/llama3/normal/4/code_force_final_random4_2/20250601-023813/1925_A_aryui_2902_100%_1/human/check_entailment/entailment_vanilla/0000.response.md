Reasoning:

The problem requires finding a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. The program provided attempts to solve this problem.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` and calls the function `func_1` with these values.
3. The function `func_1` creates a string `s` by repeating the first `k` lowercase English alphabets `n` times.

Now, let's analyze the correctness of the program:

* The program correctly reads the input values `n` and `k` for each test case.
* The function `func_1` correctly creates a string `s` by repeating the first `k` lowercase English alphabets `n` times.
* However, the program does not check if the created string `s` satisfies the condition that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`.

To verify the correctness of the program, let's consider some examples:

* For `n = 1` and `k = 2`, the program outputs `ab`, which is correct because all possible strings of length 1 (`a` and `b`) occur as a subsequence of `ab`.
* For `n = 2` and `k = 1`, the program outputs `aa`, which is correct because all possible strings of length 2 (`aa`) occur as a subsequence of `aa`.
* For `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the program outputs `abab`, which is incorrect because not all possible strings of length 2 (`ba`) occur as a subsequence of `abab`.

Based on these examples, it appears that the program is not correct for all cases.

Correctness: **False**
