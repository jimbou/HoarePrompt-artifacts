Reasoning: 
The given program is correct because it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. The function `func_1` takes two positive integers `n` and `k` as input, where `1 <= n <= 26` and `1 <= k <= 26`, and returns a string consisting of the first `k` characters of the alphabet, repeated `n` times. This is in line with the problem description, which requires finding a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. The program's logic ensures that the returned string satisfies this property.

Correctness: **True**
