To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is an integer between 2 and 50. To guarantee the loop can execute again, `i` should remain the same, and `n` should be greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 1 if the (p-1)th element of list `l` is equal to `i + 1`, otherwise `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `l` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `p` is the `i`th element of `l`, `q` is the (p-1)th element of `l`, stdin contains `t-1` test cases.**
