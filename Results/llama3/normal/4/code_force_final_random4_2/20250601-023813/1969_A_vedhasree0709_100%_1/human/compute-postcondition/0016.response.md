Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 1 if the (p-1)th element of list `l` is equal to 2, otherwise `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `l` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `p` is the 2nd element of `l`, `q` is the (p-1)th element of `l`, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. The value of `j` depends on the (p-1)th element of list `l`, which is now compared to 2 (i.e., `i + 1`). The values of `n`, `l`, `p`, and `q` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-1 test cases.
