Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 0, l is a list of n integers, i is less than n, p is the ith element of l, q is the (ith element of l - 1)th element of l, j is either 1 or unchanged, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If q is equal to i + 1, then j is set to 1 and the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
