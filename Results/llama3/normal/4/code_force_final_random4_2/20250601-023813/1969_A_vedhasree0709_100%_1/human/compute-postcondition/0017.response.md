According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1. `n` being greater than 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 1 if the (p-1)th element of list `l` is equal to 2, otherwise `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `l` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `p` is the 2nd element of `l`, `q` is the (p-1)th element of `l`, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**
