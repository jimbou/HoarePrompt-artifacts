Postcondition: ***i is 2, j is 1, n is greater than 2, l is a list of n distinct integers, p is the 3rd element of l, q is the (p-1)th element of l, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If q is equal to i + 1, the state of the variables remains unchanged. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
