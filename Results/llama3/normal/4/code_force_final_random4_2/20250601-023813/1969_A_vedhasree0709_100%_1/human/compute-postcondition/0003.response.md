Output State: **i is 0, j is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 50, l is a list of n distinct integers, p is the ith element of l, q is the (p-1)th element of l, stdin contains t-1 test cases**

The code snippet assigns the value of the ith element of list l to p, and the value of the (p-1)th element of list l to q. The values of i, j, n, and l remain unchanged. The value of p is the ith element of l, and the value of q is the (p-1)th element of l. Stdin still contains t-1 test cases.
