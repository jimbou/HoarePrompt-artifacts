Output State: **n is an integer read from stdin, l is a list of n integers read from stdin, i is 0, j is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases**

The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`, replacing its initial value. The second line reads a list of `n` integers from stdin and assigns it to `l`, replacing its initial value. The third line sets `i` to 0, replacing its initial value equal to `n`. The fourth line sets `j` to 0, replacing its initial value of either 0 or 1. Since two lines of input are read from stdin, the number of test cases remaining in stdin is reduced by 1.
