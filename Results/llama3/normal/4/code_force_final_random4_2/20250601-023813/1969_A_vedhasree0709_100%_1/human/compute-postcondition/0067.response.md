Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of `n` integers, `i` is 1 if the (p-1)th element of `l` is equal to 0 + 1, otherwise `i` is increased by 1 from its previous value, `j` is 1 if the (p-1)th element of `l` is equal to 0 + 1, otherwise no change is made to `j`, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `i` is incremented by 1, but its previous value depends on the condition that if the (p-1)th element of `l` is equal to 0 + 1, then `i` is 0 and `j` is 1. If this condition is not met, then `i` is increased by 1 from its previous value. The values of `n`, `l`, and `j` remain the same as in the initial state, and the stdin still contains t-1 test cases.
