Postcondition: ***i is n, j is 0 or 1, n is an integer between 2 and 50, l is a list of n distinct integers, p is the (n-1)th element of l, q is the (p-1)th element of l, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If the (p-1)th element of list l is equal to i + 1, then j is 1. Otherwise, j is 0 and the number 3 is being printed.***
